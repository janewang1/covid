The people were already going through a big change, facing a rising sea and a changing world, and Baalijin went on stirring things up, shaking things up even more ( Figure 1 ).Baalijin is a mischief maker, and he challenges complacency and forces change. He is destruction and creation. Sometimes, he takes things too far, pushing the boundaries of what is perceived and believed. This year, major bushfires and now coronavirus disease 2019 have triggered fear and suffering, forcing just such a shift in boundaries and putting many in danger. On Gumbaynggirr Country, this is Baalijin, whose disruptive energy, like the Dreaming, belongs not just in the past but to all times. We are living this creation story now, of things gone drastically out of balance and being called to walk on the bridge together through big change.In this article, we share some of our thinking as we walk in this story together, particularly in terms of what it might mean as we walk in the midst of COVID-19. We are Aunty Shaa Smith, storyholder for Gumbaynggirr Country, her daughter Neeyan Smith, a young Gumbaynggirr woman and future Elder, and three non-Gumbaynggirr academics, Lara Daley, Sarah Wright, and Paul Hodge. We come together as Yandaarra, a research collective guided by Country, the Old Fellas (ancestors), Elders, and Aunty Shaa. Yandaarra means to shift camp in Gumbaynggirr. It is both what we are called and what we are doing as we walk this re-creation story from our different places as Elders, Custodians, and guests of Country learning to come into proper relationship with Country, each other, and ourselves. For Aunty Shaa and Neeyan, this learning is part of living their custodial responsibilities, sharing knowledge and inviting people into new consciousness at a time when radical change is necessary. For Lara, Sarah, and Paul, coming into relationship means learning our responsibilities and becoming gunganbu, people who belong together well. As Yandaarra, we aim to speak back to colonising histories and presents 1 of research Gumbaynggirr Country is situated on the mid-north coast of eastern Australia. It spans from the Clarence River in the north to the Nambucca River in the south, the Pacific Ocean in the east, and the Great Dividing Range in the west. Gumbaynggirr Country is the homeland of the Gumbaynggirr people; it is what guides and nourishes us. Country is the creative intelligence that binds beings together; it is rich in relations and connections. Country is family. It is the winds, songs, sea, land, and spirits. It is plants and animals, medicine, and food. Country is our dreams, stories, and belongings. We are part of Country ourselves, as we are created by and with it. We are a part of Country's continual emergence.In sharing a Gumbaynggirr-led understanding of COVID-19 with you, we offer a place-based perspective on living this present time of change and instability that is grounded in story and its Law/Lore. Gumbaynggirr Dreaming does not comprise pretty stories to make everyone feel good or enable us to stay in a place of ignorance. There is Law here. When radical changes occur, the Law comes in. We need the Law/Lore to create balance and to call Baalijin to account. Gumbaynggirr stories speak both to how to keep in balance relationships between people and the environment and to what to do when the balance is disrupted; they show how to Juungambala-set things right.In sharing in this way, we join other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander thinkers and collectives (Bawaka et al., 2019a (Bawaka et al., , 2019b (Bawaka et al., , 2020 Ngurra et al., 2019; Martin & Mirraboopa, 2003; Patrick, 2015; Yunkaporta, 2019) , and Indigenous people more broadly (Cajete, 2000; Larsen & Johnson, 2017; Stewart-Harawira, 2005) . Like them, we highlight the need to learn from stories and Law/Lore of place and, most importantly, to change thinking and behaviour based on what we learn. Baalijin is not a metaphor, he is not a trinket to enjoy; but rather he is a being with agency, knowledge, and Law/Lore (see Watts, 2013; Todd, 2016 , for discussion of this point). Our stories help form the basis of our belongings with Country and of Aboriginal sovereignties.In writing this piece together, we contribute to efforts in geography to centre Indigenous ways of knowing and being in geographical knowledge and communication (Bawaka et al., 2016; Porter, Hurst, & Grandinetti, 2020; Wilson, 2015) . The ways in which we communicate in this article come from a place of yarning (Hughes &On Gumbaynggirr Country, Baalijin the mischief maker, like COVID-19, disrupts business as usual, bringing destruction. Yet there is also creation when change is forced upon us. In the story of Wirriiga, the Two Sisters, and of the Dunggiirr, Koala Brothers, and Gurruuja, the whale, and Baalijin, we are reminded-we re-member-that the Law/Lore is there to hold us to account. Gumbaynggirr Country holds stories about when agreements are broken and about how to respond to the changes that happen. In the story, Gurruuja guides the response to Juungambala in order to set things right, guiding the way with love as new agreements are honoured. Let Baalijin and COVID-19 be the wake-up call.Barlo, 2020), a centring of Country and its learning, rather than from the protocols typical of a top-down academic format. We write in this way, we yarn, as a measure of respect for Gumbaynggirr stories, people, knowledges, and Country and to join others who have begun to rebalance academic discourse back away from its tendency to elevate Western ways of knowing and doing that marginalise Indigenous voices (Hughes & Barlo, 2020; Hunt, 2014; Kovach, 2010; Rigney, 1999; Simpson, 2014; Smith, 2013) .We invite you to join us in the story-place, on Dunggiirr's gut-string bridge, so we can walk the changes wrought by COVID-19 together and understand what we are living in terms of relationships fallen out of balance. People are fearful of all the destruction that is happening, and yet we can come to understand that our story is part of the creation time that is happening now; the continual emergence of Country. By living this story about being on the bridge and about Baalijin taking things too far, we can listen more deeply to the wisdom of place and the many more-than-human agencies and co-becomings who want to engage with us. In the story-place, we can hear the call of Country to heed Maangun, the Law/Lore, to bring things into balance and set things right together ( Figure 2 ).As we walk along Dunggiirr's gut-string bridge, we are walking within drastic change. Under our feet are the gutstrings of the Koala Brothers; around us is water where there used to be land. A fundamental Law/Lore has been broken. Waves rise. A shark comes; we have never seen one before. This is a time of great change and danger, and many yearn for security and safety, as if things could go back to how they were before. But Baalijin continues shaking things up, stirring up the ocean (and us!), making people vulnerable, making them afraid, and pushing things out of control. Baalijin takes things too far. The Dunggiirr Brothers want to drown him; things have gotten out of hand.F I G U R E 2 Walking the dreaming today on Dunggiirr's gut-string bridge (Aunty Shaa Smith) F I G U R E 1 Baalijin making mischief, with the bridge in the background (Aunty Shaa Smith) In the story and in this time (for the story is of this time), relationships have indeed fallen out of balance. COVID-19 is Baalijin shaking things up even further when people are already feeling vulnerable after summer bushfires that burnt through vast amounts of Country in 2019-2020. On Gumbaynggirr Country, these bushfires contributed to further loss of habitat for vulnerable species in New South Wales, such as Dunggiirr, koala. The fires severely damaged and disrupted multiple more-than-human communities of soil, plants, insects, animals, and people. At a time when these communities are fragile, the destruction has continued in other ways. Logging has threatened more Country in the Nambucca State forest (Gumbaynggirr Conservation Group, 2020; Koorimail, 2020) as well as in other parts of New South Wales, among them the Comboyne State Forest on Birpai lands (Sati, 2020) .These events are not separate. They are connected as part of a much bigger story of change and destruction that began with colonisation and continues today. For over 200 years, Gumbaynggirr Country has been going through the great change that results from violence against the sacredness of life. Like the Two Sisters, Wirriiga, making the sea, today we are dealing with drastic change. Changing weather, major bushfires, and COVID-19 are only the most recent manifestations of Baalijin's energy in excess, of vital relationships falling further out of balance.This Gumbaynggirr-led perspective resonates with other Indigenous thinking that points to the underlying structures and violence of current events (Coulthard, 2014; Kauanui, 2016; Snelgrove, Dhamoon, & Corntassel, 2014; Whyte, 2018; Wolfe, 2006) . Indigenous thinking expands how COVID-19 can be understood, showing how deeply entangled the destructive relations of resource extraction, unfettered growth, and human exceptionalism are with histories and presents of colonisation. What dominant society names ""unprecedented times"" (Rallah-Baker, 2020) are part of Australia's collective amnesia. For settler-colonial Australia, ""the past,"" as Rose (2004, p. 18 ) describes, is a label for ""that which [settler states] wish to finish and forget, or from which we wish to differentiate ourselves and to absolve ourselves of responsibility.""For hundreds of years, Gumbaynggirr people have been living the reality of shape-shifting colonialism such as ""ecosystem collapse, species loss, economic crash, drastic relocation, and cultural disintegration"" (Whyte, 2018, p. 226 ; see also Callison, 2014) . However, it is only now, as Davis and Todd (2017) argue, that the full ""seismic shock"" of colonial invasion is beginning to reach others living on stolen lands. So although these are certainly intensifying times of change and instability, for the Aboriginal people and their more-than-human relations, this has happened before and is ongoing.As Potowatami scholar and activist Whyte (2018, p. 5) writes:Indigenous peoples challenge linear narratives of dreadful futures of climate destabilization with their own accounts of history that highlight the reality of constant change and emphasize colonialism's role in environmental change.As before, those most marginalised bear the greatest brunt; you can see this pattern throughout the world. People of colour, Indigenous people, and people living in poverty are hit the hardest and suffer most in their health, with their safety, and in their livelihoods. Yet as Lucashenko (2020) recently pointed out as she wrote about COVID-19, there is always more to the Aboriginal story than suffering. Gumbaynggirr people and Country are still strong. The Aboriginal people have thousands of years of experiencing major environmental change, right from the last ice age, and have hundreds of years surviving imperial and colonial violence, attempts at genocide, and massive and consequential environmental changes (see also Davis & Todd, 2017; Risling Baldy, 2014; Stewart-Harawira, 2005; Whyte, 2018) . Here, Gumbaynggirr Custodians Aunty Shaa and Neeyan offer some of our/their insight, speaking from our/their knowledge (not for it-as Yunkaporta (2019) points out), centring Baalijin and Dunggiirr, the Koala Brothers, as we share and encourage all to heed their teachings. Indigenous peoples have already contended with great change and continue to nourish strong relationships with human and more-than-human kin in spite of massive upheavals to Indigenous political and legal systems.When relationships are in balance, Baalijin's energy is important and necessary. Baalijin holds the Law/Lore of questioning the status quo so that when people become complacent, he forces change; he triggers the Law to come in and restore the balance. When things get out of hand on the bridge and move into a place of blatant destruction, the Dunggiirr Koala Brothers want to drown Baalijin. Today, as we live this story again in the present, we have entered into blatant destruction, and relationships are falling out of balance. The Dunggiirr Brothers, who hold the clever energy and call us to nurture creative potential, are not being heard. When the Koala Brothers are not heard, there is not enough of that other clever energy of Dunggiirr that holds the Law/Lore because the voices of Country and its custodians are not being heeded (Figure 3 ).While Baalijin's energy is in excess, it opens the field for both destruction and creation. This story is not only of destruction; it is a re-creation story. We are in that creation now.In the story, the sea comes up, and Country is forever changed. There is sea Country now; there are new beings, new relationships, new stories, and new songs. There is a crumbling of what was, but there is potential for creation to come through. Like the rainbow serpent, the serpent changes land as she moves across country, singing the clans and the languages into existence (Burarrwanga et al., 2019 (Burarrwanga et al., , 2013 . In a sense, she is destroying what was as she creates the new. This transformation too happens within us, deep in ourselves, so we are not standing outside, observing what is happening; we are a part of it; it is transforming us.Guided by Gumbaynggirr wisdom, COVID-19 has forced us in Yandaarra to stop and to question our purpose more deeply. COVID-19, a virus, a more-thanhuman agent that literally lives inside us, moves through, creating disruption, fear, and suffering. Yet we have also been invited to slow down and to listen. COVID-19, like Baalijin, highlights the extent to which our lives are out of sync with the rhythms of Country and exposes the illusion that humans can control Country or live in separation from the web of relationships that nourishes and sustains life. A report from the United Nations (UN) finds this too, calling for a ""one health"" approach that unites human, animal, and environmental health (United Nations Environment Programme and International Livestock Research Institute, 2020). In the story, Dunggiirr, the Koala Brothers, save the people with their guts, their innards, that they throw across the rising sea. It is Dunggiirr who is teaching, guiding, and saving, not the other way around.The story also reminds us there are consequences for breaking the laws that hold relationships in balance. As Aunty Shaa says: COVID shows how disconnected the whole system has become from Country. We are living in a big illusion if we think that people are the ones in power, that they can be in control. Country is beyond the control of humans as we just experienced with the bushfires. The fires and COVID are forcing people to think beyond control. This is forcing people to realise that it's not how Country works. We are not the ones with power. People are in that feeling of vulnerability now.Vulnerability is an important state for transformation. It pushes the boundaries of what is perceived and believed and enables us to let go of destructive patterns so that we can step into a field of creation (compare with Seawright, 2014) . With destruction and creation, a shifting can occur; this does not happen without rumbles.COVID-19 disrupts business as usual. It brings into clarity the many ways that the dominant system is unsustainable and fails to support the wellbeing of people and our Mother Earth. Meanwhile, it is humans who are going through all the rumbles and grumbles of this change. COVID cleaves to existing inequalities, further highlighting its entanglements with ongoing colonisation.Destruction and creation; creation and destruction. Unfortunately, there are many instances where the shift that happens within times of change is not towards balance but away from it. The opportunities we are presented with, to re-think, re-live, and remember, are being passed over and instead greater imbalance is created. Throughout the world, there are so many examples of this trend. Many governments are amassing authoritarian powers that they will likely seek to make permanent, are fast-tracking environmentally destructive projects, and are advancing highly socially restrictive agendas. In the Philippines, President Duterte has pushed through an antiterror law, allowing the Philippine government to detain suspected terrorists without charges for up to F I G U R E 3 The Dunggiirr Brothers using their gut-strings to make the bridge (Aunty Shaa Smith) 24 days. In Australia, representatives of gas companies sit on the COVID Commission Advisory Board looking to expand gas expansion and their profits, including within Aboriginal communities. In the United States, a raft of government policies have been slated, nominally in response to COVID-19, that include detaining citizens, deporting immigrants, and banning abortions.On the other hand, slowing down has meant reconnection, a quietening. And in the quiet, voices are heard, voices that have long been loud and clear but long ignored. Baalijin has brought change. Many are finding that they have had more than enough of racism and inequality, as seen through the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States and around the world, including here in Australia, where large protests have taken place to protest Aboriginal deaths in custody and the ongoing systemic and violent racism that prevails in this country. Problems are coming into the light, becoming more obvious for people to see. Change is happening. People are acknowledging each other more, coming together more, to fight injustice. Bookshops have seen many readers turning to books by Aboriginal and Black authors to learn more about race and racism issues, to finally hear what many Black people have been saying for centuries. So many are under extreme stress at this time, yet they still find time to manifest what they want to align themselves with, what they want to create; this is fighting and healing together, focusing on relationships, on what is dearest. During this time, Aunty Shaa has started healing relationships with plants, beings that hold sacred and vital intelligence and medicine. As Aunty Shaa reflects:Another insight I've come into is that the plants and the Earth are opening a line of communication with me, the plant is open. I can now find that way of communicating to the plant and asking the plant about its medicine, the spirit and energy of the plant and how the plants use that spirit, how they use it for healing. I've come more into that communication.The creation time is now. It is imbued with openings and possibilities. We need to continue this creation story, to arrive at the changed landscape as we come off the koala gut-string bridge and rebuild protocols and relationships and come together to create a new story through which we can heal people and Country and learn to belong well.Many might want to, but it is not possible to go back to how were before, before the Law/Lore was broken and the sea came in. We cannot go back to before colonisation, and we cannot go back to before COVID-19. That time is long past, and yet, and here are both the beauty and the tragedy; they are with us still.While the people were on the bridge, Baalijin continued his mischief by calling in the huge sea creature Gurruuja, the whale. However, Gurruuja could see the people were afraid and reassured them he was there to help them. Gurruuja carried in his huge heart much love and respect for all life, for all life is sacred. He started singing, and his song went straight into the hearts of the people, so they were then filled with the same love and respect.The people felt encouraged and continued on to their drastically changed landscape. They knew they would need to listen to Country to hear the new songs and see the new dances. They would have new responsibilities and new relationships. They would need to make new agreements to be part of the continuation in the sacredness of all life, to set things right, Juungambala, and build again the Law/Lore belonging to peace (Figure 4) .Custodians and Country hold this Law/Lore, the Law/Lore of Country. Listening to Country, to Custodians, will help heal Country and ourselves, both the listened-to and the listener, if it moves towards balance.F I G U R E 4 Gurruuja reassuring the people, guiding the way with love (Aunty Shaa Smith) We need to reweave the threads that have been damaged and nurture the threads that hold us in relationship (Mitchell, 2020; Smith et al., 2020) . We need to be brought back into the proper relationships of Country and the Law/Lore. In this time of great change, we need Indigenous Elders and Custodians, not because they have all the answers but because they have the tools to help guide us, Gumbaynggirr and non-Gumbaynggirr, as we set things right together. Now all of us living on stolen lands, with/as Country, must listen, look, feel, and understand our place. We must go deeper into the symptoms of imbalance and restore fundamental connections with/as Country in order to set things right. For Gumbaynggirr people, there is a memory there. Guided by the Old Fellas (ancestors) and Country, Aunty Shaa and Neeyan are waking this memory, re-membering, and helping people on Gumbaynggirr Country to wake up this memory in themselves, of how to live in balance from a place of connection, of wholeness. As Yandaarra, we understand re-membering, as a putting together that ""pushes past the intended severings of coloniality"" (Grande & McCarty, 2018, p. 166) . On Gumbaynggirr Country, we want to stop the destruction of Country, of us and our soul. Yet we must also attend to the boundaries and barriers in Country, things we should not do and places we should not go. There are also things that not everyone can know. Country is sacred. Baalijin also teaches us this. In the story, he disregarded limits and took things too far, and there were dire consequences for his actions.Spurred on by these times we are living, by COVID, by destruction, and the creation story we are called to walk, Yandaarra is looking to Juungambala, to set things right, and to attend to more-than-human knowledges and sovereignties on Gumbaynggirr Country. More-thanhuman sovereignties are Indigenous-led and, rather than authoritarian and top down, emerge through more-thanhumans' belongings, knowledges, and decision making that come about through relationships. As Yandaarra, we are attempting to do the work of re-weaving and remembering on different levels, on different scales, and through multiple formats. Our collective is collaborating with natural resource management organisations, particularly with the Jaliigirr Biodiversity Alliance and Bellinger Landcare, to shift environmental practice so that it might transform from a technocratic and humandominated approach (humans acting to save a passive environment) to one that might nurture regenerative sovereignties of Juungambala. Such an approach recognises that learning/being/doing are all part of each other and seeks to better understand the ways that more-thanhuman agreement making can act a vital precondition for diverse belongings, and for caring as Country.Together, we are putting this work into practice through bush regeneration and tree plantings, flora and fauna surveys, gathering bush tucker and sacred medicinal plants, art, story, dance, and song that are led by Gumbaynggirr Law/Lore and agreement making. We ask what agreements are needed within this work, how relationships are nourished through it, and what multidirectional sovereignties are negotiated.Learning from a Gumbaynggirr-led understanding of COVID-19 as one manifestation of Baalijin and relationships fallen out of balance re-situates the pandemic in wider and longer histories of colonisation and destructive patterns of existence and broken agreements. In Australia at this time, in ways laid bare in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, 2 there is a widely recognised need to deepen understandings of the multiple, more-than-human belongings and sovereignties that make up this continent. The Uluru Statement has called on Australians to understand sovereignty as a spiritual notion underpinned by deep ancestral relationships between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with their Countries. Indeed, addressing the calls in the Uluru Statement requires change on multiple levels from Constitutional and legal reform to attending to the ways in which all Australians live their diverse belongings and attachments in everyday life. In such ways, Juungambala is partly about responding to COVID-19 but also is about the longer and ongoing destruction of colonisation. Juungambala is what we are doing and sharing, a re-membering of living agreements made between the multiple agencies, beings, and belongings of Country; listening, learning, and respecting more-than-human kin, acknowledging the agreements that have been broken, and seeking to mend them. It also means that Aboriginal peoples' sovereignties and rights to self-determination are attended to, as we work towards the return of stolen lands and lives, in ways that honour agreements ignored and broken. And there must be consequences for breaking these agreements. As we move off the gut-string bridge and try to bring things into balance, on Gumbaynggirr Country, we need to think through and enact processes of decolonisation, Juungambala.Baalijin eventually turns himself into stone. He is forever holding this Law/Lore, the Law/Lore of questioning and shaking things up. In the story, the Law has been broken, and huge changes are happening. We cannot lapse into feeling the guilt, fear, and sadness; and we cannot allow things to continue the same with the same colonising processes. The way we look after Country and each other needs to come from relationships with it, from the way we care as Country guided by the Old Fellas and custodial Law/Lore. Baalijin brings waves and frightens the people but he also brings in Gurruuja, the whale, the creature who was meant to bring fear but who instead helped guide the way with love. The way forward is with Law/Lore, with the songs and dances and stories that emerge from a rearranged landscape of COVID-19, destruction and creation. And so, our sharing with you of Baalijin and the destructive and creative energies he calls in is proper Law/Lore in and of Country; it is sacred and binding.Gumbaynggirr Country holds stories about when agreements are broken and how to respond to the changes that happen. Colonisation has led to many broken agreements, led to much destruction. Now we must find a meeting place, a way to come together as Gumbaynggirr and non-Gumbaynggirr, human and more-than-human, to create healing, to live respectfully. We need to do this together. Gumbaynggirr stories hold Law/Lore. The story of the Koala Brothers, Dunggiirr, and the role of Baalijin, the eastern quoll, holds this agreement and shows the way. Let Baalijin and COVID-19 be the wake-up call that forces the change Country (and we) need. If we can get our act together, we can stop so much destruction. This needs to happen on all levels, at the personal, community, institutional, and structural . This is a way to walk this story together, in integrity with the Dreaming, in oneness.The research for the project was supported by a linkage grant from the Australian Research Council.

b8ea57cc9548a3bd01d157740c85aab395a57eb1,COVID-19: a test of evidence-based surgery,"We read with great interest the correspondence from Agrawal and Sharma 1 , which highlighted the paucity of evidence behind many of the fears during the COVID-19 pandemic.It concerned us that, when exposed to the unprecedented stressor of COVID-19, much of the guidance to the surgical community reverted to traditional eminence-based medicine rather than using high-quality scientific evidence. This has resulted in differing advice for key issues, and created considerable uncertainty.In April 2020 we combined findings from rapid reviews of the literature with the clinical acumen of an expert working group to produce evidence-based guidance for three debated topics: intraoperative practice for laparoscopic versus open surgery, personal protective equipment, and surgical triage. We believe it is telling that despite a 'tsunami of publications' 1 since then, our ongoing monitoring of the literature has resulted in none of the initial recommendations requiring revision. Review of the existing scientific evidence and the small number of high-quality studies relating to COVID-19 were sufficient for us to outline measured precautions tailored to the theoretical risks of SARS-CoV-2.We believe that the widespread adoption of an evidence-based approach provides the best chance of achieving a consensus across the surgical community during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical activity should be modified only when there is adequate justification, and precautionary measures need to be tailored and controlled. The answer to challenging questions for surgical practice should first be sought from inspection of published data, and then from the opinion of experts. As COVID-19 continues to spread, we cannot know what lies ahead, but we can be guided by scientific truth that is already known.",Australia,first author,2020-12-31,12
8b53dc70ed1e1a51f122e48e010ac76974d795d6,"TITLE Active vaccine safety surveillance via a scalable, integrated system in Australian pharmacies. AUTHOR INFORMATION Corresponding Author","AEFIs reported after pharmacist immunisations compared to non-pharmacy immunisations, with no difference in older adults, suggests different cohorts attend pharmacy and nonpharmacy immunisers. The integrated pharmacy system is rapidly scalable across Australia with global potential.What is already known?• Many countries use post-licensure surveillance systems to monitor vaccine safety after a vaccine has been released onto the market.• Passive surveillance systems operate in most countries but are limited by underand/or biased reporting, and delayed detection of safety signals.• Active surveillance systems have been reported for different sectors in Australia, the United States and Canada but there are no pharmacy-based active surveillance systems world-wide, and there is little evidence of rates of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) in pharmacy.• We successfully linked two established platforms: an active vaccine safety surveillance system that integrates with national surveillance networks in Australia, with a cloud-based pharmacy immunisation-record system to develop an automated active vaccine safety surveillance system for pharmacies.• Through active surveillance of 101,440 influenza immunisations between March and October, 2020 (6,992 from pharmacies, and 94,448 from non-pharmacy sites), fewer pharmacy participants reported any AEFI compared to non-pharmacy participants.• Pharmacists are safe immunisers who may capture patients not seen in general practice or other clinics.• This study provides a proven infrastructure of crucial importance to maintain public safety, to promote confidence in vaccine safety, and to assist with COVID-19 vaccine uptake in a safe manner.The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and resulting COVID-19 pandemic has created health and economic crises of unprecedented proportions. Ultimately, only a safe and effective vaccine can mitigate the severe, disruptive consequences of COVID-19. At the time of writing, more than 200 vaccine candidates are under accelerated development -more than 50 of them under clinical evaluation (phase I, II or III human trials). [1] Multiple vaccines are expected to be approved under individual government licensure rules and made available equitably through various initiatives including the COVAX Facility. [2] However, the unique and urgent need to deploy COVID-19 vaccines must be balanced against rapid vaccine development and limited safety data. [3] [4] [5] Adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) can compromise public safety, undermine patient and immuniser confidence in any vaccine, and trigger markedly reduced rates of immunisation. [6] In context, vaccine safety surveillance extends beyond essential pharmacovigilance: it is critical to the deployment and continued uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as to ongoing success of existing immunisation programs.Passive surveillance is the cornerstone of vaccine pharmacovigilance but relies on selfreporting of AEFIs by patients and healthcare professionals, and is limited by under-and/or biased reporting, and delayed detection of safety signals. [7, 8] Active surveillance, by contrast, directly contacts patients after immunisation and can capture adverse event data from large numbers of vaccinees in near-real time. [9] Direct, participant-centred technological approaches, in particular those that are automated and integrated with larger networked systems, [8, 10, 11] offer broad scope and immediate promise for COVID-19 vaccine surveillance.[12] This relationship facilitates sharing of Australia's AEFI data with national agencies such as the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS) and the Therapeutic Goods Administration, [13] and with international agencies, notably the World Health Organization. [13] Pharmacists have an established role in provision of influenza and other vaccines, [14, 15] and in Australia, are also authorised to immunise patients in locations outside pharmacies (such as aged care facilities or schools). [16, 17] Pharmacists have been identified as potential immunisers in COVID-19 vaccination policies, [18] [19] [20] yet, globally, there are no reported active surveillance systems operating in pharmacies. Given the important role pharmacists will play in COVID-19 immunisation, and their accessibility across cities, towns and remote regions, a broad-scale active surveillance system, with agility to adapt as new vaccines are approved, and capacity to operate across a range of geographical settings should be implemented. A system that is automated and linked directly to pharmacy software offers a simple, fail-safe option for surveillance, with little impact on pharmacist workload.MedAdvisor ® is a global, cloud-based, automated application for Pharmacy,[21] used widely in Australia. The MedAdvisor PlusOne ® platform is used by pharmacists to record immunisation encounters, and automatically reports immunisations to the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR).We conducted a prospective cohort study of participants receiving immunisations from pharmacist and non-pharmacist providers in Western Australia between March and October 2020. Participants were consecutive individuals who self-selected to receive an influenza Australia. [22] Site and pharmacist immuniser consent were obtained prior to enrolling each pharmacy into the study. All pharmacists were experienced in using the MedAdvisor PlusOne ® platform. Training on the SmartVax system and the study was provided to all pharmacists prior to data collection. All pharmacies received printed material to inform participants of the study consent process, with an explanatory poster for display in the immunisation consulting room.Non-pharmacy sites (including general practice, university, community and local government clinics) participating in active surveillance through SmartVax have been previously described. [8, 23] SmartVax was used to actively monitor and record AEFIs between March and October 2020.SmartVax sent a series of automated SMS text messages to all participants three to five days after immunisation, to enquire if any AEFIs had been experienced. 'Yes' responders received a second SMS to enquire whether medical attendance had been sought, followed by a third SMS with a link to a short survey to identify the nature, duration and severity of all reactions ( Figure 1 ). People who responded 'No' did not receive a second or third SMS.We also performed an audit of the integrated pharmacy system to determine the number of immunisation encounters recorded in the MedAdvisor PlusOne ® program that were 1) captured in the batch process, 2) made available for SmartVax surveillance, and 3) ultimately underwent surveillance.Research Ethics Committee (RA/4/20/5907).The primary outcome of interest was any adverse event following immunisation (AEFI).Summary statistics for each immunisation location were provided and comparisons between pharmacy and non-pharmacy immunisations were made using the independent samples t-test (or Mann-Whitney test for non-normal data) for continuous variables, and chi-square tests for categorical variables. A comparison of participants reporting adverse events following influenza immunisation was made in unadjusted analysis using a chi-square test. Logistic regression was used to assess differences in proportions of adverse events between participants immunised in pharmacies and participants immunised at non-pharmacy sites, adjusting for confounders of age, sex, and influenza vaccine brand in a multivariable model.We conducted a sub-group analysis of participants 65 years and over. Only complete records (age, sex and vaccine brand) were included in the analyses. The significance level was set at 0.05.All statistical analyses were conducted using R [version 3.5.3; The R Foundation forThe unadjusted proportion of any adverse event differed significantly between participants immunised at pharmacies and those immunised elsewhere. Of those immunised at pharmacies, 4.8% (n=247) reported an adverse event, compared with 6.0% (n=4,356) for those immunised at non-pharmacy sites (unadjusted odds ratio = 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.91; p=0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, and vaccine brand, participants immunised at pharmacies reported fewer adverse events, compared to participants immunised in non-pharmacy sites (odds ratio (OR)=0.87, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.76 to 0.99, p=0.039).Participants reporting any adverse event were sent a second SMS asking if they visited a doctor, medical centre, after-hours service, or hospital emergency department as a result of their vaccination reaction. We excluded 646 (0.8%) encounters from this analysis, as they did not respond to the second SMS.Of participants immunised at pharmacies, 0.1% (n=4) reported seeking medical care following an adverse event compared with 0.3% (n=182) of participants immunised at nonpharmacy sites (p=0.021). After adjusting for age, sex, and vaccine brand, participants immunised at pharmacies reported less adverse events for which medical attendance was sought, compared to participants immunised at non-pharmacy sites (OR=0.35, 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.97, p=0.042).Of participants aged 65 years and over, 5.8% (n=31) immunised at pharmacies reported any adverse event compared with 6.0% (n=1617) for those immunised at non-pharmacy sites (OR= 0.97, 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.40; p=0.875). After adjusting for age, sex and vaccine brand, participants immunised at pharmacies reported similar proportions of any adverse events when compared to participants immunised at non-pharmacy sites (OR=0.94, 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.35, p=0.725). No participants 65 years and over who were immunised at pharmacies reported seeking medical care following an adverse event, compared with 0.3% (n=72) of participants immunised at non-pharmacy sites.Of 11,008 immunisations given in the pharmacies, 10.0% (n=1106) chose not to participate in surveillance, and 71.0% (n=7821) were captured in the API batch process. Of these, 95.6% (n=7475) were available for SmartVax surveillance, and 92.4% (n=7230) were sent SMS1.Complete records for SMS1 (age, sex, vaccine brand) n=6992Records entered late a n=64 Invalid mobile number/SMS failed n=24 Active surveillance systems, particularly those that integrate new technologies with current vaccine surveillance systems, [3, 25] will be vital to maintain public health and confidence, in what may be the world's biggest immunisation program in history: global immunisation against COVID-19. This study is the first in the world to implement and evaluate active surveillance of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) in pharmacies. Through integration of established active vaccine surveillance and cloud-based pharmacy software systems, we developed a robust, rapidly scalable, automated, user-friendly, large scale AEFI monitoring system.Finally, suitably trained hospital-based pharmacists may also contribute via immunisation of health care workers and others in hospitals. Approximately 10% of participants in this study chose not to participate in active surveillance and did not receive SMS1. This may have been a feature of not wishing to participate in a research project, rather than wishing to avoid monitoring, and is expected to be different in the rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine. It is also important to note causality assessment as per the WHO criteria is an essential component of any vaccine safety surveillance program. [39] This is not achievable using our integrated system (only a temporal association is observed), nor is it intended: the purpose is to provide near-real time surveillance, with a known denominator, so that early vaccine safety signals can be identified. Causality assessments are within the scope of the wider network, including AusVaxSafety and the NCIRS.A key strength of this study was our examination of data flow, to ensure all immunisation records transferred in the integrated pharmacy system. To the best of our knowledge this is the only audit of data flow in an active surveillance system.

93918fe15c8edb3345edccdc2009d4a42d633715,Global pathways to sustainable development to 2030 and beyond,"Progress to-date towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1 , which embody the shared aspirations of humanity to promote societal welfare within the planetary boundaries 8 , has been very limited 9, 10 . With less than 10 years to go, much work is still to be done to reach these ambitious global goals.The global COVID-19 pandemic has also disrupted national social, health, and economic systems, and shortterm recovery efforts will likely dominate the global agenda over the next decade, diverting investment and distracting nations from the longer-term multi-pronged focus required to meet the SDGs. But failing to achieve the global sustainability agenda is not an option, and calls have been made to reset it in light of the pandemic 4, 5 .A recent evaluation of the Convention of Biological Diversity 2020 Aichi targets has shown that none have been fully achieved 11 , which has necessitated rethinking the process, and a new round of revision and targetsetting 12 . To avoid a similar outcome for the SDGs and subsequent loss of momentum in progress towards global sustainability, it is prudent to explore alternate pathways towards increasingly ambitious mediumand long-term goals to enable missed 2030 targets to be met later on, to ensure that earlier achievements are not lost through complacency, and to establish a long-term process of continuous improvement. Here, we use integrated assessment modelling to assess the performance of alternative pathways towards 36 sustainability targets under eight SDGs by 2030 (short-term) and their extensions to 2050 (medium-term) and 2100 (long-term) with increasing levels of ambition. Given current and future socioeconomic and environmental uncertainties, this assessment is timely to illuminate robust options for humanity to achieve global sustainability aspirations over the course of the 21 st century, even if we fail to fully achieve the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda.The scientific community has attempted to inform policy discussion on the SDGs with model-based scenario assessments, but mostly with a focus on specific sectors such as land 13 , food 14, 15 , energy 16, 17 , and biodiversity conservation 18 with a few notable exceptions of global nexus-type assessments such as food-energy-water 19 , land-food 20 , and land-food-biodiversity 21 . The few, more comprehensive, integrated assessments of global sustainability that do exist have either used relatively simple models that do not capture the interactions of complex systems 22 , or have not assessed progress towards explicit targets consistent with the SDGs 23 . This has impeded a comprehensive understanding of progress under the uncertainty of global change and precluded a detailed characterisation of the transformative change needed to reach the sustainability targets, especially over timeframes extending well beyond 2030.We used the Functional Enviro-economic Linkages Integrated neXus (FeliX) model 17 , a global integrated assessment model based on system dynamics 24 , to evaluate how interlinked future drivers might unfold through the nexus of population, education, economy, energy, land, food, biodiversity, and climate systems (Extended Data Figure 1 ). We explored a set of five internally consistent descriptions of future pathways aligned with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios 25,26 which span a range of possibilities from continuation of current trends (business-as-usual) to implementation of very strong sustainability interventions across the economic, education, food, and energy sectors (Extended Data Table 1 and Methods).Our SSP-compliant pathways include 'Green Recovery' representing inclusive socioeconomic and environmental development (SSP1), 'Business As Usual' as the continuation of current global average trajectories (SSP2), 'Fragmented World' characterised by regional rivalry rather than global cooperation (SSP3), a world of high 'Inequality' in human and economic opportunities (SSP4), and 'Fossil-Fuelled Development' with prospering socioeconomic yet unsustainable environmental outlook (SSP5). GreenRecovery and Fragmented World are indicative of an optimistic and pessimistic post-pandemic future. The former represents 'a new world of opportunities' where the world shows solidarity in a long-term, sustainable recovery from COVID-19 and emerges fairer, more inclusive, and more prosperous than before.The latter represents increasingly nationalistic attitudes amplifying perceived threats, failures, and a limited capacity to build resilience for coping with future global shocks. Given the deep uncertainties inherent in the characterisation of these five pathways, we used an exploratory ensemble modelling approach 27,28 (50, Figure 1a ), the world is on track (in >50% of 50,000 realisations) for only 5 out of the 36 moderate targets, mostly related to socioeconomic SDGs. Worse, the world is stagnating or even regressing compared to the 2015 state of the world (in >80% of 50,000 realisations) for more than twothirds of the 36 moderate targets, mostly related to environmental SDGs.To illustrate, for the 2030 moderate targets, quality education (SDG 4), economic growth (SDG 8), and health and wellbeing (SDG 3) have a progress of 85%, 78%, and 59%, respectively ( Sustainable food (SDG 2) and clean energy (SDG 7) are the two goals with slower progress of 46% and 28% respectively ( Figure 2 ). In SDG 2, Fossil-Fuelled Development outperforms other pathways by 74% progress with on track or improving trends towards six out of seven moderate 2030 targets on food production and agricultural productivity (Figure 1a ). On the other hand, Fragmented World's progress is only 36%, being on track in achieving only two food-related targets by 2030. For SDG 7, the sustainable economic development in Green Recovery leads to progress of 47% towards targets, mostly due to achieving economic growth with a higher adoption of efficient end-use technologies and a faster transition to renewable energy (Extended Data Figure 4c -i). However, Fossil-Fuelled Development and Fragmented World have the slowest progress and are on track in only one targets for clean energy (respectively) due to heavy reliance on fossil energy (oil, gas, and then coal) production throughout the century (Supplementary   Figure 6e -v, f-v, g-v).Inadequate progress by 2030 can be even worse with ≤0%, 5%, and 1% progress in biodiversity conservation (SDG 15), responsible production (SDG 11), and climate action (SDG 13), respectively. Projected progress in almost all 13 targets under these SDGs are either stagnating or deteriorating across the five modelled pathways by 2030. Poor environmental performance in all pathways except Green Recovery is largely the result of increasing demand for food production 31 , high meat consumption, and a growing energy-intensive economy which poses risks for environmental targets such as agricultural land expansion and intensive nitrogen fertiliser use (Extended Data Figure 4 ). The lowest achievements on these targets also translate into major consequences for ecosystem loss such as rapid decline in forest lands (in all pathways, 100% of realisations) and for destructive climate impacts such as faster global temperature increase (in all pathways, 99% of realisations), as raised in previous studies 21,32,33 (Figure 1a ). In each plot, the three bars indicate progress towards 2030, 2050, and 2100 targets. The bar indicates progress towards the moderate target and the error bar is the variation between progress towards ambitious (error bar bottom) and weak (error bar top) targets in across 50,000 simulated realisations of all future pathways combined. The annotated percentages are average progress across all pathways combined (grey text), the progress in the pathway with the worst performance (red text), and the progress in the pathway with the best performance (blue text), all percentages towards moderate targets by 2030, 2050, and 2100. The pie charts show the share of simulated realisations per each pathway (P1: Green Recovery, P2: Business As Usual, P3: Fragmented World, P4: Inequality, P5: Fossil-Fuelled Development). The pie chart colours show different progress levels (green: on track, yellow: improving, orange: stagnating, red: wrong direction) towards the moderate targets by 2100.Overall, although individual target achievement varies between pathways and is sensitive to the uncertainty across different world realisations (Methods), the current UN agenda for sustainable development remains largely unmet by 2030, even in the most optimistic pathways (e.g., Green Recovery). This reflects tensions between socioeconomic and environmental goals 20,34 which lead to failure in concurrently achieving the 2030 targets.Exploring pathways to reaching 2050 and 2100 targets. The short timeframe can have a complex effect on slow progress towards and tensions between the SDGs by 2030, and there is a higher chance of achieving more ambitious targets by 2050 and 2100. Looking at progress over the century (Figures 1 and 2 Figure 5b -i to b-iii; c-i to c-iii), but also with promising improvements to the major energy, climate, and ecological targets by 2050 and 2100. The Green Recovery pathway performs very well in the medium-term, with 42%, 54%, and 74% progress in biodiversity conservation, responsible production, and climate action by 2050, respectively ( Figure 2 ). This means being on track or improving for 9 out of 13 targets by 2050 (compared to only one improving target by 2030) even with a higher level of target ambition (Figure 1a ).With a longer timeframe and even more ambitious targets, Green Recovery's progress in biodiversity conservation, responsible production, and climate action will become greater by 2100 (90%, 94%, and 84% respectively), being on track or improving on 12 out 13 targets (Figure 1a) . The cumulative effect of interventions (e.g., low carbon energy system, healthy diet with reduced meat consumption) incorporated in the Green Recovery pathway creates these promising long-term trajectories towards targets, which is central to turning the 'tide of change' 7 post-2030 to higher achievements. Priorities for transformative change in a new post-2030 agenda. Humanity is at a crossroads in planning for a post-pandemic world. Our projections of progress towards the SDGs showed that the 2030 agenda faces significant challenges limiting the chances of near-term success. Based on this evidence, we call for extending the current UN Agenda 2030's timeframe, with increasing levels of ambition in targets over the course of the century. This maintains the imperative for and global focus on sustainable development 5 over the long-term with a more radical approach 18,21 that disrupts the status quo, accelerates actions for achieving the SDGs, and puts a safety net in place where achieving ambitious long-term sustainability aspirations are not threatened by a failure to achieve some short-term goals. We showed (in Figures 1 and 2 ) that the Green Recovery pathway, over the medium-to long-term, can be a way forward for realising co-benefits between multiple goals 36 . As a step towards developing a more effective approach, we characterise the major transformative change needed across multiple sectors by analysing the distance to be bridged from current business-as-usual trajectories to the trajectories of a Green Recovery in a post-2030 timeframe (Figure 3 and Methods).Compared to 2050 and 2100 business-as-usual, a Green Recovery primarily requires slowing population growth by 5% and 26%, along with a modest yet sustainable economic growth of 32% and 52%, and improving access to education by 10% and 40%, respectively. The demographic transition to a lower but more highly educated and prosperous population can lead to poverty reduction and gender equality. Higher educational levels also correlate with social norms and people's beliefs in the adoption of bolder actions such as improved family planning 37 , consuming less meat 15 and the appropriate attribution of extreme events to climate change 38,39 to lower population, avoid further deforestation, and reduce GHG emissions, respectively. Concurrently achieving these long-term targets and goals strongly relies on harnessing synergies and minimising trade-offs through steady progress across key parameters such as education level.These socioeconomic changes, however, need to be further supported by transformations in the current consumption and production practices in energy, land, and food systems to mitigate some of the currently alarming trends of emissions and increasing temperature 16, 40 . Our energy systems need to be decarbonised more rapidly compared to business-as-usual trajectories with a decline of at least 36% and 80% in fossil energy (i.e., coal, oil, gas) production by 2050 and 2100, respectively. This also needs to be coupled with changing the patterns of energy consumption through a transition to 13% and 32% lower energy intensity services (compared to the business-as-usual) by mid and end of the century.Cropland and pasture land need to be reduced by 7% and 10% compared to business-as-usual by 2050 and 2100 while continuing to increase food production. This requires improvement in crops and livestock yields and reducing food waste along with strong regulations on land-use change to limit deforestation and reverse the currently alarming trends of biodiversity loss 21 . These changes in the land sector should be facilitated by and intertwined with collaborative actions on food choices 15 through 39% and 50% reduction in landbased animal (i.e., meat and dairy) caloric intake in a healthy diet and a drop of 49% and 67% in livestock production by 2050 and 2100, respectively (compared to business-as-usual). This can also help those worst affected by the distributional impacts on food supply chains in a post-pandemic world.While realising such transformative changes may come across as wishful thinking given current trends and the myriad of technical and political challenges that beset it, a pathway to Green Recovery is not totally out of reach. There are currently promising endeavours across several key sectors that could pave the way for transition to Green Recovery. Universal education is projected to be nearly achieved in many developed and developing countries, with supporting measures such as eliminating school fees and improving local access to schools to ensure equality 41 . In energy sector, there is already diverse global support for reducing energy intensity through digitalisation to transform energy efficiency and increase its value 42 . Reduction in energy demand in various countries is also complemented by policies such as carbon pricing for GHG emissions to accelerate the decarbonisation process 17, 40 . Coordinated efforts in food and land sectors have also emerged to promote healthy diet and sustainable agriculture through strategies such as investment in public health information and intensifying food production of high-quality outcomes 33,43 .The global community needs to take additional steps to capitalise on these efforts in revising and extending the SDGs as an internationally agreed framework that works at the global, national, and local scale 44 and that can unite all sectors and countries behind a resilient economy and build coherent policies for a healthy planet. A Green Recovery pathway can create a touchpoint for science and policy discussions about resetting the global sustainability agenda of the 21 st century in the light of sustainable futures that is central for recovering from the pandemic with a better future for people and planet.Leclère, D. et al. Bending the curve of terrestrial biodiversity needs an integrated strategy. Nature, doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2705-y (2020).Randers FeliX is a system dynamics model that simulates complex interactions amongst ten sectors: population, education, economy, energy, water, land, food and diet change, carbon cycle, climate, and biodiversity. The Note that we aligned our pathways only with these five specific SSP-RCP combinations. We acknowledge that there were other potential combinations assessed in other studies 50 that we did not investigate here. For example in Green Recovery, we aligned the pathway with SSP1-RCP2.6 as the most common level of radiative forcing for SSP1 across 715 SSP-related studies 50 . However, Green Recovery could be also constructed inline with the pathways of more aggressive actions (e.g., EU, China, or the US pledges to comply with the Paris agreement) or more extreme mitigation (e.g., RCP1.9 or pathways proposed by the IPCC 1.5 51 ). This could make Green Recovery attain higher environmental achievements (e.g., faster reduction of fossil energy supply and emissions) compared to our study.To construct the pathway narratives under the five SSP-RCP combinations, we elaborated on the qualitative assumptions of the original SSP storylines 25 and their sectoral extensions 26,52-55 . We also made assumptions describing the policy environment in both the near and long-term for climate mitigation to meet radiative forcing levels associated with each SSP. We made assumptions with respect to mitigating emissions from fossil fuels, bioenergy, and land via, for example, implementing carbon capture and storage for fossil fuels and bioenergy (BECCS) and imposing carbon price on fossil fuels. There was one set of policy assumptions associated with each pathway narrative, consistent with its inherent challenges for mitigation as outlined in To quantify the socioeconomic and environmental trends of each pathway narrative, we needed to identify those model parameters (i.e., pathway drivers) that are key in the projection of these trends. To identify pathway drivers from an initial list of 114 model parameters (as potential drivers) (Supplementary Table 2 60 , we adopted Morris elementary effects method and sensitivity index μ* 61,62 due to its ability to efficiently and effectively screen and identify benign parameters (i.e., factor fixing) from a large number of inputs in complex models 62, 63 . To compute μ*, we used the SALib library 64 implementation through the EMA workbench 65 Table 1 and Supplementary Table   4 ). The selected influential parameters were our pathway drivers which were annotated in Supplementary Subject to:Where , , and denote socioeconomic drivers (related to population, economy, and education), the index of the driver, and the variation space of drivers for calibration, respectively. The SDG framework includes 17 goals and 231 unique indicators to measure progress towards 169 targets.Here we explain how we operationalised the SDGs in FeliX via selecting and modelling a subset of indicators, setting science-based targets on the selected indicators, and measuring progress towards targets at the indicator and goal level (Extended Data Figure 3 ).Commission (UNSC) 72 and other sources (e.g., OECD 73 , WHO 74 , FAO 75 , World Bank 76 ) based on three criteria. First, we looked at the global relevance of the potential output indicators generated by FeliX for measuring SDG progress (SDG applicability). Second, we assessed the ability of FeliX to quantify the SDG indicator (model fidelity). For those indicators that were not present in FeliX, we chose proxies. For example, we did not include an official indicator for biodiversity conservation such as the Red List Index as the required data is not produced in FeliX. Instead, we presented mean species abundance as a proxy indicator for biodiversity 21 . Third, we ensured that the selected indicators are amenable to the specification of quantitative performance thresholds for measuring progress towards the SDGs (target relevancy). We did not include the indicators that FeliX could project such as 'male or female population' which could not be meaningfully interpreted in terms of progress towards the SDGs. All indicators from the global SDG indicator framework 72 that passed these three criteria were implemented in the model (Extended Data Figure   3 )Supplementary Equations 1 to 36.The successful evaluation of progress towards the SDGs required a science-driven characterisation of targets 77 and a quantification of progress that can guide effective policy-making 32 . We defined nine different targets for each indicator using a mixed method approach to acknowledge the uncertainty around each target and the high sensitivity of SDG assessment to target specification. First, we set three target levels across the selected indicators: weak, moderate, and ambitious. At each level, we also set three time-bound targets to measure the progress by 2030, 2050, and 2100. We defined the ambitious target level across these target years following a decision tree 3,78 (Extended Data Figure 3 ).First, we used available quantitative thresholds that were explicitly reflected in the official SDG framework (SDG absolute threshold) to set targets (3 indicators Third, wherever the SDG absolute threshold and technical optimum were not applicable, we followed the 2030 agenda's principle of ""leave no one behind"" and set the targets based on the average state of the top performing countries in a base year using historical documented data (5 indicators). Here, the global average as calculated by FeliX is expected to reach the levels of current top performing countries. In selecting the top performing countries, we removed the outliers from the list to reduce bias in our calculation. For example, a small country with limited agricultural arable land can have very low levels of fertilizer application. Therefore, the inclusion of this country as a top performer in calculating the target for the 'food and agriculture phosphorous balance' indicator can be misleading for larger countries with larger contribution to global food production. Where performance data was not available at the country level, we used regional data (e.g., OECD, continents).Fourth, in the absence of any relevant targets, we nominally set a proportional improvement target in the indicator value from the world average in a base year guided by historical data (global improvement) (1 indicator). For example, 'total CO 2 emissions from agriculture' is an indicator with no absolute threshold mentioned in the original SDGs or technical optimum in other studies. The value of this indicator is also sensitive to the size of a country's agricultural sector. Therefore, leaving no one behind and the average of the top performers did not lead to a meaningful target. In this case, we used a level of global improvement as a target for the indicator. The base year for improvement can vary between indicators depending on the availability of data. The decision about the improvement rate from the base year value was made on a caseby-case basis for each indicator in a range between 5% improvement (e.g., in reducing CO 2 emissions from land-use) to 50% improvement (e.g., reducing coal production) from the global average as the 2030 ambitious target. The reduction or increase percentage was also informed by other model-based projections of SSPs to set an improvement rate ambitious enough to surpass the current trends while still being achievable.For the moderate and weak target levels (across all three target years), we assumed that the moderate and weak indicate 50% and 25% progress towards the ambitious target from the base year value in 2015 with the exception of indicators for which moderate and weak targets were already available in the literature (e.g., radiative forcing from CO 2 emissions). Extended Data Table 2 Where ′ is the SDG and is the number of modelled indicators under goal . The index and its methodology were adopted from a similar index used in the global monitoring of the SDG progress 3 . We used the arithmetic mean with a normative assumption of equal weight across each goal's indicators to align with the global efforts to treat all indicators equally and only prioritise indicators when progress is lagging.This also assumes that there is unlikely to be a consensus on SDG indicator priorities 78 . Based on the normalised values at the indicator level and aggregated indices at the goal level, we measured world progress towards targets at four levels. On track indicates that progress highly likely to achieve (or exceed) global sustainability targets (i.e., indicator and goal level target achievement ≥100%). Improving indicates positive trends towards the goal and indicator level targets but meeting them is unlikely, so challenges remain (i.e., target achievement between 50 and 100%). Stagnating indicates performance following current trends, little chance of target achievement, and significant challenges remain (i.e., target achievement between 0 and 50%). Wrong direction indicates a deteriorating trend (i.e., target achievement between ≤0%).We evaluated the five pathways in terms of the modelled indicators and progress towards the SDG targets through exploratory ensemble modelling 28, 86 we identified the most promising pathway (i.e., Green Recovery) in the 21 st century. We then characterised this identified pathway across multiple sectors (e.g., population, education, decarbonisation, food) andquantified the steps to be taken from the business-as-usual trajectories to realise the identified pathway ( Figure 3 ).Results are available at https://github.com/enayatmoallemi/ Moallemi_et_al_SDG_SSP_Assessment. Extended Data Table 1 . Descriptions of modelled pathway drivers in FeliX. In the first column, pathway drivers (e.g., population growth) are categorised into socioeconomic, energy and climate, land, and food and diet change in relation to their impacts on different SDGs. Each pathway driver is associated with a number of model parameters in FeliX. The fraction value in front each pathway driver in the first column shows the number of influential model parameters (that were identified through sensitivity analysis) to the total number of parameters modelled in FeliX. For example, we modelled 'economic growth' through five uncertain parameters two of which were identified as influential to be included in the quantification of pathways. From the second to the sixth column, the triangles qualitatively represent the direction and magnitude of change in the calibrated pathway drivers. The signs  represents a strong increase,  increase,  no change from business-as-usual,  is decrease, and  is strong decrease. The last column shows the effect of each driver on the related SDGs. 'P' and 'D' indicate that the increasing driver has pressurising (i.e., creating barriers) and depressurising (i.e., facilitating) effects on related SDGs respectively.

The box shows the interquartile range (centre line is median) of these simulated realisations while the whiskers extend to show the rest of the distribution, except for points that are identified as outliers. The coloured lines mark weak, moderate, and ambitious targets in 2100 (Extended Data Table 2 ). The red and blue (discrete) colour gradients specify the percentage that the pathway's performance is deteriorating or improving from the state of the world in 2015. They also show the progress direction and can be used to understand how ambitious the target levels are in comparison the 2015 state of the world.

845f1188404074aa5acbc78974ca0deef1aa8137,Critical observations on and suggested ways forward for healthcare communication during COVID-19: pEACH position paper,"The urgency to address the COVID-19 pandemic has affected healthcare communication at clinical, institutional, and governmental levels. It has done so in various ways, with problems addressed through both structural and ad hoc solutions. Policies have had to be developed at a fast pace and have necessarily relied on adjacent evidence due to the initial lack of specific research and the unprecedented urgency for guidance at many different levels on a global scale. These approaches are understandable and were the best available option at the time.The official top-down (i.e. government instructions) approach that has been prevalent in many parts of the world has shaped communication with the public, raising a number of challenges that have implications both for those seeking care and those who provide it. Communication in healthcare impacts [1] and has been impacted by the pandemic [2] . Understanding this relationship and its relevance to policy and practice during the pandemic and beyond is essential to the improvement of communication in healthcare. A number of communication areas have been identified by the Policy and Practice subcommittee of the International Association for Communication in Healthcare (pEACH) as relevant to policy and professional practice. In this paper we provide a critical reflection on these challenges and discuss approaches that could potentially mitigate them, inform policy and practice, and improve healthcare communication as a whole during pandemics. The topics are divided into two sections: communicating with the public (e.g. uncertainty, risk communication) and communication between healthcare providers and patients, families, and carers (e.g. telehealth, bereavement). We conclude this position paper with a summary of pEACH's position, as well as a set of recommendations for consideration by policymakers, healthcare providers, and experts in healthcare communication.Uncertainty is a major challenge in communication about the COVID-19 pandemic due to the novel and rapidly evolving nature of the disease and situation [2] . Research and healthcare are constantly confronted with uncertainty: new hypotheses and constantly emerging new evidence undermine previous certainties and clinical and public health decision-makers often deal with unknown aspects. Patients often face uncertainty during their disease trajectory [3] , and healthcare providers and researchers are faced with the challenge of communicating this uncertainty.For healthcare providers, scientists, political leaders, and policy makers, all of whom bring specific perspectives and different responsibilities, handling uncertainty in communication with the public and media is an ongoing challenge, and one which has been highlighted at a global level during the COVID-19 pandemic [4] . The uncertainty associated with the pandemic, and the associated public response, has been heightened as a result of the extended duration of the emergency and its socio-economic impact [2] .In general, levels of health literacy in communities suggest that understanding of the concept of risk is likely to be poor, and contribute to a sense of uncertainty and confusion [5] . We know that risk is composed of a materially measurable element of the probability of an event, as well as a socially constructed element of how that probability/event is perceived by the individual and society [6, 7] . The perception of risk in sociocultural context (i.e. a constructionist approach) [7] can be largely diverse in terms of language and culture [8] . Modes of communication (e.g. automated website messages, text messages to provide test results) can further exacerbate public uncertainty and anxiety and have been found to be prone to error and contradiction [9, 10] .Finset et al. [2] emphasise the importance of: honesty during times of uncertainty; being transparent with the public about what is and is not known and the rapid development of new knowledge; the use of clear and consistent language; where possible, by consistent spokespeople who can demonstrate honesty; and confidence in making decisions while demonstrating empathy and concern [11] . In line with Finset et al., we argue that the process of communicating uncertainty would benefit from a multidisciplinary approach involving both laypeople and experts [2] . Both the conceptual approach to communicating uncertainty, as well as the process of communication should include strategies that allow for regular evaluation and optimisation of the communication process and its effectiveness.Existing evidence-based strategies used in healthcare communication, including gathering patients' information needs, involving patients in defining key messages, checking understanding, and using brief, clear and tailored messages [12] , should be further invested in to respond to public health crises.When public health emergencies occur, risk communication [13] from authorities to the public is essential in order for the latter to be informed and to be able to act in ways that promote their safety and health [14] . In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, key messages about wearing masks, washing hands and maintaining social distances are essential to help combat the pandemic [15] . However, the success of institutional risk communication during COVID-19 promoted by healthcare authorities is severely challenged by the current ""infodemic"". The term ""infodemic"", used by the World Health Organisation, refers to an excessive amount of information about a problem that is viewed as being a detriment to its solution [16] .The information can include mis-and disinformation, that is information that is false, inaccurate or expresses the opinion of a single person and cannot be generalised [17] . Misinformation is spread without the intention to mislead, while disinformation is deliberately misleading [18] . These types of information often involve questioning, doubting, and contradicting institutional communication and can lead to a lack of trust in institutions. In response to that, governments need to produce persuasive information that is ""louder"" than the disinformation [19] . They need to build or re-build a trust-based relationship with the public that is based on a transparent and accountable dialogue in order to avoid mistrusting attitudes, non-adherence, reactance and conspiracy attitudes among members of the general population [20] .To support improved communication with the public, future research and policy work should include an evidence-based typology of what mis-and disinformation is, as well as strategies to enhance critical health literacy skills in the population by sustaining critical reasoning competences and psychological awareness about one's own processes of information interpretation. Increased empowerment of health institutions and governments to monitor, evaluate and respond to disinformation that hinders the adoption of appropriate precautionary and safety measures to fight a pandemic is essential. Furthermore, developing risk communication strategies based on scientific evidence from the fields of psychological, behavioural and social sciences, by means of interdisciplinary work across these fields, may improve effectiveness and help overcome psychological barriers that can have a strong bearing on the behavioural response of the public [1].Risk communication campaigns during COVID-19 failed to account for the needs of linguistically and culturally diverse groups of citizens in many parts of the world, especially at the beginning of the pandemic. This is because risk communication campaigns seem to have relied mostly on a realist approach [7] , where risk is seen as an objective that is independent of social context. What seems to have been overlooked in risk communication campaigns during COVID-19 is that the way we think about health is deeply cultural and that the language we use in our communication shapes our own and others' perception of health [21] . The way we apply precautionary and safety measures is largely dependent on our ability to understand information in a language we understand within a cultural framework we can relate to. Failing to do so can have negative implications for our own health and safety, as well as for those of others, by delaying the containment of the pandemic and contributing to the loss of many lives. During the COVID-19 pandemic there has been worldwide media coverage of diverse groups of people (e.g. deaf people, linguistic, cultural and ethnic minorities) not having been informed correctly or in a timely manner [22] or in a language that they could understand [23] , resulting in excess deaths from the virus [24] . Governments of countries with diverse populations have been criticised for developing risk communication campaigns in specific language (s) disregarding linguistic and cultural diversity [25] . When translations of official information were provided, they were not updated in a timely fashion and were often of poor quality [26] . All of the above raise questions about representation, inclusion and inequalities in access to care and the right to health.Risk communication campaigns require a constructionist approach [7] , multidisciplinary communication practices, early consultation and continuous engagement with stakeholders from linguistically and culturally diverse communities, as well as builtin evaluation strategies.During the pandemic, promoting citizens' motivation and adherence to non-pharmaceutical preventive behavioural recommendationssuch as physical distancing, wearing a mask, and practicing frequent hand hygienehas been one of the most challenging tasks for health communicators.A long tradition of scientific research in psychology and behavioural sciences has demonstrated how previous and, often not completely conscious, health beliefs, attitudes, values and social pressure may hinder such change of individuals' health conduct [27] . The ability to regulate emotions reflects variation in how well people adjust emotional responses to meet health behaviour change demands [28, 29] . Equipped with this ability, individuals can aptly modify which emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and express them in order to reach the expected desirable health behaviour [30] . Emotional regulation, in its turn, is affected by psychosocial variables related to people beliefs about health and care, and the social influence related to health behaviours. Therefore, sustaining citizens' engagement in health prevention requires not only information strategies, but also initiatives aimed at supporting individuals' emotional regulation processes which enable a positive adaptation to the stress generated by the uncertainty of the emergency situation [31] .In order to become more motivated to change behaviours and to adhere to prescribed preventive measures, citizens need to feel part of a joint endeavour with scientists and health authorities. New ways of collaborating among citizens and between communities and healthcare experts, such as citizens science initiatives, are a priority to sustain healthcare systems' ability to effectively react to a health emergency. This requires the promotion not only of a more accountable, inclusive and participatory dialogue with the community but also listening and deep understanding of citizens' worries, concerns, unmet needs, and expectations for an actual engagement in health promotion and disease prevention [32, 33] .The World Health Organization (WHO) took six weeks to officially name COVID-19, with much of the media and public settling on the generic virus name 'coronavirus' in the interim [34] . This is in contrast to the names of previous epidemics and pandemics, which frequently received a toponym (place name), such as MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), West African Ebola Virus, and, the last pandemic of a similar magnitude, the Spanish Influenza. Toponyms for diseases are generally misleading and stigmatising [35, 36] . This is because the place named is not necessarily the real place of the origin of the pandemic, and the connection of a place and its people with a disease is inappropriate.The delay in naming by the WHO opened up the possibility that similar toponymic conventions would be applied by the media and general public, resulting in the vilification of people who appear to be from China, particularly in the earlier months of the pandemic [37] . However, despite deliberate efforts by some commentators and politicians around the world to use names like ""Wuhan-virus"", toponyms for COVID-19 have not been widely used.Choosing not to enshrine the (possible) place of origin of a global pandemic is one way of resisting a racist narrative. With increasing representation and diversity in the media and in public life in general, there is more of this resistance, which aids in countering the small (albeit loud) minority that attempts to push their racist agenda, in part, through disease-naming [38] . This highlights the necessity of diversity and representation within health care and research, as well as the importance of participating in deconstructing inequitable systems and ensuring a radically inclusive approach to all aspects of care. It is insufficient to be ""nice"", we need to be actively resisting racist narratives through our language and our actions.Telehealth, which encompasses the provision of healthcare remotely by using telecommunication technologies, such as video and web-based applications [39] , has been touted to improve health outcomes and reduce costs [40] . Prior to and during the pandemic, three discernible telehealth trends emerged: greater availability and convenience; more focus on the management of chronic conditions; and a shift of telehealth from clinical settings to the home via the use of mobile devices [41] . Telehealth has provided an attractive and well-suited option for healthcare service delivery during the pandemic. These healthcare services included primary care, urgent consultations, chronic disease management, mental health counseling, mild to moderate COVID-19 support and follow up, as well as provider training [42, 43] .While there have undoubtedly been benefits in the broader adoption of telehealth, ensuring that utilisation is optimised requires building patient and provider skills as well as and systems-level changes. Patients need instructions on using telecommunication technologies, skills to handle patient-provider interactions, and directions on following up remotely. Healthcare providers need training on setting joint agendas remotely, handling efficient patient-provider interactions, and assessing patient comprehension. They also need to recognise the limitations of the telehealth format for new patients and mental health delivery [44] . On a systems level, successful telehealth requires convenient, fast and secure internet connections, user-friendly telehealth platforms, and affordable cost structures [45] [46] [47] .The reliance on telehealth to improve access to care during the pandemic has paradoxically exacerbated the health disparities due to race and socioeconomic status that already exist [48] [49] [50] . More research about how to address these disparities is needed. In contrast to the recommendation of 'social distancing' advocated by public health officials, the delivery of healthcare necessitates 'physical distancing with social connectedness' [51] . The pandemic provides us with an opportunity to evaluate if and how telehealth can achieve this goal during this challenging time and beyond, particularly with respect to the user experience and the outcomes of telehealth.The pandemic has led to extraordinary circumstances of deaths that have been challenging for both the families of the deceased and the staff within the healthcare system [52] ; families could not be by the side of their dying relative, and healthcare providers comforted their dying patients. Deaths have sometimes been fast and unexpected, without the possibility of a traditional funeral and many families mourned multiple deaths at the same time. Because of these reasons, family members are at risk of complicated grief [53] , and other psychological morbidities [54] . Healthcare providers are trained in bad news delivery but may need support in caring for mourning families because of the current complex circumstances. They are at risk of being overburdened by the quantity and quality (e.g. loneliness) of the deaths they have attended and, because of this, may also experience increased negative feelings, such as sadness, guilt or stress [55] .One response to the needs of family members would be the provision of psychological services via telehealth to support the mourning process and prevent further psychological distress. Such services consist of phone-call conversations where psychologists offer family members the opportunity to express their grief and loss-related emotions during social distancing and quarantine restrictions, allowing for the creation of alternative death rituals, as well as providing reassurance to the family members that their loved ones were supported and comforted by the healthcare providers during their time of death. The services would also allow for referral for further psychological support as needed. This type of initiative has been successfully trialed in Italy [56] and other places have likely tried similar approaches. Psychological services for healthcare providers would also be beneficial. These interventions, however, rely on organisational support that invests in providing access to care appropriate to the needs of patients and their families. Such an approach also necessitates flexibility within the healthcare system in order to be responsive and timely to the needs of patients and families in the community.With the pandemic, masked clinician-patient communication in face-to-face settings is the new norm [57, 58] . However, there is speculation that masks may impede effective communication by impacting both verbal (e.g. reducing or changing tone or volume of voice by masks) and non-verbal aspects, since listeners cannot see speakers' facial reactions and lip movements. As is well established, excellent clinician-patient relationships are dependent on effective communication and it has been generally believed that speech perception and understanding is improved if auditory input (verbal) is accompanied with visual input (non-verbal). Unfortunately, routinely used surgical masks block visual access to the verbal (mouth) and nonverbal (facial) cues.Masks may not cause much problem for the general population but can be problematic for those with hearing impairment. In a recent study of healthcare providers, most participants reported that the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) did not interfere with patient care nor did providers report any inconvenience [59] . One study has shown that the presence of a surgical mask, did not have a detrimental effect on speech understanding in either the normal-hearing or hearing-impaired groups [60] . This was confirmed in another study showing that masks did not impact the speech perception or clarity for listeners with normal hearing, even when the environment was noisy [61] . That study did show improved speech perception performance in noise for only listeners with hearing impairment when visual input is provided using a transparent surgical mask [61] . Facilitating equitable access to care, which includes effective communication, through the development and provision of transparent masks to hearing-impaired groups in a noisy environment is vital.To build confidence in communicating with masks, policies could be devised to share evidence about effective communication, while speech and language therapists can provide specific training in variations in pitch, loudness, tempo, and rhythm to enhance clarity through the mask [62] . Continued investigation into the implications of communicating with masks during the pandemic along with an examination of adjacent evidence into communicating with face coverings and other mask-wearing will be important for developing such guidance.Patient empowerment means that a patient has (a sense of) control over their healthcare and health [63] . When a person becomes ill, they also become dependent and can lose autonomy, which can lead to frustration, anger and could make them more unwell. In many countries during the outbreak, continuity of care was disrupted for people with chronic health conditions. A hospital suddenly became a place which should be avoided. The fear and risk of infection, together with government guidelines, encouraged people to lock themselves up in mini-bubbles, which again cut some patients off from care [64] : informal carers may have had to stay at home, psychological help often had to be provided over the telephone, and, in some places, physical therapy was suspended. Those who were already vulnerable due to illness or some other cause, may have felt even more fragile. Many experienced feelings of loneliness that highlighted their dependence on their loved ones and caregivers even more deeply [65] . Some family members were not allowed to be at the bedside of dying patients who were experiencing the most painful form of disempowerment (see section 3.2). Uncertainty and the feeling of risk and seriousness, as noted above, are also characteristics of COVID-19 and can increase the aforementioned feeling of dependence in patients. Learning lessons from the pandemic and preparing for the future should not be led solely by governments, politicians, and experts, but any actions taken in order to prevent and combat healthcare crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, should actively involve citizens, patient associations, and individual patients to better understand the implications of all of these aspects on individuals and their interactions with the healthcare system. Evidence shows that improving the level of patients' empowerment and their engagement in healthcare is a protective factor in the COVID-19 emergency [66] .The COVID-19 pandemic has both impacted upon and been impacted by healthcare communication. From behaviour change [67] to bereavement, we have witnessed an upheaval of healthcare practice and the development of policy on-the-run. To ensure that policy and practice are evidence-based, person-centred, more inclusive and equitable, we advocate for critical reflection on this symbiotic relationship between COVID-19 and the central role of communication in healthcare. This can be achieved through investment in pandemic-specific research to inform the development of communication strategies, relevant and responsive training and policies, and supporting the translation of research to practice.When considering communication with the public, the policy and practice priorities should be developed using social scientific evidence including listening to and working with diverse groups of citizens to improve their participation, engagement and, by extension, health literacy. For policymakers, we advise connecting with experts who are engaged in research and strive to implement the latest evidence, to help in this way build systemic approaches to improving communication during pandemics and similar healthcare crises. The credibility of messages and the way they are conveyed can make the difference between widespread community adherence to guidance and deliberate non-adherence as a form of political protest [68] . Focusing on enhancing linguistically and culturally tailored health literacy to improve public knowledge of evidence-based medicine and scientific methods, as well as ways to recognise accurate information, are also priorities.During the pandemic, healthcare providers have needed to rely on a limited evidence to make changes to their practice and these changes will necessitate critical reflection once time allows. For healthcare providers, we advise connecting with policymakers and experts to share experiences and concerns, which will help improve both the system and practice. The use of critical reflection tools and social scientific methods to evaluate current practices will make a positive impact on interpersonal communication and facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration.For communication experts in research and education we need to advocate for policy and research agendas. This translates to i) improving our work in sharing our research beyond our own fields, ii) including both patients and healthcare providers in the development, implementation, and evaluation of interventions so that the intervention is a product of co-creation with a wide range of stakeholders, iii) connecting with policymakers and governments beyond requesting and reporting on funding, iv) regularly updating teaching materials so that they are in line with the latest evidence, and v) promoting open-access and datasharing whenever possible.In this paper we have reflected on the implications of uncertainty and risk communication, the lack of pandemic-specific evidence, and the mutual influence communication and the pandemic have on each other. While pandemics are not new, we are living through an unprecedented time as communication is being transmitted through an array of channels. We now have the ability to examine healthcare communication in a pandemic through multiple social scientific lenses, thus strengthening our ability to respond to this ongoing crisis and any other that might arise in the future. We have also articulated specific areas for further research. Against our critical reflections we emphasise the need for evidence-based guidance on healthcare communication during pandemics. We propose that the evidence is generated from multidisciplinary research which is more inclusive and diverse and conducted in consultation with the public from inception to implementation. Funded research and implementation of policies should come with integral built-in evaluation strategies that aim to improve the communication and overall experience of those seeking and providing healthcare services during pandemics.As more evidence is being generated, we call for practices and policies developed as interim solutions in response to the pandemic, as well as long-established practices and policies on communication in healthcare to be revisited as we collectively reflect on how healthcare communication has evolved during COVID-19. It is vital that we learn from the challenges faced to improve not only responsiveness to public health crises, but also to improve communication in healthcare beyond the current pandemic [69] . This requires flexibility, reflexivity (i.e. attending systematically to the context of constructing knowledge), and continual modifications at all levels. Setting policies in stone and not reflecting on how practices evolve may introduce unintended consequences and new challenges and can perpetuate inequalities in care as we move forward.",Australia,first author,2020-12-26,12
38b48358f954d47a2d0347442f2258aed21cd415,Genomic epidemiology reveals transmission patterns and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Aotearoa New Zealand,"N ew Zealand is one of a handful of countries that aimed to eliminate coronavirus disease . The disease was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11 March 2020. The causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 1 , was first identified and reported in China in late December 2019, and is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans, likely arising through zoonotic transmission from wildlife 2 . Because of its relatively high case fatality rate [3] [4] [5] , and virus transmission from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals 6, 7 , SARS-CoV-2 presents a significant public health challenge. Due to its high rate of transmission, morbidity and mortality, SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in world-wide lockdowns, economic collapses and led to healthcare systems being overrun.Since the publication of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome on 10 January 2020 8 , there has been a substantial global effort to contribute and share genomic data to inform local and international communities about key aspects of the pandemic and use these data to complement traditional approaches to infectious disease control 9 . Analyses of genomic data have played an important role in tracking the epidemiology and evolution of the virus, often doing so in real time 10 , and leading to a greater understanding of COVID-19 outbreaks globally [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Ultimately, these data may help reveal the impact of differing disease control strategies, from strong population lockdowns such as that used in New Zealand, to countries like Sweden that limited the sizes of social gatherings and implemented distance learning for some school students, but which did not impose a strict lockdown.New Zealand reported its first case on 26 February 2020 and within a month implemented a stringent, country-wide lockdown of all non-essential services. To investigate the origins, time-scale and duration of virus introductions into New Zealand, the extent and pattern of viral spread across the country, and to quantify the effectiveness of intervention measures, we generated whole-genome sequences from 56% of all documented SARS-CoV-2 cases from New Zealand and combined these with detailed epidemiological data.Between 26 of February and 1 July 2020, there were a total of 1178 laboratory-confirmed cases and a further 350 probable cases of SARS-CoV-2 in New Zealand. A 'probable case' means a person who has been classified as such by the medical officer of health based on exposure history and clinical symptoms, and who has either returned a negative laboratory result or could not be tested. Of these combined laboratory-confirmed and probable cases, 55% were female and 45% were male, with the highest proportion of cases in the 20-29 age group (Table 1) . Many cases were linked to overseas travel (37%). Geographic locations in New Zealand with the highest number of reported cases did not necessarily reflect the human population size or density in that region, with the highest incidence reported in the Southern District Health Board (DHB) region rather than in highly populated cities (Fig. 1) . The number of laboratory-confirmed cases peaked on 26 March 2020, the day after New Zealand instigated an Alert Level 4 lockdown-the most stringent level, ceasing all non-essential services and stipulating that the entire population self-isolate ( Fig. 1 ; see ref. 16 for a summary of New Zealand's COVID-19 alert levels). From 23 May 2020, New Zealand experienced 25 consecutive days with no new reported cases until 16 June, when new infections, linked to overseas travel, were diagnosed. All subsequent new cases have been from patients in managed quarantine facilities.We sequenced a total of 649 virus genomes from samples taken between 26 February (first reported case) and 22 May 2020 (the last confirmed case that was not associated with managed quarantine facilities during the sampling time period). This represented 56% of all New Zealand's confirmed cases. The data generated originated from the 20 DHBs from across New Zealand. DHBs submitted between 0.1 and 81% of their positive samples to the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR), Wellington, for sequencing. Despite this disparity, a strong nationwide spatial representation was achieved ( Fig. 1) .Notably, the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 sequences sampled in New Zealand represented nearly all of the genomic diversity present in the global viral population, with nine second-level A and B lineages from a proposed global SARS-CoV-2 genomic nomenclature 17 identified. This high degree of genomic diversity was observed throughout the country (Fig. 2) . The SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled in New Zealand comprised 24% aspartic acid (S D614 ) and 73% glycine (S G614 ) at residue 614 in the spike protein ( Fig. 2) . Preliminary studies suggest that the D614G mutation can enhance viral infectivity in cell culture 18 and phylodynamic approaches have shown an increase in growth and size of lineages with this mutation 19 . Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the increase in glycine in New Zealand samples is due to multiple importation events of this variant rather than selection for this mutation within New Zealand. We also inferred a weak yet significant temporal signal in the data, reflecting the low mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with findings reported elsewhere (Fig. 2) .Despite the small size of the New Zealand outbreak, there were 277 separate introductions of the virus out of the 649 cases considered. Of these, we estimated that 24% (95% CI: 23-30) led to only one other secondary case (i.e. singleton) while just 19% (95% CI: [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] of these introduced cases led to ongoing transmission, forming a transmission lineage (i.e. onward transmission to more than one individual; Fig. 3 ). The remainder (57%) did not lead to a transmission event. New Zealand transmission lineages most often originated in North America, rather than in Asia where the virus first emerged, likely reflecting the high prevalence of the virus in North America during the sampling period. By examining the time of the most recent common ancestor, or TMRCA, of the samples, we found no evidence that the virus was circulating in New Zealand before the first reported case on 26 February. Finally, we found that detection was more efficient (i.e. fewer cases were missed) later in the epidemic in that the detection lag (the duration of time from the first inferred transmission event to the first detected case) declined with the age of transmission lineages (as measured by the time between the present and the TMRCA; Fig. 3 ).The largest clusters in New Zealand were often associated with social gatherings such as weddings, hospitality and conferences 20 . The largest cluster identified during the sampling time, which comprised lineage B.1.26, most likely originated in the USA according to epidemiological data, and significant local transmission in New Zealand was probably initiated by a super spreading event at a wedding in Southern DHB (geographically the most southern DHB) prior to lockdown. Examining the rate of transmission of this cluster enables us to quantify the effectiveness of the lockdown. Its effective reproductive number, R e , decreased over time from 7 at the beginning of the outbreak (95% credible interval, CI: 3.7-10.7) to 0.2 (95% CI: 0.1-0.4) by the end of March (Fig. 4) . The sampling proportion of this cluster, a key parameter of the model, had a mean of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.4-1), suggesting sequencing captured the majority of cases in this outbreak. In addition, analysis of genomic data has linked five additional cases to this cluster that were not identified in the initial epidemiological investigation, highlighting the added value of genomic analysis. This cluster, seeded by a single-super spreading event that resulted in New Zealand's largest chain of transmission, illustrates the link between micro-scale transmission to nationwide spread (Fig. 4) .The marked decrease in R e of this large cluster coupled with the relatively low number of virus introductions that resulted in a transmission lineage suggests that implementing a strict and early lockdown in New Zealand rapidly reduced multiple chains of virus transmission. As New Zealand continues its goal to eliminate COVID-19 community transmission, but with positive cases still detected amongst individuals quarantined at the border reflecting high virus incidence in other localities, it is imperative that ongoing genomic surveillance is an integral part of the national response to monitor any re-emergence of the virus, particularly when border restrictions might eventually be eased.Ethics statement. Nasopharyngeal samples testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were obtained from public health medical diagnostics laboratories located throughout New Zealand. All samples were de-identified before receipt by the researchers. Under contract for the Ministry of Health, ESR has the approval to conduct genomic sequencing for surveillance of notifiable diseases.Genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2. A total of 733 laboratory-confirmed samples of SARS-CoV-2 were received by ESR for whole-genome sequencing. Viral extracts were prepared from respiratory tract samples where SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR using WHO-recommended primers and probes targeting the E and N gene. Extracted RNA from SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were subject to whole-genome sequencing following the ARTIC network protocol (V1 and V3) and the New South Wales (NSW) primer set 15 .Briefly, three different tiling amplicon designs were used to amplify viral cDNA prepared with SuperScript IV. Sequence libraries were then constructed using Illumina Nextera XT for the NSW primer set or the Oxford Nanopore ligation sequencing kit for the ARTIC protocol. Libraries were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq chemistry or R9.4.1 MinION flow cells, respectively. Near-complete (>90% recovered) viral genomes were subsequently assembled through reference mapping. Steps included in the pipeline are described in detail online (https:// github.com/ESR-NZ/NZ_SARS-CoV-2_genomics).The reads generated with Nanopore sequencing using ARTIC primer sets (V1 and V3) were mapped and assembled using the ARTIC bioinformatics medaka pipeline (v 1.1.0) 21 . For the NSW primer set, raw reads were quality and adapter trimmed using trimmomatic (v 0.36) 22 . Trimmed paired reads were mapped to a reference using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool 23 . Primer sequences were masked using iVar (v 1.2) 24 . Duplicated reads were marked using Picard (v 2.10.10) 25 and not used for SNP calling or depth calculation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called using bcftools mpileup (v 1.9) 26 . SNPs were quality trimmed using vcflib (v 1.0.0) 27 requiring 20× depth and overall quality of 30. Positions that were <20× were masked to N in the final consensus genome. Positions with an alternative allele frequency between 20 to 79% were also masked to N.

Ambiguous sites that have been flagged as potential sequencing errors were masked 31 . A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was estimated using IQ-TREE (v 1.6.8) 32 , utilising the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY + Γ) 33 nucleotide substitution model with a gamma-distributed rate variation among sites (the best fit model was determined by ModelFinder 34 ), and branch support assessment using the ultrafast bootstrap method 35 . We regressed root-to-tip genetic divergence against sampling dates to investigate the evolutionary tempo of our SARS-CoV-2 samples using TempEst (v 1.5.3) 36 . Lineages were assigned according to the proposed nomenclature 17 using pangolin (https://github.com/hCoV-2019/pangolin). To depict virus evolution in time, we used Least Squares Dating (v 1.8) 37 to estimate a time-scaled phylogenetic tree using the day of sampling.With the full set of New Zealand sequences, we used a time-aware coalescent Bayesian exponential growth model available in BEAST (v 1.10.4) 38 . The HKY + Γ model of nucleotide substitution was again used along with a strict molecular clock. Because the data did not display a strong temporal signal, we used an informative prior reflecting recent estimates for the substitution rate of SARS-CoV-2 39 . The clock rate had a Γ prior distribution as a prior with a mean of 0.8 × 10 -3 subs/site/year and standard deviation of 5 × 10 -4 (parameterised using the shape and rate of the Γ distribution). Parameters were estimated using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, with 2 × 108 steps-long chains, sampling every 1 × 105 steps and removing the initial 10% as burn-in. Sufficient sampling was assessed using Tracer (v 1.7.1) 40 , by verifying that every parameter had effective sampling sizes above 200. Virus sequences were annotated as 'imported' (including country of origin) or 'locally acquired', according to epidemiological data provided by EpiSurv 28 . From a set of 1000 posterior trees, we estimated the number of statistics using NELSI 41 . We determined the number of introductions of the virus into New Zealand as well as the changing number of local transmission lineages through time, with the latter defined as two or more New Zealand SARS-CoV-2 cases that descend from a shared introduction event of the virus into New Zealand 42 . Importation events that led to only a single case rather than a transmission lineage are referred to as 'singletons'. For each transmission lineage and singleton, we inferred the TMRCA.To estimate R e through time, we analysed New Zealand sequences from the clade identified to be associated with a wedding. We used a Bayesian birth-death skyline model using BEAST (v 2.5) 43 , estimating R e for two time-intervals, as determined by the model, and with the same parameter settings as above. We assumed an infectious period of 10 days, which is consistent with global epidemiological estimates 44 . Reporting summary.

5d67d4851d4dccc1e81431329a95c81d35474061,The impact of a national COVID-19 lockdown on acute coronary syndrome hospitalisations in New Zealand (ANZACS-QI 55)-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ),"Evidence before this study A significant reduction in hospitalisations for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported in several countries. It has not been possible to identify potential contributing factors for the observed reductions in ACS presentations on the basis of limited patient demographic, clinical characteristic, management and outcome data reported to date. Current reports have come from countries with a relatively high incidence of COVID-19 cases (e.g. Italy, Spain, England, USA) and it is not known whether similar findings have occurred in countries with a low incidence of COVID- 19 .Added value of this study Our study reports nationwide data during the COVID-19 lockdown in New Zealand, from established registries of inpatients with confirmed ACS, and patients with suspected ACS in out-of-hospital settings. There was a 28% reduction in ACS hospitalisations observed, with a 34% reduction in hospitalisations for non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS) and no significant change in hospitalisations for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). There were no observed differences in clinical characteristics of patients hospitalised, in particular there was no suggestion that they were presenting later with more severe disease as evidenced by similar GRACE scores and in-hospital mortality. Door-to-balloon times were similar, and length of hospital stays were shorter, suggesting that the ability to care for patients with ACS inhospital was preserved. There was no reduction in ambulance attendances for suspected ACS suggesting that failure to seek medical attention was not the only contributing factor to the reduction in ACS hospitalisations. An 11% reduction in ambulance attendances for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests supports a possible true decline in the incidence of ACS during the lockdown. A 54% decrease in community troponin testing suggests changes in the delivery of primary healthcare during lockdown, which may have led to less referrals for hospitalisation.Implications of all available evidence Reductions in ACS presentations to hospital have been observed in countries with both a high and low incidence of COVID-19 related pathology. The reasons for these findings are likely multifactorial and cannot be solely explained by patient failure to seek medical attention, or healthcare systems inability to provide routine care for ACS patients due to prioritisation of services towards COVID-19 pathology. These findings are important for healthcare delivery planning and public health policy in any future pandemic.Lockdowns, a form of enforced social distancing, have been successfully implemented to limit the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in several countries [ 1 , 2 ] and have led to the elimination of community transmission in New Zealand (NZ) [3] . During the NZ nationwide lockdown, implemented on the 23 March 2020, individuals were instructed to stay at home other than for essential personal movement, and all non-essential businesses and facilities were closed for 5 weeks. By the end of the lockdown on the 27 April 2020, there had been 1122 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases (233 per million population) and 19 deaths (3 • 9 deaths per million population). In comparison, on the same date, there were 166 and 354 deaths per million population in the United States and United Kingdom respectively [4] . Hospital occupancy with COVID-19 cases in NZ was extremely low, with no more than 20 patients in hospital or 5 in an intensive care unit at any time throughout the country (Supplementary Material, Figure S1 ). The NZ national lockdown was successful in eliminating COVID-19 from NZ for ~120 days, when there was further limited community spread after COVID-19 was reintroduced following international travellers.While lockdowns slow the progression of a pandemic, they can have undesired effects. A significant decrease in hospitalisations for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was observed in many regions around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . The inability of overwhelmed healthcare systems to deliver routine care to patients with ACS may partially explain this reduction [13] . In addition, individual behaviour may change during a lockdown, in particular, a reluctance to seek medical attention for non-COVID-19 conditions due to a fear of contracting COVID-19 at healthcare facilities. The relative contributions of the pandemic itself and the lockdowns to the decline in ACS hospitalisation are unknown.New Zealand, an island nation of 5 million people, is in a unique position to study the impact of lockdown measures on patients presenting with ACS, largely without the confounding effects of COVID-19 pathology. We evaluated the impact of the national lockdown on the presentation and management of patients with ACS from national and regional registries of hospitalisations for ACS, ambulance attendances for suspected ACS and cardiac arrests, and from community troponin testing, a surrogate measure of primary health care assessment of chest pain.In this study, patient contacts with healthcare systems were investigated during the 5-week national lockdown between 23 March and 26 April 2020.Hospitalisations with ACS were identified from the All New Zealand Acute Coronary Syndrome Quality Improvement (ANZACS-QI) registry. This nationwide web-based electronic database records a mandatory dataset entered by clinicians for all patients hospitalised with ACS and referred for coronary angiography. Data was collected prospectively from all NZ public hospitals and patients are included regardless of whether they are managed in a coronary care unit or ward-based setting. Further details regarding data collection were previously reported [14] . The completeness of patient capture and accuracy of ACS diagnosis was previously validated against national administrative datasets [15] . In this study, patients admitted during the 5-week lockdown were compared with those admitted during a non-lockdown period comprising the same dates in the preceding 5 years (23 March to 26 April 2015-2019). All patients hospitalised for a confirmed ACS that underwent coronary angiography during the study period were included. Analyses were performed on a per-hospitalisation basis, rather than per-person. Registry entries with incomplete data were excluded from analysis -10 hospitalisations (1 • 9%) during the lockdown and 11 hospitalisations (0 • 3%) during the non-lockdown period.Data variables recorded in the ANZACS-QI registry included patient demographics, the Global Registry of ACS (GRACE) admission to six-month score [16] , left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), coronary angiography findings, revascularisation details and inhospital outcomes. Significant coronary artery disease was defined as ≥ 50% stenosis in any major native epicardial vessel or coronary bypass graft. Time from symptom onset to hospital presentation was recorded for those with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Door-to-balloon time was recorded for those treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).Ambulance attendances were captured from the Out-of-Hospital Heart Attack and Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest registries. These two nationwide registries capture all ambulance attendances by the St John Ambulance Service and Wellington Free Ambulance. Data was collected from: computer-aided dispatch data and supporting systems; and on-scene data that was entered into electronic patient report forms by the ambulance personnel in attendance. Ambulance attendances during the 5-week lockdown were compared with those during a 33-week baseline period between 1 July 2019 and 16 February 2020. Data from the first six months of 2019 was not available due to industrial action during that time. Ambulance attendances for any reason, and specifically for suspected ACS and out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) were investigated. Attendances for suspected ACS events were defined as prehospital clinician coding of either cardiac chest pain, myocardial ischemia or STEMI. All ambulance attendances for OHCA were included, regardless of suspected aetiology of arrest or if resuscitation was attempted.The data variables recorded in this registry included patient demographics, location of ambulance attendance, final clinical status (1-immediate threat to life, 2-potential threat to life, 3-unlikely threat to life, 4-no threat to life, 0-dead) and patient disposition. Rural and urban localities were derived from meshblock census area units according to Statistics NZ.In the absence of meshblock data, attendances by the Wellington Free Ambulance were designated as urban.Anonymised community laboratory testing data was obtained from Labtests NZ. Labtests NZ provides funded community laboratory testing for the wider Auckland Region. It serves a population of approximately 1 • 7 million and has testing volumes that represent about 40% of all those performed nationally. The laboratory does not process specimens collected from emergency departments or inpatient services, which are analysed in regional hospital laboratories. As part of pandemic preparations, a number of laboratory testing depots were reduced temporarily by arrangement with the funder, however ample patient access was provided and all biochemistry tests remained available, including urgent requests. For example, troponin requests are automatically processed urgently, and this turnaround did not change during lockdown (average 3 h and 45 min, including transport time).The number of high-sensitivity Troponin I (Siemens TNIH) assays performed each week, and the proportion of results above the upper limit of normal (non-gender specific 99th population percentile 47 ng/L) were assessed during the 5-week lockdown and compared with a 33-week baseline period between 1 July 2019 and 16 February 2020. The performance of other common laboratory tests, including full blood counts, serum creatinine and liver function tests, were also measured. These other tests were performed using Siemens Advia and Sysmex automated laboratory platforms. Labtests is accredited under International Accreditation New Zealand (IANZ), according to the international ISO15189 standard.The ANZACS-QI registry is part of the Vascular Informatics using Epidemiology and Web (VIEW) programme at the University of Auckland. The VIEW programme was approved by the Northern Region Ethics Committee Y in 2003 (AKY/03/12/314) and National Multi-Region Ethics Committee since 2007 (MEC07/19/EXP). The ambulance Out-of-Hospital Heart Attack Registry and the Outof-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Registry studies are approved by New Zealand Health and Disabilities Ethics Committee 19/NTB/186 and 19/NTB/187 respectively. Individual patient consent was not required.Descriptive statistics for categorical variables were reported by frequency and percentage, and Pearson's chi-square was used. Continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviations or median with interquartile range. Comparison of continuous data between groups were tested using Student's t -test or Mann-Whitney U test where appropriate.Mean event rates per week (ACS hospitalisations, ambulance attendances and laboratory testing) were calculated by dividing the number of events by the number of weeks for each time period and were compared with the Mann-Whitney U test. Mean rate ratios were calculated by dividing the mean event rate during the lockdown period by the mean event rate during non-lockdown periods and confidence intervals were calculated by Fieller's method. The analysis did not adjust for potential confounding variables as there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics of patients hospitalised for ACS between time periods, and equivalent weeks in prior years were used as the control period to reduce effects of seasonal variation. All P-values were two tailed and a Pvalue of < 0 • 05 was considered significant. Data was analysed using SAS statistical package, version 9 • 4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)No funders had any role in study design, data collection, data analysis, interpretation and writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study.There was a mean of 105 ± 17 hospitalisations with confirmed ACS per-week during the 5-week lockdown compared to a mean 146 ± 14 hospitalisations per-week in the same time period in 2015-2019 (mean rate ratio 0 • 72, 95% CI 0 • 61 -0 • 83, p = 0 • 003). This decrease was largely explained by a reduction in non-STsegment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) (59 ± 9 vs. 86 ± 10 per-week, mean rate ratio 0 • 69, 95% CI 0 • 59 -0 • 79, p < 0 • 001). Unstable angina presentations also reduced (13 ± 7 vs. 24 ± 5 per-week, mean rate ratio 0 • 54, 95% CI 0 • 29 -0 • 80, p = 0 • 008). However, there was no change in frequency of STEMI presentations during the lockdown period (33 ± 4 vs. 36 ± 7 perweek, p = 0 • 31) ( Fig. 1 -2 ).There were no differences in patient demographics or characteristics observed during the lockdown compared to the nonlockdown period ( Table 1 ) . Median age was 66 years, 70% were male, there was no difference in ethnicity and the mean GRACE score for mortality at 6 months was 3 • 4% in both periods. Coronary angiography and echocardiography findings were also similar. Length of hospital stay was one day shorter during lockdown for both patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) and STEMI ( p < 0 • 001).Of those presenting with STEMI, rates of reperfusion therapy were similar between time periods (79% vs. 78%, p = 0 • 89). A similar proportion of patients received reperfusion with fibrinolytic ACS = acute coronary syndrome; CI = confidence interval; hsTroponin = high-sensitivity Troponin; NSTE-ACS = non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome; NSTEMI = non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; STEMI = ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; SD = standard deviation; ULN = upper limit of normal p-value calculated using Mann-Whitney U test Of those presenting with NSTE-ACS, time from hospital admission to coronary angiography was shorter during lockdown (2 • 2 ± 2 • 6 vs. 2 • 9 ± 2 • 6 days, p < 0 • 001). The proportion of patients who were revascularised remained similar although there was an increase in percutaneous coronary intervention (59% vs. 49%, p < 0 • 001) and a corresponding reduction in coronary artery bypass grafting (9% vs 15%, p = 0 • 005).Ambulance attendances for suspected ACS were similar during the lockdown compared to the non-lockdown period (408 ± 58 vs. 420 ± 29 per-week, p = 0 • 44). Total weekly ambulance attendances during the lockdown were reduced by compared to the non-lockdown period (7210 ± 187 vs. 8176 ± 191 per-week, mean rate ratio 0 • 88, 95% CI 0 • 86 -0 • 91, p < 0 • 001). A reduction in ambulance attendances for OHCA was also observed (98 ± 5 vs. 110 ± 12 per-week, mean rate ratio 0 • 89, 95% CI 0 • 84 -0 • 95, p < 0 • 001) ( Fig. 1 , 3 and Supplementary Material, Figure S2-3) .Amongst ambulance attendances for suspected ACS, age (median 69 vs. 68 years), male sex (55% vs. 54%) and ethnicity were similar between the lockdown and non-lockdown periods. There was a 24% increase in attendances at individuals' homes (346 vs. 280 per week), a 59% reduction in attendances to healthcare fa-cilities (34 vs. 8 per week) and a 65% reduction in attendances to individuals in public places (14 per vs. 42 per week). There were slightly fewer attendances for status 1 and 2 presentations representing immediate or potential threat to life (37% vs. 40%) and a small increase in individuals not transferred to hospital for further management (4% vs. 2%) ( Table 2 ) . Similar findings were observed for all ambulance attendances and ambulance attendances for OHCA (Supplementary Material, Table S6-7).There was a decrease in community high-sensitivity troponin I testing performed during the lockdown compared to the nonlockdown period (182 ± 67 vs. 394 ± 72 per-week, mean rate ratio 0 • 46, 95% CI 0 • 31 -0 • 62, p < 0 • 001) ( Fig. 1 and 3 ) . The total number of troponin I tests per-week that were above the upper limit of normal were reduced during lockdown, although the proportion of above the upper limit of normal was similar for the two periods (7 • 7% vs. 7 • 1%, p = 0 • 80). Community testing for other common laboratory tests were also reduced during the lockdown (Supplementary Material, Figure S4 ).This is the first nationwide description of ACS hospitalisations in the context of a strict nationwide COVID-19 lockdown, but in the absence of widespread community transmission and low hospital occupancy with COVID-19 cases. During the 5-week nationwide COVID-19 lockdown period in NZ, there was a decrease in the number of hospital admissions with confirmed ACS, due to a reduction in hospitalisations for NSTEMI and unstable angina, respectively. There was no difference in hospitalisations for STEMI. There were no observed differences in demographics or comorbidities of patients hospitalised for ACS, and no indication that pa-tients were presenting later or with more severe disease during lockdown, with similar door-to-device times, GRACE scores, LVEF, and in-hospital mortality observed. A reduction in total ambulance attendances, ambulance attendances for OHCA and community troponin testing were also observed. This study provides a unique in-a) Ambulance attendances for suspected acute coronary syndrome b) Community troponin I testing sight into the impact of the lockdown and other measures taken to mitigate a major pandemic on nationwide ACS hospitalisations. An increase in ACS presentations was expected during the COVID-19 pandemic, as seen with seasonal influenza epidemics [ 17 , 18 ] , significant public events [19] and natural disasters [20] . However the opposite was observed with reductions in ACS presentations by 25-48% reported from the United States [ 5 , 6 ] , Italy [ 7 , 8 ] , Spain [9] , Austria [10] , England [11] and Germany [12] . The findings of these studies were limited to specific regions or survey responses. On the basis of limited patient demographic, clinical characteristic, management and outcome data reported to date, it is not possible to establish contributing factors for observed reductions in ACS presentations. The aforementioned studies were undertaken in countries with a high burden of COVID-19 cases in comparison to NZ. As a result, the factors underlying the observed reduction in ACS hospitalisations may be different.Patient factors including failure to seek medical attention are likely to contribute to the decrease in ACS hospitalisations during lockdown. In this nationwide study, there were no observed differences in demographics or comorbidities of patients hospitalised for ACS during the lockdown compared to previous years, suggesting factors influencing non-presentation affected all individuals equally. Strong public health messages emphasising the need for social distancing and encouraging people to stay at home dur-ing the lockdown period may have discouraged individuals from seeking medical attention. Individuals may have avoided hospitalisation for fear of contracting COVID-19 in hospital; or separation from family due to stringent visitor restrictions during the lockdown. The reduction in hospitalisations for NSTE-ACS but not for STEMI, suggests that those with less severe symptoms may have avoided presenting to hospital during lockdown. A similar observation of a reduction in NSTEMI and unstable angina hospitalisations but not for STEMI was seen from a single centre study in Germany [12] , where there was a higher community prevalence of COVID-19 but relatively low mortality compared to other countries. A relative increase in ACS hospitalisations, ambulance attendances for suspected ACS and community laboratory testing was observed in the second half of the 5-week lockdown. This coincided with media reports of potential harm arising from non-presentation, changes in messages from the government recommending seeking medical attention for non-COVID-19 conditions and a decline in the detection of new cases of COVID-19.An alternate explanation is that a genuine reduction in the incidence of ACS during the lockdown resulted in fewer hospitalisations for ACS. There are several possible mechanisms for such a reduction. In Oceania, which includes Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity indicators have remained at or below interseasonal levels [21] , possibly as a result of the various hygiene Table 2 Description of ambulance attendances for suspected acute coronary syndrome during the lockdown compared to non-lockdown period. and physical distancing measures implemented to reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission. Numerous associations have been established between influenza and cardiovascular events [ 17 , 18 , 22 ] , and a decrease in influenza may have contributed to the reduction in ACS events observed. Reduction in physical activity due to lockdown restrictions was demonstrated internationally [23] and this may have resulted in individuals experiencing less symptoms and less likelihood of physical stress leading to plaque rupture. We have no information on changes in emotional, financial or mental stresses during lockdown. Environmental factors, such as the reduction in air pollution observed in urban areas during lockdown in NZ [24] and in other countries [25] , may also have influenced health outcomes.The observed reduction in ambulance attendances for OHCA may suggest a decline in the true incidence of ACS in NZ during the lockdown, as coronary artery disease is the predominant cause of OHCA [26] . In contrast, an increase in OHCA has been observed in Italy [27] , New York City [28] and France [29] where individuals with ACS may have experienced adverse outcomes due to being unable to access timely healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the drop in ACS hospitalisations is not a unique finding during the current pandemic. Similar decreases were observed in emergency surgeries for type A aortic dissection in New York [30] , coronary care unit admissions for heart failure and atrial fibrillation [8] and paediatric emergency department visits in Italy [31] .To further examine possible contributing factors for the reduction in ACS hospitalisations, we studied the ambulance attendance and community laboratory data. In contrast to the reduction in ACS hospitalisations observed, there was no change in the ambulance attendances for suspected ACS. It is difficult to identify reasons for this discrepancy with the available data and further research is required. Although there were no differences in patient demographics observed in those attended by ambulance personnel for suspected ACS, these patients during lockdown may have had less severe presentations as their clinical status codes were lower and a lower proportion were transferred to hospital. Previous research demonstrated that half of all patients transported to hos-pital in NZ for suspected ACS did not have a final discharge diagnosis of an ACS [32] . This proportion may have increased during lockdown. Patients may have preferentially called for ambulance assistance during lockdown, rather than self-presenting to hospital or their primary care physician. Another possible reason for the discrepancy may be that less patients with ACS were investigated with coronary angiography, as these patients are not captured routinely within the ANZACS-QI registry. Guidelines for inhospital management of ACS were published during lockdown and supported the consideration of alternative strategies for treating patients with COVID-19 [33] [34] [35] . These included the use of fibrinolytic therapy for STEMI and deferral of coronary angiography for NSTE-ACS without high risk features. Such a change in the investigation and management of patients with ACS is a less likely contributor to the current findings given the low incidence of COVID-19 in NZ. Furthermore, there was no change in demographics or clinical characteristics of ACS patients during lockdown, suggesting no major change in referral for angiography.The reduction in community laboratory testing is indicative of reduced referral for testing from primary care during the lockdown period. This may be due to fewer individuals seeking medical attention with their primary care physician, but there were also important changes to primary care provision during the lockdown period that may influence testing volumes. Virtual consultations were encouraged, requesting of laboratory tests that were unlikely to alter patient management were discouraged and some laboratory testing depots were closed. Access to urgent laboratory tests, including high-sensitivity troponin I, did not change and rapid turnaround times were maintained. The lower ambulance attendance rates from healthcare facilities also suggest lower rates of referral from primary care to hospital during the lockdown.Some changes in in-hospital ACS management were observed during lockdown. The time to diagnostic coronary angiography was reduced in patients presenting with NSTE-ACS. This is likely due to less patients with ACS in hospital and an increase in available catherisation laboratory capacity due to cancellation of elective coronary and structural interventional procedures. Despite re-quiring personal protective equipment for possible COVID-19 cases, there was no increase in door-to-balloon time observed for STEMI presentations, unlike in other reports [8] . More patients received revascularisation by PCI compared to CABG during the lockdown. This may reflect a preference for multi-vessel PCI instead of surgical revascularisation to minimise intensive care unit occupancy and hospital length of stay. As a result, shorter length of hospital stay was observed. There was no effect on in-hospital mortality. The proportion of patients hospitalised with STEMI who did not receive reperfusion or revascularisation is relatively high, although consistent with previously reported national data [36] . The reasons for this are not able to be ascertained from the available ANZACS-QI registry data. Late presentation STEMI, absence of obstructive coronary disease or complex/diffuse coronary disease not amendable to revascularisation may be possible causes.The phenomenon of reduced ACS presentations reported in this and other studies holds important lessons for the management of a ""second wave"" of COVID-19 or another future pandemic. While stringent pandemic management measures were effective, they are likely to have contributed to individuals refraining from accessing healthcare for non-COVID-19 conditions. In the context of ACS, such delays in presentation are associated with worse outcomes [37] including cardiac death, recurrent angina or ACS, heart failure and arrhythmias. With the easing of lockdown restrictions, healthcare systems should plan to accommodate a ""catch-up"" phenomenon related to these possible late presentations with ACS and their sequelae. Further research to carefully evaluate the factors contributing to delayed or non-presentation in patients with ACS are required.To our knowledge, this is the first study using a comprehensive and established national registry to report changes in hospitalisations for ACS during a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown. It is supported by data providing important insights into the prehospital investigation and management of patients with suspected ACS from national ambulance and regional community laboratory registries.A limitation of this study is that it was restricted to patients admitted to hospital with ACS who underwent coronary angiography. As a result, any potential increase in the proportion of those hospitalised for ACS that were managed without an invasive strategy would not have been detected. However, this is unlikely to be a major contributor given the low number of hospital admissions for COVID-19 and current guidelines stressing the importance of maintaining standard care for patients with ACS and without concurrent COVID-19 [33] [34] [35] . This study did not capture patients with an ACS that were not hospitalised during the lockdown period and the causes for non-presentation were not identifiable. In addition, any patients that died in the community due to an ACS prior to medical contact were not recorded in the registries used in this study. The longer-term outcomes of patients with ACS admitted during the lockdown and event-rates following de-escalation of lockdown restrictions were not available for this analysis.Despite the low incidence of COVID-19 in NZ, a decrease in ACS hospitalisations was observed during the 5-week lockdown. A number of factors are likely to have contributed to this finding. For instance, the reduction in hospitalisations for NSTE-ACS and not for STEMI suggests that those with less severe symptoms opted to avoid contact with hospitals. Secondly, the decrease in ambulance attendances for cardiac arrests supports a possible decline in the true incidence of ACS during lockdown. Finally, a change in the delivery of primary healthcare, as suggested by lower community laboratory testing, may have led to less referrals for hospitalisation. This analysis suggests that the increased out-of-hospital mortality observed in regions with a high community burden of COVID-19 [27] [28] [29] may predominantly reflect the direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19, rather than the consequence of the lockdown alone. The findings of this study have important implications for healthcare delivery planning and public health policy in any future pandemic.DZC, RAS, AJK, BD, CVK, TSm, AHS, VFT, MWW, JBS contributed towards the study conception and design.

75861f947902eb63c1528393eb7d78b710f0f4b3,Genomic sequencing effort for SARS-CoV-2 by country during the pandemic,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as a causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 , and its genomic data first became available from China on January 10, 2020. Since then, tremendous efforts have been made to sequence the viral genome from samples collected throughout the world. Genomic data can be utilized for epidemiological investigations at both local and global levels. For example, a study in the Netherlands on a large cluster of COVID-19 cases applied combined conventional and molecular epidemiology analyses using viral genomic data and identified multiple introductions of the virus from a community into healthcare facilities (Sikkema et al., 2020) . Phylogeographic analysis using genomic data has revealed the transmission dynamics of the virus, including from where and when the virus was imported and how it has been spreading (Fauver et al., 2020; Worobey et al., 2020) . Collecting viral sequence data is also important for conducting an evolutionary analysis to infer the origin of the virus (Boni et al., 2020) , detect mutations that may affect the pathogenicity and infectivity of the virus (Korber et al., 2020) , and identify a conserved region to target for future vaccine development (Day et al., 2020) . Such analyses rely both on the viral sequence data collected locally and on the abundance of publicly available sequence data from throughout the world (Hadfield et al., 2018) . Thanks to global solidarity and the trend of ""open data"", genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from many parts of the world are reported, shared, and publicly available. Here, we analyze and report the virus sequencing efforts by country during the pandemic.We obtained data on the number of COVID-19 cases in each country from the World Health Organization website (https:// covid19.who.int/), and we acquired SARS-CoV-2 sequence data along with metadata, such as the reporting country, sample collection date, and data submission date, from the GISAID database (Shu and McCauley, 2017) ; accessed on September 6, 2020. Sequence data longer than 20,000 nucleotides were regarded (near-complete) genomic sequences and included in the further analysis. The quality of sequence data was not considered for the inclusion criteria.Forty-nine countries have published >100 genomic sequences. The UK (38.9%) and the USA (22.7%) accounted for the majority of all published genomic sequences (N = 93,817) ( Figure 1 ). The rate of the number of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences per reported COVID-19 case varied widely among countries. Iceland sequenced the highest proportion of reported cases (up to 30% of all cases). Because epidemiological situations and timelines differ among countries, we analyzed each country's genomic sequencing efforts of SARS-CoV-2 from the perspectives of ""fraction"", ""timeliness"", and ""openness"" at a relatively early stage of the epidemic (Figure 2 ). ""Fraction"" was assessed using the number of viral sequences of samples collected by the time the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases had reached 1000 in each country. The UK, the USA, Australia, and Iceland sequenced more than 50% of the first 1000 cases in each country. ""Timeliness"" was assessed by how many sequences had been published by the time the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases had reached 1000 in each country. Iceland, the Netherlands, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo published more than 100 sequences by the designated time point. Finally, we analyzed ""openness"", noting that it is difficult to assess this point because the quantity of ""unpublic"" data remains unknown. Therefore, we used the time gap between sample collection and sequence data submission as a surrogate to gauge willingness to make data open. There is a caveat that this indicator can also be affected by the sequencing capacity of each country. We calculated the median days of the time gap for the first 100 sequences in each country and found that the Netherlands, the USA, Iceland, and the UK released sequence data within two weeks of sample collection.Overall, the USA, Iceland, the Netherlands, the UK, and Australia showed great performance in the three indicators for sequencing efforts. The number of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences deposited in the GISAID database has been substantially increasing day by day. Sequencing efforts keep improving in many countries, although the present study focused only on the early phase of the epidemic in each country. Another caveat is that we did not check the quality of sequence data such as a Q-score and ambiguous nucleotides. Unfortunately, there are a lot of lowquality sequence data in the database that would affect evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses (De Maio et al., 2020) . That point should be also investigated to evaluate sequencing efforts in the future.Importantly, a lower ranking in Figure 2 does not indicate that those countries exhibited poor performance. Although we listed 49 countries in which more than 100 sequences were deposited in the public database as of September 2020, there are many more Countries are ranked by three indicators describing sequencing efforts. ""Fraction"" is the number of viral sequences of samples collected by the time the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases had reached 1000 in each country. Because samples were collected before disease confirmation and positive samples could be identified retrospectively, the value could be larger than 1000. ""Timeliness"" is the number of sequences that had been published by the time the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases had reached 1000 in each country. ""Openness"" is the time gap (days) between sample collection and sequence data submission for the first 100 sequences in each country. Sequence data for which the collection and submission dates are unknown were excluded from the analysis. Darker colors indicate better performances. countries with high numbers of cases but few, or no, sequence data available. Such missing data would create bias in a phylogeographic analysis to elucidate the global transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. While the cost of sequencing has decreased and mobile sequencing machines have become available in the last few years, genomic sequencing is still technically, logistically, and financially challenging in resource-limited settings. International and domestic collaboration among public health authorities, healthcare facilities, academia, and industries must address these issues.Simultaneously, we observed good performance of sequencing efforts for some low-and middle-income countries including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Brazil, Senegal, India, and Thailand ( Figure 2 ). This finding encourages further strengthening of sequencing capacity at the global level, which can lead to the development of an effective response strategy against not only the current pandemic but also future outbreaks of viral diseases.This study was funded in part by the Leading Initiative for Excellent Young Researchers (grant number 16809810) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan.

d4f3db70c8476e592ec3fe89d955a22898495128,ARTICLE IN PRESS Conducting dermatology clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has demanded prompt response to the conduct of clinical trials. Guidance should be sought from governing health bodies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency, or Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA), in line with local coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) governmental policies. 1 Sponsors should work with principal investigators and site staff to ensure patient safety. We provide practical considerations for conducting clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic.1. Priority: Assessing the risks and benefits of continuing the trial in the existing form, modified form, or discontinuing the trial on patient safety and well-being 2. Participation: Ability of the participant, based on individual patient risk factors and in accordance with the trial protocol, to participate in the trial without compromising the validity or integrity of the trial 3. Capacity: Assessment of resources available for continuing the trial, including site staff, support staff (contract research organization [CRO] and medical moni-T. Sheriff et al.JID: CID [mNS; January 5, 2021; 15:48 ] tors availability), couriers, and equipment and investigational product (IP) supply 2Contingency planning is an ongoing process as new information surrounding the virus surfaces. Institutional Review Board (IRB) guidelines and local COVID-19 guidelines should be followed wherever possible for guidance. Ethics approval is essential if any protocol amendments or additions are made that often requires extensive consultation with study sites before submission to an ethics board.Recruitment of new participants should be minimized to reduce infection risk and transmission unless the trial reduces mortality, improves the prognosis of a debilitating condition (eg, severe inflammatory dermatosis, advanced/high-grade cutaneous malignancy, or autoimmune blistering diseases), or where conventional therapy causes greater harm than the IP. Many sponsors have also paused recruitment of new participants into open label extension (OLE) phases and allowing only existing patients who have shown adequate safety to enroll; furthermore, many public hospital facilities that share clinic areas have closed many trials.The following steps were taken at our private facility with respect to minimizing SARS-CoV-2 infection risk:• Re-educating staff on the importance of regular handwashing and use of hand sanitizer between patients • Increased hygiene measures such as making hand sanitizers and tissues available to patients • Instructing the daily professional cleaner to carry out extra sanitizing measures such as daily disinfecting of all chairs, telephones, door handles, and all other surfaces • Staff sanitizing rooms between patients including spraying the rooms with disinfectant spray and wiping down door handles with alcohol-based sanitizer. • Mandatory wearing of surgical masks for all staff and participants during trial visits • Staggering appointments to reduce the number of patients in the waiting room • Reducing the number of chairs in the waiting room to increase the distance between patients • Allowing patients to bring in their own shorts and singlets or suitable dresses to wear for skin examinations (on-site shorts and singlets are fully laundered after every use) • Instructing patients to reschedule appointments if they have coryzal clinical manifestations or if they have travelled overseas in the past 14 days • Minimizing nonessential personnel on site such as medical students, pharmaceutical company representatives, and additional family members who are not primary careersShould the situation arise that a member of staff is exposed to COVID-19 that staff member should not be allowed on site until a 14-day self-isolation period is completed. If the staff member has tested positive to COVID-19, then that staff member should not be allowed to return to the site until they return two consecutive negative tests and a clearance certificate from a medical practitioner is presented. It is recommended that clinical trial sites adopt a policy of having backup subinvestigators, backup unblinded team members, and a backup study coordinator for all clinical trials, to ensure that the site can remain operational for an extended period without disruption should a member of staff be required to self-isolate.In the case of all staff being exposed and self-isolation is required, the site should inform participants, in particular any exposed participants, and all sponsors and clinical research associates (CRAs) of the situation. All staff should be given the capability to work remotely from home in order for the administrative side of clinical trials to continue. Once the site is cleared to recommence operations, all patients, sponsors, and CRAs should be notified.In the case of a forced lockdown by the government, site should inform patients, sponsors, and CRAs of the situation.As above, all staff should be given the capability to work remotely from home in order for the administrative side of clinical trials to continue. Once the site is cleared to recommence operations all patients, sponsors and CRAs should be notified.Trial participants should be informed promptly of any protocol-related changes. If approved by the sponsor, visits should ideally transition to remote teledermatology visits, particularly for higher-risk individuals. Higher-risk individuals are those above 80 years of age, receiving chemotherapy, having multiple cardiac and respiratory comorbidities, and working in high-risk environments. 3 The advice given to our participants is in line with the Australian government COVID-19 guidelines and the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).The following measures were taken at our facility to ensure participant transparency:• All existing clinical trial participants received a telephone call from the lead subinvestigator of the clinical trial they are participating in. The subinvestigators informed participants that the trial site is still fully operational and able to continue seeing patients for clinical trial visits.• Participants have been informed of the above measures to reassure them that the site has taken precautions to ensure their safety. • Participants have been advised that, if they prefer, subinvestigators can meet them at the staff entrance and then escort them straight into a consultation room so as to minimize their contact with other staff and patients in the building. • If approved by the sponsor, participants in certain studies have been advised of the possibility of remote study visits in conjunction with a pre-approved courier delivering additional supplies of study drug to the patient's home. • Participants have been given the opportunity to ask questions and discuss any concerns they may have regarding their participation in a clinical trial, the study drug, and SARS-CoV-2. 4 All information provided to participants is based on what the site has been provided by sponsors and CRAs. • Every participant was given a study card with emergency contact numbers if they contracting SARS-CoV-2. • All conversations with participants have been documented in the patient's file and in the study source notes.Overall decisions will be guided by participant safety, the ethics approved clinical trial protocol, and the requirements of the sponsor.Teledermatology remote visits are being approved for many trials via privacy-compliant platforms (eg, Microsoft Teams and Zoom). Many dermatologic assessments, such as Severity of Alopecia Tool Score (SALT), Pemphigus Disease Activity Index (PDAI) score, and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), can be performed with high-resolution emailed photographs. Only strictly necessary trial procedures should be conducted remotely. 5 Adverse events and concomitant medications should be recorded as a bare minimum.For clinical trials where remote visits are possible, couriers should be arranged for IP to be mailed to the participant's residence. Courier companies that can maintain patient confidentiality are available. Where IP needs to be administered on site, community nursing services may be employed for IP administration and other essential duties only. Local laboratories may also be used instead of central laboratories to minimize infection risk and prevent shipping/courier delays.During the COVID-19 pandemic measures should be taken to ensure that trial participants are safe and informed, and staff is available at all times. Contingency planning should be conducted in consultation with sponsors to determine continuation, discontinuation, and enrolment of new participants. Several strategies can be implemented to continue dermatology clinical trials, including switching to teledermatology visits, infection control measures, use of local laboratories, and community nursing if possible. The pandemic has also allowed us to reflect on clinical trial processes to better refine them for the future.",Australia,first author,2020-12-16,12
9b1d5f763c929b6d411ff62d7767a7d65571da08,Novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in people with rheumatic disease: epidemiology & outcomes,"Coronaviruses are a large family of ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses with crown-like spikes on their surface that cause diseases in animals and humans. Most of the hundreds of coronaviruses circulate among animals (e.g., cats, pigs, camels and bats) but ""spillover events"" pneumonia, acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), thromboembolic events, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, multi-organ failure, and septic shock 1 . Many of the drugs being studied as potential treatments or preventive medications for COVID-19, such as interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitors, IL-1 inhibitors, anti-tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (anti-TNF), Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine and glucocorticoids 2 , are commonly used to treat rheumatic disease.SARS-CoV-2 has precipitated extensive efforts to clarify the risk of poor outcomes in those with immune system disease, including people with rheumatic disease. Hypothetically, people with (inflammatory) rheumatic disease might have a different COVID-19 phenotype and may be at an increased risk of infection and/or severe COVID-19 for a number of reasons. These include;underlying immune system dysfunction, treatment with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drugs, higher levels of comorbidity (e.g., cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis), and extra-articular manifestations of their rheumatic disease with organ vulnerability or dysfunction (e.g., kidney or lung involvement) 1 .In this article we will review the epidemiology and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic disease. We also discuss data from other immune mediated disease and its relevance to patients with rheumatic disease. In addition, we cover the limitations of the research efforts to date and how the current knowledge translates into practice guidance. Finally, we discuss what we believe the future research agenda should include.The meta-prevalence of COVID-19 in autoimmune disease, including rheumatic disease, was recently estimated in a systematic review and meta-analysis 3 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f While these prevalence data are important and informative, it should be taken into account that the overall quality of evidence was only moderate due to significant study heterogeneity, namely sample size, diseases included, method of collection, diagnostic ascertainment, geographic location, and date of collection. Therefore, these data should be interpreted with caution.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fTo date, most available data on outcomes for people with rheumatic disease infected with SARS-CoV-2 comes from single center or single country case series or from one large international registry; the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance (GRA) physician registry 11, 12 .Case series have considerable limitations, discussed in detail below, however the data warrants consideration in terms of reassurance if outcomes do not appear substantially worse, and in terms of hypothesis generation and directing the focus of ongoing and future research 12 . The data from the GRA registry, given size, multiple sites with global data collection, will be discussed first.The COVID-19 GRA physician registry resulted from a rapid collaborative effort of international rheumatologists with data collection launched on 24th March for the Global registry and on 27thMarch for the European registry 12 . Preliminary data, on the first 110 patients, was published only three weeks later 13 with the analysis of the first 600 patients published two months after launch 14 . The registry allows rheumatology physicians to enter de-identified data about people with rheumatic disease and confirmed or highly probable COVID-19 infection in the global or European registries (to comply with data management regulations). Data includes patient and disease characteristics, comorbidities, rheumatic medications (cs/b/tsDMARDs), diagnosis, treatment and, when possible, outcomes of COVID-19 infection.The case series reported by the GRA included 600 cases from 40 countries, although most were from the USA or European countries, entered between 24th March and 20th April 2020 14 .This series represented people with more severe COVID-19 as nearly half (46%) were hospitalized and 9% (55) died. The cases were mostly female (71%) with median age of 56 years (interquartile range 45-67 years). The commonest rheumatic diseases included RA (38%), The following cohort studies include those with over 50 patients with rheumatic disease and a laboratory confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19 diagnosis.A notable single center study conducted in Spain at the height of the first wave of COVID-19infections in March/April 2020 also provides useful information about risks for hospitalization for COVID-19 in people with rheumatic disease 17 therapies. This is consistent with age as the major risk factor for death in general populations 22 .The meta-analysis described above reporting meta-prevalence, also reported meta-analysis of outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic conditions, including hospitalization and death 3 .01) associated with 5-aminosalicylates/sulfasalazine use 16 . There is biological plausibility for poor outcomes in COVID-19 with sulfasalazine use; in a virtual ligand screening study, sulfasalazine was identified as having high binding affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and papain like protease 24 . Other computational screens have also predicted sulfasalazine as interacting with SARS-CoV-2 25, 26 . Sulfasalazine is used commonly in rheumatoid arthritis and peripheral spondyloarthritis and generally considered a drug with a good infectious side effect profile 27 . Further investigation of these results will be required in other datasets like the C19-GRA registry 28 .The Emerging Infections Network (EIN) conducted a small observational study (n=81) in people with a range of immune mediated diseases from rheumatology, gastroenterology and multisystem diseases like sarcoidosis 29 . No patients on anti-TNF or Janus kinase inhibitors died (0/19, 0%) compared to those on other therapies (9/62, 15%). Initial positive reports on the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f efficacy of baricitinib in treating COVID-19, and reports on the potential of anti-TNF therapy are supported by these findings 30, 31 .A large French study of 1,418 patients on treatments for psoriasis reported no COVID-19deaths. Patients were using oral agents such as cyclosporine and methotrexate, as well as anti-TNF, anti-IL-17 and anti-IL-23 agents. Only 12 patients had PCR confirmed COVID-19 with an additional 54 having probable disease. Five patients were admitted, three of which went to ICU none died 32 .A report of 76 patients with multiple sclerosis from New York with COVID-19 (both PCR confirmed and suspected) had a 24% hospitalisation rate and an 11% death rate. This cohort had 34 patients on B cell depleting agents and 5.8% of those patients died 33 . Although a very small report, a series of six patients on teriflunomide, which is the active metabolite of leflunomide, were reported from Lombardy in Italy. Patients all continued therapy throughout, and none of the patients required hospitalisation or ICU care 34 . The largest series of multiple sclerosis patients (n=347) was from France; 12 patients (3.5%) died and 73 patients (21%) were hospitalised. In multivariate analysis age, co-morbidity and disability status predicted poor COVID-19 outcomes, while there was no increased risk of poor outcomes with immunosuppressant use 35 .The immediate impact of the pandemic meant that efforts to collect case data were urgent 36 .could help address pressing questions. As such, data limitations, particularly bias and confounding are important to consider. Bias can be broadly thought of as information bias, selection bias and confounding. There are also the issues of confounding by indication and channeling bias when examining outcomes associated with drug exposures.Information bias stems from errors in measurement, which is not likely to be a large issue for registry studies. Selection bias however is a major concern when considering voluntary registries. Selection bias arises from the non-random collection of data, such as in case reports and registries are particularly prone to selection bias. In this novel coronavirus pandemic, it is particularly relevant because often those who collect and report outcome data are hospitalbased and therefore, patient outcomes have the potential to be skewed to the more severe outcomes. This is likely evident in the results from the first report of the C19-GRA where 46% of patients were hospitalised and 9% died 14 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fHyper-inflammation seems to be a major contributor to the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19and so there is likely to be an, as yet not clearly defined, role for therapies that suppress the immune system. This has been demonstrated in the outcomes of trial of glucocorticoids 46, 47 .Due to the initial interest in anti-interleukin-6 therapies in the treatment of COVID-19, the ACR guidelines state that these therapies may be continued as part of a shared decision-making process. Advice to discontinue oral traditional csDMARDs except hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine seems prudent. The data on the effectiveness of IL-6 inhibitors in randomised trials has been largely disappointing 48 . Further knowledge derived from clinical trials of agents such as JAK inhibitors and anti-TNF may see these agents also be able to be continued as part of a shared decision making process however this awaits more definitive clinical trial outcome data 2 .To date the rheumatology community has shown enormous commitment to collect data to There have also been numerous reports of prolonged symptoms after the acute illness of COVID-19 has settled, so called ""Long-COVID"" 51 . What this entity is and whether it is one or • The risk factors for poor outcome from general population of age and co-morbidity also apply to patients with rheumatic disease• Some anti-rheumatic drugs like glucocorticoids may be associated with poorer outcomes but in the absence of known or suspected infection, it is recommended that antirheumatic therapy should be continued unchanged• Entering patients with rheumatic disease who contract COVID-19 into an appropriate registry will help investigators better determine the drug-and disease-specific issues over time• There is a need to study specific classes of medication for their individual risk profiles• There is a need to study patients with individual rheumatic diseases to clarify whether there is differential risk between rheumatic diseases• There is a need to study the safety and efficacy of vaccines directed at protecting from SARS-CoV-2 infection and adverse outcomes specifically in patients with rheumatic disease J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fRG reports non-financial support from Pfizer Australia, personal fees from Pfizer Australia, personal fees from Cornerstones, personal fees from Janssen New Zealand, non-financial support from Janssen Australia, personal fees from Novartis, outside the submitted work.

b926a8781571d9c7c997050d7cbc8c98efd097bc,Rising to the challenge: Overcoming Shared Resource Laboratory biosafety challenges during a pandemic RUNNING TITLE: COVID-19 SRL Biosafety guidelines,"Biohazardous materials are commonly encountered in flow cytometry SRLs. As with any laboratory setting, the standard approach to safety when working with potential hazards is to perform a thorough risk assessment on the infectious agents, reagents, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and the instrumentation proposed for use. Protocols are put in place to help reduce these inherent risks, managed through the implementation of primary controls such as; engineering controls, personal protective equipment (PPE) and SOPs (1) . Biosafety considerations when handling samples before, during, and post-acquisition have always been front of mind in flow cytometry SRLs, particularly related to droplet-based cell sorters. The SRL, by its definition, handles a wide variety of samples and hosts users from many laboratories, universities, institutions and companies. Considering that the current pandemic is spread via respiratory transmission and remains viable on surfaces for prolonged periods (2) , the actions of one individual can impact many with wide-spread downstream consequences. In times of epidemics, pandemics and emerging disease, the potential risks Accepted Article associated with working within an SRL are evolving, giving cause for re-evaluation of our practices to accommodate these new challenges.The SRL, by its nature, is a multi-user environment that facilitates interaction between different members of a research community including SRL staff and users. In the case of COVID-19, a vaccine is currently unavailable against the causative agent (SARS-CoV-2), and it is currently not feasible to perform screening for asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals. This pandemic has necessitated significant changes in the working environment and management of the workforce, with increased expectations put on staff and users. As a result of these changes, added attention needs to be given to the human contribution to the risks associated when working within the context of a shared-use space. With respect to biosafety risks, staff and users must now be included in this assessment and operational guidelines should be identified. For most institutions, these expectations are defined by the level of biosafety threat to individuals and the specific institution's approach to risk (1) . We review below some simple strategies that can be employed to maintain a safe and healthy SRL working environment.tech approaches that use purpose-built programs for self-assessment, to low-tech paper versions (4, 5) . More detailed screening methods, from sampling of body temperatures, as well as polymerase chain reaction and serological tests, have also been employed. Institutional and regional policies will dictate when this type of testing is warranted and provide guidelines regarding periods for self-isolation or quarantine. In many institutions, once a positive case has been identified, contact tracing is undertaken to identify individuals at risk so that they may follow the recommended procedures for testing and self-isolation (6) .SRL facility management systems can help to quickly determine who should be contacted when a user or staff member tests positive (7) . Some SRLs have access to high-tech methodologies that enable contact tracing such as badge scanners at the door of the SRL.Low-tech solutions should also be considered including having a sign-in/sign-out log. This manual system is important for users who come to the SRL for purposes other than to utilise an instrument, such that usage would not be recorded in instrument booking systems. For further details on possible booking systems and visitor tracking options please refer to Table   1 .Additional consideration should be given to those who must enter the SRL to provide specialist services, such as instrument maintenance and installation. Prior to their arrival these individuals should be informed of the institution's screening process, escort rules, and other relevant guidelines for working within the facility. In the case where they are arriving from another country or region, government travel regulations must be considered and adhered to.While every effort can be made to identify all potential contacts of a positive case, this may not always be all-encompassing. Thus, having in place a policy that assumes anyone may be infectious (similar to standard precautions when handling biological samples), is crucial to ensure a safe SRL working environment.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.Many facilities have put in place operational policies that help to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Although the specific policies and recommendations may vary between institutions, they all serve to reduce transmission through: 1. physical distancing of individuals, 2.improved decontamination of common workspaces, and 3. the use of PPE.1. Physical Distancing: There are different methods that can be employed to physically distance users and operators within an SRL. If space is not an issue, instruments can be relocated to other spaces or moved further apart to facilitate physical distancing.Rotating shifts for both core facility staff and users can help to reduce the number of persons in a given lab at one time. To complement this, strategies should be employed to minimize possible overlap of users and the number of users in a space by preventing the simultaneous booking of instruments in close proximity. The companion manuscript on regulatory measures (7) covers these issues in detail.Remote support can further reduce physical contact, while maintaining training and support. These same software solutions can also be employed by users who often will work side-by-side on an instrument to demonstrate data acquisition to new colleagues.These strategies can be encouraged to allow for mentoring to continue, while taking place remotely. There are a number of easy-to-use software platforms (see Table 1 ) that can be used to facilitate remote sessions between SRL users and staff alike, as reviewed in detail by Daniels et al. (8) .2. Environmental Decontamination Procedures: Cleaning procedures will vary between facilities; however, these typically include cleaning protocols for high-touch surfaces such as instrument keyboards, mouse, webcams, headsets, as well as all surface areas of the instrument contacted by a user (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . A list of surface disinfectants shown toThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.be effective against SARS-CoV-2 can be found in Table 2 . Enhancement of ventilation in SRL spaces is also recommended to further reduce the risk of environmental contamination (15, 16 The need for physical distancing means the majority of SRLs are operating with some level of remote support. There are added pressures at this time as research groups must keep working, often on rotating shifts, and under the expectation they will not exceed booking times in order to maintain compliance with room occupancy restrictions. This extra pressure may potentially impact users' abilities to correctly follow protocols. Thus, added precautions should be implemented to not only limit the frequency of potential errors, but also to limit their impact. For example, additional training time in the form of remote support by SRL staff can be included in the first few sessions a new user runs on their own. This also means that users should be trained to follow all new procedures and consistent communication should be implemented to support users in these new policies (1).This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.The strategies reviewed here aim to reduce person-to-person contact and subsequent spread of disease while maintaining interactions between members of an SRL. For SRLs, the challenge is to implement working policies that both safeguard the health and well-being of all staff and users, while maintaining a high level of support to ensure continuity of research services. This is a delicate balance as the measures put into place to reduce person-to-person contact can potentially also reduce the ability for SRL staff to provide support to their users.An example of a risk assessment for working with a SARS-CoV-2 infected user in an SRL setting is attached in Appendix I.Historically, facilities have effectively managed inherent risks by implementing ""StandardPrecautions"" in laboratories in line with their biosafety containment level. StandardPrecautions are such that all human specimens are assumed potentially infectious, and protective measures are implemented to reduce the risk of transmission (19) . These precautions include the use of protective barriers such as: hand hygiene, gloves, gowns, masks, and protective eyewear or face shields. If procedures are likely to result in a higher risk of transmission, e.g. producing droplets or aerosols, it is recommended that a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) or physical barrier is used (19 respiratory nature of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, this means we must maintain heightened awareness of all processes that may result in the generation of droplets and aerosols.A number of factors interplay to determine the final risk associated with running a particular sample on a specific instrument. Effective communication between investigator, shared resource laboratory and safety officer is critical to ensure a cohesive approach when defining a safety assessment in the context of an SRL (Figure 1 ). It is recommended that the SRL, along with their biosafety officer, perform a biological safety assessment for each laboratory group and their specific samples (20, 21) . A template for such a risk assessment has been It is at this point that engineering controls, appropriate PPE and SOPs can start to be applied to control for these risks.The ISAC Biosafety committee has written extensively on the assessment of aerosols created by droplet cell sorters and the dangers posed to the sort operator (22) . In summary, prior to any cell sorting, a risk assessment needs to be performed that will help identify and mitigate It should also be noted that a number of microfluidic and chip based flow cytometry cell sorters have been brought to market in the last 5-10 years. Aerosol generation by these cell sorters is kept to a minimum due to their design; however, there is still a need to validate the sorting safety of these instruments in each environment and with individual users. The ISAC Biosafety Committee has published standards for testing of aerosol management and these standards should be used and adapted to fit each individual situation and instrumentation.The SRL may decide that only facility staff will operate sorters and room requirements may dictate that only one person can be present. In this context, contact-free sorting can be facilitated by thorough documentation encompassing critical parameters such as the reagentsThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.and remote control software (Table 1) are effective for the required interactions such as gate confirmation (8).As discussed above, the operation of cell sorters is well classified due to the significant risk of aerosol generation, with SRL staff trained to ensure safe operation in line with well developed, evidence based SOPs. The use of analyzers is generally considered low risk due to their enclosed systems and low pressures. However, there appears to be little empirical evidence to support this (28, 29) . While analyzers can be considered a lower risk than cell sorters, at this time they pose an uncharacterized risk, often operated by a large volume of users with varying levels of experience. As such it is important that strategies are implemented to reduce the risk associated with pathogenic and human samples in the SRL setting (30) . These strategies can be subdivided into two main areas: standard operating procedure controls and engineering controls.Utilising fixation as a SOP control allows facilities to minimise the risk of running hazardous and potentially hazardous samples in their SRL space. The most common inactivation process utilised for flow cytometry analysis is the use of formaldehyde solution in various concentrations. Incorporating a fixation protocol into the preparation of samples is a procedure familiar to many users, making this a straightforward process for controlling risk.Fixation is often performed with the primary goal of stabilising samples for downstream assays (e.g. intracellular staining). However, fixation protocols designed for stabilisation may not necessarily result in pathogen inactivation and special care is needed in the assessmentThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. and development of fixation protocols (14, 22, (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) . Commercial products, both within and across companies, often contain varying concentrations of fixative. This information is often not immediately obvious, and it is therefore necessary to reference the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) along with the protocol when performing fixation protocol assessments. It is important to note that there is inherent variability in the response of pathogen infectivity to inactivation. There is extensive literature detailing pathogen inactivation by varying compounds and this should be reviewed when determining the suitability of a fixation protocol (36, 40, (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) . We are now seeing literature emerging detailing inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 with formaldehyde solution (47) (48) (49) (50) , this is summarized in Table 2 . In instances where pathogens are emerging or classified as Risk Group 3/4 all fixation and inactivation protocols are recommended to be validated by the laboratory undertaking the research rather than relying solely on literature (24) . Viral inactivation validation protocols vary and literature should be reviewed, and local safety officers consulted, when developing protocols for the local context. Viral inactivation validation protocols can be found in these references (36, 40, (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) . In all fixation protocols it is imperative to consider the (i) fixative used, (ii) how fresh this fixative is, (iii) the concentration of the fixative, (iv) the time of incubation and, (v) the temperature maintained during incubation (36, 38, 39, 43, 45) .Critically, it has been demonstrated in a number of publications that fixation at low temperatures, for example at 4 o C, often results in insufficient inactivation of pathogens (38, 39, 43, 45) .It is important that protocols are reviewed and any required changes are identified.Implementing changes in policy can be met with reluctance on the part of the users due to fear of potential impacts on existing work. Facilities can ameliorate this concern by demonstrating that protocol changes do not impact results in any significant manner. Staining protocols, particularly for intracellular markers, may be impacted by additional fixation stepsThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.if not implemented with care. Some guidance on staining protocols can be found in this methodology publication (51) . Preliminary data from a high-dimensional panel indicates that various fixation protocols do not necessarily alter signal intensity or interpretation of data ( Figure 2 ). Results showed that fixation with a 4% formaldehyde solution (freshly prepared from paraformaldehyde (PFA)) under different incubation conditions did not alter the forward versus side scatter plots (FSC-A vs SSC-A; Figure 2A Significant value lies in testing fixation protocols to determine potential impact on assays. It should be acknowledged that some protocols will not function on fixed samples. The situation may necessitate examination of alternative assays, for example an apoptosis assay that allows for fixation (52) or a move to implementing engineering controls for such samples. Due to the pandemic we are now working in an environment with significant inherent risks, so stakeholders will now be seeking out protocols and reagents that facilitate a reduction of this risk. This is an area in which manufacturers have the opportunity to expand their market by identifying new protocols, taking into account viral inactivation and identifying stability of their reagents after fixation.While some engineering controls already exist on instruments, the most effective control for facilities looking to run unfixed hazardous samples may be (as per standard precautions) to enclose an analyzer and any potential aerosols inside a BSC (30, 53) . Historically this was notThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.possible due to the size of instrumentation (30) , but this is no longer the case with many benchtop analyzers (Figure 3 ). The ability to enclose a benchtop analyzer in a BSC opens up options for users in the types of protocols and samples that can be run while maintaining biosafety containment. However, a number of factors need to be carefully considered before moving down this path:• Biological safety assessment: Determine if a BSC is required for the types of samples handled within the facility.• Frequency of live hazardous samples: Depending on how frequently a facility encounters live hazardous samples, the use of a cell sorter contained within a BSC may be sufficient to accommodate user needs.• Accommodation of instrument within BSC: Sufficient air flow around instrument within standard BSC for both heat dispersion and maintaining functional containment.Custom BSC options may need to be explored.• Thermal load: Instrument specifications, such as number of lasers, should be considered. For example, the more lasers, the more heat produced and the less stable the system may be.• Training: Adequate training must be provided for appropriate use of the instrument inside the BSC to ensure containment of hazards is maintained.• Accessories: components such as vortex, pipettes and tube racks will be needed within the BSC to ensure ease of use and reinforcement of safe behaviours.Placement of an analyzer inside a BSC increases the burden on facility staff due to the need for additional sample handling training for users and ensuring continued compliance withThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.these behaviours. Additional costs are also associated with the initial BSC purchase and continued certification. The need for such a set-up is limited and unlikely to be necessary for many SRLs if other measures can be effectively implemented.Inactivation of instrument waste is an important consideration for SRLs. Recommendations state that waste containers should hold enough bleach to result in a ""10% final concentration of bleach"" when the waste tank is full (30, 22) . Local regulations and institution guidelines vary considerably and must be considered when developing a protocol for biohazardous waste disposal. A number of publications detailing wastewater pathogen inactivation are available and may be used as a guide when developing local protocols (54, (56) (57) (58) (59) . It should be noted that the stability of bleach is impacted by a number of factors including, but not limited to, pH, temperature, exposure to light and dilution (59) . The management of waste in SRLs should be structured to ensure that waste is exposed to bleach for a sufficient period of time, at an adequate concentration of free chlorine (54) . In some situations, such as in BSL-3 laboratory waste streams, autoclaving flow cytometry waste may be considered (22) .However, this introduces some complexity due to the potential generation of hazardous gases, such as from wastewater containing formaldehyde or bleach solutions (60) .This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.The SRL is a hub for scientific activity, creating a centralized resource that investigators rely on for specialized equipment and technical expertise. The ability to pivot operational structures in response to a pandemic, communicate changed practices, and facilitate continued access, has played an essential role not only for research in general, but also in developing our understanding of SARS-CoV-2. Every day we are seeing the emergence of new COVID-19 research, bringing with it potential changes in our understanding and subsequent changes to the safety measures implemented by SRLs. Biological safety assessment needs to consider not only samples and reagents but also the SRL staff, users and visitors as potential risks. Ensuring and maintaining adherence to standard precautions at all times while working within the SRL space will significantly reduce the risk for eachindividual and subsequently to the wider research community with whom they associate.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.The ability of an SRL to rapidly respond to the emergence of a new pathogen centers on having established biological safety assessment procedures in place (3, 21, 30) , along with a human risk assessment (Appendix I). At this time literature is starting to form a consensus around the stability and inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 (14, (34) (35) (36) (39) (40) (41) (47) (48) (49) (50) . Exactly how these inactivation methods are applied in SRLs will relate directly to the sample type and the level of risk posed. Samples infected with cultured virus should be treated with significant caution, followed by SARS-CoV-2 positive human tissues known to generate propagative virus, and then those tissues not known to carry propagative virus (30, (61) (62) (63) (64) (65) (66) (67) (68) (69) (70) . Standard precautions apply to all human samples, with a biological safety assessment utilised to help guide the application of additional control measures relative to the local context (1) (Supplementary Table 1 ).Facilitating a safety conversation with users should be the foundation of safety within the SRL. Engaging those who must practice safety measures in the SRL space in these conversations encourages ownership and supports a culture of safety (1). Once a biological safety assessment ( Figure 1 ) and human risk assessment (Appendix I) has been completed and measures put in place, it is then the role of the SRL to ensure effective communication, and thus support users in their ability to comply with these measures. Communication is the key component in ensuring safety during a pandemic.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Figure 1 . Effective communication between investigator, shared resource laboratory and safety officer ensures a cohesive approach when defining biological safety assessment in the context of an SRL. As in everything we do, our ability to identify the risks, assess them and then go on to manage them is limited by our ability to communicate with all involved parties.It is in the framing of these biosafety discussions that SRL staff can have the most impact,where the focus is understanding, communicating perceived risks, followed by collaborating to determine an appropriate safety response. While compromise may not always be possible, there are invariably instances where inclusion of users leads to innovative solutions and new approaches to safety. There is a certain amount of trust required between users and SRL staff.This trust is developed by having ongoing discussions around safety, developing a cultural expectation of safety and continued inclusive discussions. There is a significant mental andThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.time burden to the maintenance and communication of appropriate biological risk management. However, it is imperative, especially during pandemics, that SRLs have effective processes in place to ensure the safety of everyone who uses their space. This article is protected by copyright.

e47a691df4faa1f6ae07b965b372b0676ad1bb78,Māori and Pacific People in New Zealand have higher risk of hospitalisation for COVID-19,"Up to 25 September 2020, New Zealand reported 1,829 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China. The majority of these cases were associated with one of two outbreaks of sustained community transmission: the first in March/April 2020 and the second in August/September 2020. Up to 22 May, there 1,504 confirmed and probable cases. Between 22 May and 11 August, there were 65 cases, all of which were in detected in international arrivals and contained in government-managed isolation facilities. Between 11 August and 25 September, 260 cases were reported, with the majority linked to a large cluster in Auckland.The August cluster differed substantially from the initial outbreak in March/April 2020. The vast majority of cases resulted from workplace, community, public transport and household transmission, rather than being associated with international travel 1 . The August cluster had a higher proportion of cases under 20 years old and a lower proportion of cases over 60 years old than the earlier outbreak ( Figure 1) . It also contained a much higher proportion of cases among the Pacific and Māori populations that the first outbreak 1, 2 . The Pacific community values multi-generational living, but the lack of high-quality suitable housing means that this is often overcrowded 3 . Pacific people also experience poorer access to healthcare 4, 5 and are at greater risk of clinically severe outcomes from COVID-19 infection 6 .We developed three separate risk models to quantify the risk of hospitalisation, length of hospital stay and fatality risk. Each model used the same methodology and set of predictor variables.Case data was obtained on all 1,829 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 reported in New Zealand up to 25 September 2020. The data included hospitalisation status and dates, clinical outcome (i.e. recovered, death), age, sex, underlying health conditions, StatsNZ meshblock of current home address, and ethnicity (see Table 1 ).The data on underlying health conditions were simplified into a binary variable indicating if the individual had at least one of the following conditions: chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, immunodeficiency, asthma, or malignancy. These are all known to be associated with increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation 9 .The meshblock number of residential address was used to allocate a measure of geographic socioeconomic deprivation based on the New Zealand deprivation index (NZDep18) 10 . This was not available for 34 cases, so any models that include deprivation index had a smaller sample size of 1,795 cases and 114 hospitalisations.For each of the three models, we carried out a simple analysis to determine which predictor variables to include in the model. We used a logistic regression to determine which of ethnicity, underlying health conditions, sex, age, and deprivation should be included. We used Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for model selection 11, 12 .The complete model was:During the model selection phase, ethnicity (using prioritised ethnicity) was consistently identified as a significant predictor variable in all three models. Using priority ethnicity neglects important information on individuals who were in multiple ethnicity groups 14 . For example, there were 19 individuals who were recorded as Māori and Pacific, none of whom were hospitalised. In the standard prioritisation routine, these individuals were classified as Māori and did not, therefore, contribute to model estimates for Pacific people. This undercounted Pacific cases and potentially created agerelated biases in the results for Pacific people, as younger Pacific people are more likely to report multiple ethnicities 15 . To correct for this, we reran each model using different ethnicity prioritisation orderings (see Table 2 ). Odds-ratios and confidence intervals on the odds-ratios were obtained by exponentiating the coefficient estimates and confidence intervals on the coefficient estimates for each risk factor.Ethnicity effect being estimated Prioritisation ordering Māori Māori, Pacific, Asian, NZ European/Other Pacific Pacific, Māori, Asian, NZ European/Other Asian Asian, Māori, Pacific, NZ European/Other Table 2 . Ethnicity prioritisation ordering depending on the ethnicity effect being estimated.In addition to the risk of hospitalisation, we used a linear model to consider the effect of these variables on length of hospital stay:In this final model, as there were no fatalities in Asian people, we combined the Asian and NZ European/Other ethnicity groups. For both these models, we used the same methodology as for the risk of hospitalisation model, i.e. we used standard ethnicity prioritisation to identify significant predictor variables then re-analysed the contribution of these predictor variables under different ethnicity prioritisation orderings.For risk of hospitalisation, the model containing age, ethnicity, and the presence of underlying health conditions as predictor variables gave the most parsimonious fit (lowest AIC). This model also has the same predictive power (similar AUC) as more complex models (see Table 3 ). Including interaction terms did not improve the model fit as measured by AIC. Age was always the strongest predictor of hospitalisation and was included in all models. After age has been accounted for, the best two-variable model also included ethnicity.Coefficient estimates associated with sex were always close to zero and had consistently large pvalues, indicating that sex was not a strong predictor of hospitalisation in New Zealand's COVID-19The odds ratios for different ethnicities shown in Figure 3 represent the increase in risk after controlling for underlying health conditions, which are present in higher rates in Māori and Pacific people 16 . In the 1,829 cases in the data, there was only a very small correlation between having underlying conditions recorded and either Māori ethnicity (Pearson's r-squared 2 = 0.07) or Pacific ethnicity ( 2 = 0.02), so the results were not affected by multi-collinearity in these variables.proportional effect in each ethnicity. Māori and Pacific people have lower life expectancy, higher rates of multi-morbidity and respiratory illness, higher rates of under-reporting of comorbid conditions, and typically experience adverse health outcomes at an earlier age 16 17 18 . These factors have not been accounted for in the model and may exacerbate the risk of clinically severe outcomes from COVID-19for Māori and Pacific people. For risk of fatality, the model containing only age and deprivation index as predictor variables gave the most parsimonious fit (lowest AIC). In this model, an additional year of age increased the odds of fatality by 15.9% (11.5%, 20.4%) ( = 3 × 10 −14 ). A unit increase in deprivation index was associated with a 0.80% (0.33%, 1.27%) increase in the odds of fatality ( = 0.001). The difference in deprivation score between the 1 st and 4 th quintiles in the dataset was 146. This means that the model predicts that an individual at the 80 th percentile of deprivation has 3.19 times the risk of fatality as someone at the 20 th percentile in this dataset.International evidence suggests a linear relationship between log infection fatality rates and age , with one paper estimating an increase in probability of death of 12.9% per year of age 19 . This is comparable to our results (although changes in the infection fatality rate are not identical to changes in odds, they are close at small probabilities).The number of fatalities was, fortunately, too small to draw any concrete conclusions on the relationship between risk of fatality and ethnicity. There were no models where ethnicity was a consistently statistically significant predictor of fatality risk. However, this is most likely due to inadequate statistical power of the small sample. Furthermore, the majority of fatalities are linked to aged care facilities, so are not a representative sample of fatalities if COVID-19 were to become more widespread in the community.New Zealand's experience with the COVID-19 epidemic indicates that Māori and Pacific people are at much greater risk of hospitalisation following infection with COVID-19. It is widely understood from overseas experience that the risk of hospitalisation for COVID-19 increases rapidly with age. However, the effects of ethnicity in New Zealand are not so well understood. Our results show that a healthy Māori person has the same risk of hospitalisation for COVID-19 as a healthy person in the NZ European/Other ethnic group who is 21 years older. A healthy Pacific person has the same risk of hospitalisation as a healthy person in the NZ European/Other ethnic group who is 25 years older.We have only considered the risk of being hospitalised given an individual had COVID-19. The overall risk of being hospitalised also depends on the likelihood of infection. COVID-19 can spread quickly in communities with higher levels of workplace or community interaction, crowded housing, insecure employment, and decreased access to healthcare or COVID-19 testing. These are frequently the same communities that are at higher risk of hospitalisation and fatality if infected, meaning there is additional potential burden of the epidemic on these people. When fitting each model, we assigned each individual to only one ethnicity as the sample size precluded investigation of all ethnicity combinations. This means that our results cannot be used additively to estimate the risk of hospitalisation for an individual belonging to multiple ethnicities.Other effects are additive in the log-odds. For example, an individual with underlying health conditions has log-odds of hospitalisation that is 0.553 greater than another individual of the same age and ethnicity without underlying health conditions.We conclude that Māori and Pacific people have substantially higher risk of hospitalisation for COVID-19, after controlling for age, presence of underlying health conditions, and socioeconomic deprivation.We have previously estimated that Māori and Pacific people would experience higher infection fatality rates from COVID-19 6 . Our new results add to the imperative for New Zealand's COVID-19 response to include a focus on measures to protect high-risk groups and to prevent the large-scale inequities in health outcomes that would result from widespread community transmission 22 . Our results also have clear implications for identifying priority groups for vaccination against COVID-19, for which planning is currently underway. They demonstrate that it will be essential to account for ethnicity when targeting vaccination to age groups based on their risk of clinically severe infection. For example, our results show that NZ European/Other people aged 80 have a comparable risk to that of Māori aged 59 and Pacific people aged 55.",New Zealand,abstract,2020-12-28,12
894d709f2a017e32e72a6ec85c6f6328b9483579,Effects of face masks on acoustic analysis and speech perception: Implications for peri-pandemic protocols a),"Face masks (alongside physical distancing) provide some protection against infection from Coronavirus disease (Chu et al., 2020) . Their use in public spaces and healthcare settings is either recommended or mandatory in many jurisdictions internationally. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control (CDC, 2020) recommends mask use to minimize droplet dispersion and aerosolization of the virus (Bahl et al., 2020) . Clinical trials and healthcare settings continue to assess speech production, which generates respiratory droplets while unrestricted exposure increases the likelihood of disease contraction (Stadnytskyi et al., 2020) . Risk of transmission increases through behaviors common in many speech assessment tasks including continuous and loud speech (Asadi et al., 2019) . At the same time, acknowledgement of the necessity of personal protective equipment (PPE) to minimize virus transmission has increased internationally (Asadi et al., 2019; Stadnytskyi et al., 2020; Zaga et al., 2020) . Masks, however, alter the speech signal with downstream effects on intelligibility of a speaker. The use of personal protective equipment poses some unique challenges for speech assessment.Most masks prevent visual access to the speaker's lips and create a barrier during communication. This in itself can hinder speech perception, especially in noisy environments or when the listener has a hearing impairment (Hampton et al., 2020) . Masks can muffle speech sounds, especially higher frequencies that can aid the differentiation of similar sounds. The acoustic effect of a speaker wearing a face mask is equivalent to the listener having a slight highfrequency hearing loss (Corey et al., 2020) . The type of mask worn may uniquely affect acoustic and speech perception, as mask types vary in their composition and how they are designed to sit on the wearer's face. The three most common mask types for preventing disease transmission are cloth, surgical, and N95 filtering facepiece respirator (N95 mask). Cloth masks are often 2-ply and made from a single fabric type (e.g., cotton). The tightness of the fabric weave and mask fit vary widely. Surgical masks are commonly 3ply nonwoven fabric with a water-resistant outer layer, filter middle layer, and water-absorbing inner lay. Surgical masks fit loosely on the face with air able to escape from the sides. N95 masks are similar in composition to surgical masks with the main differences being a higher filtration rate and a tight seal around the wearer's face, preventing air escape (O'Dowd et al., 2020) .We evaluated the impact wearing a mask has on acoustic output and speech perception. We examined how a) This paper is part of a special issue on COVID-19 PANDEMIC ACOUSTIC EFFECTS. (surgical, cloth, and N95) , in combination with microphone variations (headset vs tabletop), affect speech recordings and perceived intelligibility. We hypothesized the acoustic output would be impacted based on the composition/thickness of masks while perceived intelligibility will remain largely unaffected.Overall, seven subjects (aged 28.1 6 6.0 years, range 21-39; four males, three females), were included in the study. All speakers were English speaking with no dysphonia, cognitive, or neurological impairments. One male (15 years since exposed to English) and female (26 years since exposed to English) were subsequent bilinguals and reported English as their second language.A. Speech Acquisition and feature extraction for acoustic output Four subjects (aged 29.3 6 6.0 years; two males, two females) completed a speech battery consisting of sustaining an open vowel /a+/ for approximately six seconds, reproduced ten times and reading a phonetically balanced text, the Grandfather Passage (Van Riper, 1963) , reproduced five times. The speech battery was repeated under four conditions using inter-subject counter balancing. Conditions included (1) no mask, (2) standard surgical mask (regulated under 21 CFR 878.4040), (3) cloth mask (2-layered cotton), and (4) N95 mask (electrostatic non-woven polypropylene fiber containing a filtration layer) (Fig. 1 ). Subjects were instructed to speak in a natural manner at a comfortable pitch and pace.Speech samples were simultaneously recorded using two standardized methods: (1) Using a head-mounted cardioid condenser microphone (AKG520, Harman International, Stamford, CT) positioned two inches from the corner of the subject's mouth (minimum sensitivity of À43 dB, near flat frequency response) and coupled with a QUAD-CAPTURE USB 2.0 Audio Interface (Roland Corporation, Shizuoka, Japan) connected to a laptop computer, and (2) Using a Blue Yeti (Blue Microphones, Westlake Village, CA) tabletop microphone (sensitivity 4.5 mV/Pa) connected to a laptop computer. The microphone was positioned 5 feet from the subject to simulate physical distancing measures. Standardization of the recording environment was achieved by recording in the absence of traffic, electrical, appliance, or other background noise. All recordings were sampled at 44.1 kHz with 32-bit quantization. Each recording produced was $40 min in length (per subject).Audio files were screened for deviations and synchronized between microphones to ensure uniformity of length. Acoustic measures of timing, frequency, power spectral density (PSD), and perturbation extracted from sustained vowel and reading tasks using Praat software (Boersma, 2001) . Acoustic measures were specifically chosen to estimate the overall loss of speech-sound intensity or attenuation effect (speech intensity prominence), frequency-specific loss of intensity or filtering effect (PSD, center-of-gravity, COG), and possible consequences of filtering on commonly used measures of voice quality (harmonic-to-noise ratio and cepstral peak prominence). We additionally included commonly used measures which are likely independent of attenuation or filtering effects, namely, fundamental frequency and speech-silence analysis on the time domain. Measures of timing (detection of silence-speech and speech-silence transitions) were extracted using an energy threshold on the time domain (Rosen et al., 2010; Vogel et al., 2017) . The threshold was set to 65% of the 95th percentile, with minimum silence length set to 20 ms and minimum speech length to 30 ms. Fundamental frequency was calculated through autocorrelation within a restricted range (70-250 Hz for males, 100-300 Hz for females) (Vogel et al., 2009 ). The analysis window was 43 and 30 ms, respectively, and window shift fixed at 10 ms. The maximum number of formants was set at 5 with a maximum of 5500 Hz for formant detection. All other parameters were maintained at default software settings. The PSD (dB/kHz relative 2 Â 10 À5 Pa) in the long-term average spectrum was extracted from the reading task to information on how ""each frequency"" contributes to the total sound power. CoG (in Hz) is defined as the mean frequency that divides the power spectrum in equal halves was calculated from the power spectrum. The intensity of background noise (floor) was determined as equal to the average intensity during the quietest three seconds of each files (i.e., in the absence of vocalization). Floor intensity was subtracted from the average intensity (during vocalization) for each task (vowel and reading) to determine the speech intensity prominence. Features of interest included cepstral peak prominence smoothed (CPPS), harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR), local jitter, and shimmer for the sustained vowel, and average and standard deviation of pause length for the reading task.Single word and sentence intelligibility were evaluated in five subjects (aged 29.3 6 7.1 years; two males, two females) using the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthria Speech (ASSIDS) (Yorkston and Beukelman, 1984) . The assessment involved subjects reading 50 randomly selected one-or two-syllable words and 22 randomly selected sentences, ranging in length from 5 to 15 words. Subjects were instructed to speak in a natural manner at a comfortable pitch and pace. ASSIDS was assessed under four conditions (inter-subject counter balance of no mask, surgical, N95, and cloth masks). Each subject's responses were audio-recorded using the tabletop microphone (sensitivity 4.5 mV/Pa) positioned 5 feet from the subject (recording produced was $20 min in length per subject).Each recording was then blinded to mask condition and transcribed by five independent listeners (aged 37.5 6 9.0 years; one male, four females; two listeners reported English as their second language). Listeners were asked to transcribe the word/sentence the subject was trying to say. Transcriptions were the collated and scored for each condition, with a total score of 50 for words and 220 for sentences. Scores were then converted to percentage to establish intelligibility of single words (ASSIDS words intelligibility) and sentences (ASSIDS intelligibility sentences) for each mask condition. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using Fleiss multi-rater Kappa. Fleiss' kappa showed a high degree of agreement between listeners on single words (j ¼ 0.88, p < 0.001) and sentences (j ¼ 0.74, p < 0.001).To understand the effect of masks on perceived intelligibility (ASSIDS words and sentences intelligibility) and acoustic parameters, a linear mixed-effects model analysis with restricted maximum likelihood estimation was applied. Mask type was modeled as a fixed factor, and subject, and order of mask condition as a random factor. Bonferroni corrected planned comparisons were conducted to determine differences in mask type (surgical, N95, and cloth) compared to no mask.To investigate the effect of masks on the PSD, the interaction between mask condition Â frequency band (1 kHz bins) was investigated using a linear mixed-effects model analysis with restricted maximum likelihood estimation. Subject, and order of mask condition as a random factor. Bonferroni corrected planned comparisons were made for each 1 kHz frequency bin (1-10 kHz) to determine differences between masks types compared to no mask. SPSS Statistics was used for these statistical analyses (IBM SPSS Version 26.0).To assess differences in single word and sentence accuracy, a generalized linear mixed-effects model was applied to binomial accuracy data (0:incorrect word/sentence, 1:correct word/sentence) with mask type (4; no mask, surgical, N95, and cloth) and phrase (2; single word, sentence) as fixed factor, with subject and stimulus identity as random factors using the lme4, afex, and effectsize libraries. Planned comparisons were performed using Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference to determine differences in mask type using the multcomp library R 4.0.2 was used for this statistical analysis (R Development Core Team, 2020).ASSIDS single word and sentence intelligibility varied between the speakers and across mask conditions (Table I) .Anecdotally, there was greater variability in ASSIDS single word intelligibility [range 82%-100%; Fig. 2(a) ], than ASSIDS sentences intelligibility [range 91.8%-100%; Fig.  2(b) ]. There was no significant effect of masks on intelligibility for either ASSIDS single words (F 3,34.70 ¼ 0.60, p ¼ 0.621) or ASSIDS sentences (F 3,34.58 ¼ 0.73, p ¼ 0.542).Further investigation revealed that identification accuracy of single word and sentences significantly varied between phrase types (v 2 ¼ 94.98, p < 0.001, Cramer's V ¼ 0.11) and across mask conditions (v 2 ¼ 15.03, p ¼ 0.002, Cramer's V ¼ 0.05), although the interaction was not significant (v 2 ¼ 1.32, p ¼ 0.73, Cramer's V ¼ 0.01). Pairwise comparisons revealed decreased accuracy for speakers wearing a surgical (p ¼ 0.029), N95 (p ¼ 0.014), or cloth mask (p ¼ 0.012) compared to no mask; there were no significant differences between masks (ps > 0.99).Frequency bands were collapsed into 1 kHz bins to explore differences in PSD between mask type. There was a Mask Â frequency band interaction effect (F 27 755 ¼ 2.50, p ¼ 0.006). Post hoc comparisons showed power (dB/Hz 2 ) was significantly lower between 3 and 10 kHz for the N95 mask (p < 0.001) and 5-10 kHz for both the surgical (p < 0.001) and cloth masks (p < 0.001) when compared to no mask on recordings made using the head-mounted microphone [ Fig. 3(a) ]. No significant differences were observed between mask conditions on recordings made using the tabletop microphone [F 27 757 ¼ 1.41, p ¼ 0.082; Fig. 3(b) ].For recordings produced with the head-mounted microphone, there was a significant effect of masks for mean pause length (F 3,8.97 ¼ 3.88, p ¼ 0.05), percentage of pauses (F 3,8.40 ¼ 7.36, p ¼ 0.01), and spectral tilt (F 3,8.98 ¼13.62, p ¼ 0.001) extracted from the reading task. Post hoc comparisons showed that recordings produced with the N95 mask increased percentage of pauses (p ¼ 0.023) (Table II) . Spectral tilt was lower in recordings produced with the surgical (p ¼ 0.016) and N95 masks (p ¼ 0.001). For recordings produced with the tabletop microphone, there was a significant effect of mask type for percentage of pauses (F 3,7.87 ¼ 8.17, p ¼ 0.008), and spectral tilt (F 3,8.39 ¼ 15.43, p ¼ 0.001) (Table II) . Post hoc comparisons revealed that the N95 and cloth masks yielded higher percentage of pauses (N95 p ¼ 0.022; Cloth p ¼ 0.029) no mask. As with the head-mounted microphone, recordings produced with the tabletop microphone yielded lower spectral tilt values 3.

No significant differences were observed in acoustic parameters extracted from the sustained vowel recorded using either the head-mounted or tabletop microphone.The type of mask affected the speech signal. We observed significant differences in acoustic power distribution across relevant frequency bands for speech in all three mask conditions compared to no mask. The differences were not observed in frequencies below 3 kHz. Differences in signal for higher frequencies led to altered acoustic outcomes including spectral tilt. The masks, however, did not significantly influence listener-perceived intelligibility or acoustic measures of perturbation (e.g., HNR, CPPS). Measures of speech rate were lower for N95 and surgical masks, possibly as speakers compensate when wearing masks to improve intelligibility. It is also possible that speech timing differences were related to how speech boundaries are identified in the analysis scripts (i.e., our timing analysis relied on identification of phoneme/word boundaries via intensity thresholds).Intelligibility scores varied between raters and between mask condition. Anecdotally, it can be difficult to understand people when they wear a mask (Goldin et al., 2020) . Our small dataset suggests mask type does not systematically impact intelligibility in controlled environments. Our recordings were made with high-quality microphones in quiet environments. Raters listened to samples in ideal listening conditions away from distractions and background noise but without visual aid (lips and jaw movement) for all mask conditions. In loud environments, communication can be challenging with multiple distractors, background noise, and a lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Noise in ecological situations may further decrease speech intelligibility, when complementary visual cues blocked by use of face masks play a role in communication. Furthermore, our cohort of subjects included both native and non-native speakers. While our analyses accounted for this, we acknowledge that listeners may have had trouble interpreting accents.It is clear that face masks change the acoustic speech signal, but some specific features remain largely unaffected (e.g., acoustic measures of voice quality) irrespective of mask type. These results have implications for clinical assessments and speech research where PPE is required. It is easy to assume that subjects in a speech study will simply remove PPE during assessments; however, subjects and researchers may be reluctant to do so if it leads to potential exposure to airborne viruses. Researchers should consider microphone placement and sound reinforcement systems (e.g., amplified speech signals) in longitudinal studies with data collection requiring PPE throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, to mitigate against changes to protocols that affect speech (see Fig. 4 ) (Redenlab, 2020) .

c79f6e4a02bf468071b333d9b7432f188578601b,Journal Pre-proof Complement factors in COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines Complement factors in COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines,"deposition of complement proteins MASP2 (MBL pathway), C3, C4 and C5b-C9 has also been reported in lung and cutaneous tissue samples from severe COVID-19 patients, but healthy samples were included as experimental controls in only one single study (control data were not shown) [17] [18] [19] [20] . Moreover, complement may contribute to dysregulated cytokine responses observed in some COVID-19 patients, which has been described as a ""cytokine storm"", although there is some question as to whether this term is misleading given that the concentrations of IL-6 in COVID-19 patients have been reported to be up to 40-fold lower than what has been typically reported for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [21] .Therefore, this question needs to be further addressed; additional discussions on immune responses during COVID-19 have been reviewed elsewhere, to name a few [22, 23] .There has been little investigation into the relationship between complement and clinical complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. One study found moderate correlations between sC5b-C9 concentrations and a single marker of endothelial perturbation (von Willebrand factor, Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.517, p<0.001) [24] ; additional markers were quantified but their correlations were not reported [24] . In hospitalized patients, increased plasma concentration of sC5b-C9 was also associated with an increased odds of respiratory failure (odds ratio 31.9, confidence interval 1.3 to 746.6, p=0.03) relative to those with lower concentrations [25] . In critically-ill patients, the concentrations of MBL were correlated with markers of coagulopathy (D-dimer, Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.390, p=0.002) [26] . One study evaluated the relationship between complement and mortality and found that increased C3 in serum was associated with a reduced odds of mortality (odds ratio 0.073, confidence interval 0.007 to 0.722, p=0.025) relative to those with lower concentrations [27] .Hypothetically, local and systemic complement activation during the acute phase of infection, prior to the development of adaptive immunity, may cause disease pathology. Potential mechanisms for complement-mediated pathology may include complement-induced inflammation, leukocyte infiltration, and MAC formation and lysis of virus-infected cells in the lung. While reasonable, the evidence to support the directionality of this hypothesis is scarce and inferring causality from case-control studies is often problematic, potentially leading to misleading conclusions. For example, neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 can increase with disease severity, yet neutralizing antibodies are also thought to contribute to protective immunity [28] . These differences, however, warrant further investigation. Many of the correlations reported have been from univariate analysis that did J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof not adjust for other co-variables that may have been associated with poor clinical outcomes [24] [25] [26] . There is also a lack of in vitro evidence to support the role of complement in disease pathology. Studies have shown that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins can activate the MBL and alternative pathways, suggesting these mechanisms may contribute to disease pathology, although this remains to be rigorously assessed [29, 30] . Indeed, there is currently no direct evidence that complement can lyse SARS-CoV-2 infected human cells.We instead highlight the possibility that complement might also play a protective role against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with mild disease generally report normal serum concentrations of complement proteins (C3 and C4), which suggests that normally functioning immune mediators may be able to contribute to immunity and reduce disease severity [14] [15] [16] . In line with this, an examination of more than 6,000 COVID-19 patients found that individuals with a dysregulated complement system were more prone to developing severe disease than those with a healthy immune system [31] . Therefore, for most individuals, complement activation might contribute to reduced disease severity, whereas for a smaller percentage of individuals, complement might be dysregulated and associated with susceptibility to severe disease. This possibility remains to be tested.Complement mediates protective immunity against many pathogens through activation of the antibody-dependent classical pathway. Currently, little is known about the potential role of antibody-complement interactions in immunity against SARS-CoV-2.In some studies, innate complement activation and inflammation have also been implicated in the pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)[32-36], caused by SARS-CoV-1, and closely related to SARS-CoV-2. This might occur through MBL binding to the virus, which appears to be neutralizing, but could also lead to complement activation and Journal Pre-proof complement may act more potently against a human-specific pathogen than human complement would; indeed, enhanced cross-species activity was observed in a study of human complement against the murine-specific pathogen, Plasmodium berghei [38] .Complement can also be activated by antigen-specific antibodies and therefore, can contribute to adaptive immune responses. Immunity to many viral and non-viral pathogens relies on antibodies and antibody-mediated neutralization. The binding of C1q alone or additional complement components can significantly enhance antibody neutralization, and in some cases, complement is essential for neutralizing activity. This has been demonstrated in vitro for the human pathogens, West Nile virus [6] [8, 42] , often using a combination of human and non-human (mouse, rabbit, guinea pig) antibodies and complement.There appears to be some balance between the pathogenic and protective roles of complement observed with various infectious pathogens. For example, severe malaria is associated with innate complement activation and inflammation[43], while protective antimalarial immunity is associated with classical complement activation via antibodies [7, 44, 45 ]. Therefore, we hypothesize that under optimal conditions, antibodies and complement might contribute to pathogen neutralization and reduced disease severity. However, when the immune response is suboptimal and cannot effectively clear the infection, complement might instead become hyperactive and cause inflammation-related pathologies. This might also be true for SARS-CoV-2, whereby failure to control infection might lead to a high viral load that triggers multiple pathogenic processes, including those mediated by complement. This concept was supported by a repeat infection study in rabbits. Specifically, rabbits acquired some immunity after primary infection with MERS-CoV, but this was not sufficient to confer protection against re-infection, which instead resulted in increased inflammation. It was only after two infections that an appropriate antibody response was acquired, and when infected for a third time, the infection was controlled, and little immunopathology was observed [46] .Altogether, complement has demonstrated both pathogenic and protective roles in immunity to various pathogens. 56, 57] . Few control studies have been performed; one of these evaluated a combination of C5 (eculizumab) and JAK1/2 (ruxolitinib) inhibitors (treatment n=7, control n=10)in COVID-19 patients [58] . A larger study evaluated the experimental treatment of severe patients with a C5-inhibitor (eculizumab; treatment n=35, control n=45) [59] . The treatment group presented enhanced survival at day 28 (p=0.005), although serious adverse events were 2-fold higher than in controls, and included infectious complications and ventilator-associated pneumonia [59] . The one randomized control, phase 2 trial (NCT04333420) i of a C5-inhibitor administered to severe COVID-19 patients (vilobelimab; treatment n=15, control n=15) found no improvement in the primary outcome of respiratory function (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) [60] , but the authors noted that the study was not sufficiently powered to detect significant differences between groups [60] .While these studies suggest some promise, it is too early to conclude whether complement inhibitors have any clinical benefit in treating severe COVID-19. Several clinical trials of AMY-101 and eculizumab are ongoing, as well as larger clinical studies. We also need to acknowledge that complement inhibitors may not be suitable for all patients, particularly for those with mild disease that display serum concentrations of complement proteins within the normal range [14] [15] [16] . Complement may contribute to mounting an effective immune response, and so, administration of therapeutics to inhibit complement might potentially be harmful in COVID-19 patients with mild disease who may be mounting an effective immune response. Furthermore, complement deficiencies are known to increase the risk of bacterial infections [61] , and several participants treated with eculizumab were reported to have bacterial infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia (some of which did not recover)[50, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [67, 68] . One of these MAbs (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) was also shown to reduce viral RNA copy numbers in a golden Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2, compared to control animals that received saline solution only [68] . These MAbs have significant potential as candidate therapeutic and preventive agents. In general, recent advances in MAb technologies have identified a point mutation in the Fc region (E430G) of IgG that promotes hexamer formation between neighboring IgG molecules, significantly enhancing C1q binding and complement activation [69] . These hexamer antibodies have been largely explored in cancer therapeutics and demonstrate potent complement activation and complement-mediated lysis of cancer cells (isolated from patient cancer cells and cell-lines) in vitro [70] . These approaches might also be potentially valuable for treating infectious diseases, including COVID-19, which certainly merits further investigation. This principle was recently shown with Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacterial infection, whereby a MAb with the hexamerization mutation had greater complement fixation and protective efficacy than the wild-type IgG in a mouse infection model (wild-type BALB/c mice) [71] . Presumably, further enhancing the neutralizing activity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 MAbs by complement binding might be preferable to directly neutralizing MAbs that lack complement activity. We also propose considering combining different therapeutic approaches; for example, it might be possible to use engineered MAbs with enhanced C1q binding for viral neutralization in combination with a C5-inhibitor to prevent terminal complement activation and inflammation in specific clinical syndromes, such as ARDS. However, this remains to be tested.From another angle, vaccines can also be modified to induce antibodies with enhanced binding to C1q; one approach is to modulate the IgG subclass profile, which can be achieved using appropriate vaccine adjuvants (E.g. QS21, AS01, MF59 and Alum) [72] . In humans, IgG1 and IgG3 can potently activate complement (IgG3>IgG1), while IgG2 and IgG4 have little to no activity [66] . Epitopes included in vaccine constructs are also important, as antibodies to different epitopes, even of the same antigen, can have considerable differences in the ability to bind C1q [73] . There is also evidence that targeting multiple epitopes might enhance antibody-complement activity overall [45] . However, little is currently known on whether these MAbs can bind C1q and activate complement, which might enhance neutralizing activity, even for those otherwise considered non-neutralizing antibodies.The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to the receptor ACE2 is ~4-fold higher than seen for the closely related SARS virus, raising concerns that achieving highly effective neutralizing antibodies might be challenging with SARS-CoV-2[67]. We argue that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof complement fixation by antibodies is worth exploring as a potential strategy to achieve maximal antibody-mediated virus neutralization. The molecular details of antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 are beginning to emerge, which can help understand the potential of complement interactions to enhance immunity. Neutralizing MAbs largely target the RBD and sterically block ACE2 receptor binding [74] . Therefore, C1q binding by antibodies might enhance inhibition of receptor binding. In contrast, non-neutralizing MAbs tend to bind outside the RBD [74] . Moreover, antibodies targeting specific epitopes have the potential for inter-molecular cross-linking of SARS-CoV2 S proteins, that might increase the effective avidity of IgG and increase antibody-mediated virus neutralization [75] . C1q binding to multiple IgG molecules might achieve a similar effect to increase the effective avidity and enhance neutralization. Collectively, further evaluations of the role of complement and how this cascade might enhance antibody activity might be a promising avenue to maximize the efficacy of antibody-based therapeutics and vaccines, awaiting future research.Complement has multiple roles in immunity, including in innate and adaptive responses.While excess complement activation has been implicated in severe COVID-19 disease pathology, data supporting this role, or the benefit of complement inhibitors, remain limited (see outstanding questions). Importantly, the potential involvement of complement factors in protective immunity has been largely ignored for SARS-CoV-2, but has been defined with other viruses, bacteria, and protozoa. Results from small studies of complement inhibitor therapeutics should not overshadow the potential to harness the beneficial activities of complement. The implications for antibody-complement interactions in virus neutralization and immunity need to be investigated and could be applied to antibody-based therapeutics or active vaccination strategies against SARS-CoV-2.

f4d88dacdf8fc295a30bc387dc240944fa307633,Characterization of cell-cell communication in COVID-19 patients,"healthy human lung scRNA-seq datasets (4, 26, 27) including 189,967 cells and 44 cell types. For the Chua dataset with 5 healthy controls, 14 moderate and 13 severe samples ( Supplementary Fig. 1A-B) , scClassify is able to identify additional cell types and provide further refinement as illustrated in Fig.   1C . For example, the original ""outliers epithelial"" cluster was refined to ""ciliated cells"", and ""secretory"" cells to ""goblet"" cells. By accounting for such refinement, the new annotation recapitulates 78% of the original published analysis. The classified cell types are clearly identified by known markers (Supplementary Fig. 1C) , and further clustering of the Chua dataset generates 50 subclusters.Similar reannotation is applied to the Liao dataset (Supplementary Fig. 2A-B ) resulting in 15 cell types and 52 subclusters.To identify cell-cell interaction (CCI) differences with respect to disease severity in each dataset, we calculate the CCI scores that represent the communication probabilities among all pairs of subclusters across all ligand-receptor pairs (see Materials and Methods for details). Our group-specific CCI scores (CCI group ) aggregate the scores across all different pathways between each major cell type pair for different disease severity groups, represented as a network graph with thicker edges indicating stronger cell-cell interaction. Our results highlight that in healthy controls, most cell-cell interactions are between basal, ciliated, and goblet cells of the lung epithelium, with dendritic cells providing immune surveillance ( Fig. 2A) . As disease severity increases, cell-cell interactions become dominated by interactions between the lung epithelium and proinflammatory players within the immune compartment ( Fig. 2A-C, Supplementary Fig. 3A-E) . Overall, we observe significantly less communication (fewer edges in Fig. 2A ) in healthy individuals compared to moderate (Fig. 2B ) and severe patients (Fig. 2C ).We next study the cell-cell interaction in all three datasets (18, 28, 29) . Applying our developed workflow, we unified the annotation across all three datasets ( Supplementary Fig. 4A ). We used the Wilk dataset (with 44,721 cells and 20 cell types) as a reference (28) to reannotate the cell types for the Zhang dataset and the Arunachalam dataset. Cells with the same annotation were well integrated with scMerge (30) (Supplementary Fig. 4A) , indicating that similar cell types exist in the three studies. We observe distinct cell type compositions of these three studies, potentially due to different sampling or cell isolation procedures ( Supplementary Fig. 4B ). In all three PBMC studies, we observe that in monocyte-related interactions, COVID-19 patients generally have more cell-cell interactions than healthy controls (Supplementary Fig. 5A -C). The results across all five datasets suggest that cell type composition alone from single-cell experiments may not sufficiently discriminate between patients with different disease severity. This, along with the varying cell-cell interaction patterns across disease groups supports the further examination of the association between cell-cell interaction with disease outcomes and progression.Focusing on immune cell interactions in the upper airway, we observe different cell type interaction patterns across patients with different disease severity (Fig. 2D, Supplementary Fig. 3F ) in the Chua dataset. Compared to moderate patients, severe patients have less T cell to T cell interaction (illustrated by the thick blue edge on the T cell node in Fig. 2D ) and more macrophage to macrophage interaction (marked by thick red edge on the macrophage node in Fig. 2D ). Between different cell types, we see higher interactions between monocyte/macrophage or T cells towards neutrophils in severe patients, consistent with previous findings (31) . Similar patterns are observed in the Liao dataset where T cell to T cell interaction was higher in moderate patients, while interactions involving neutrophils and monocytes increased in severe patients ( Supplementary Fig. 2C ).The enrichment of monocyte dominated interactions in severe patients is also observed in all three PBMC datasets ( Supplementary Fig. 5D-F) . Interestingly, two of the PBMC datasets (Zhang and Arunachalam) illustrate that severe patients have a decrease in CD8 memory T cell interactions. The lack of T cell interactions in severe patients suggests potential T cell depletion, a finding supported by previous studies that lymphopenia is associated with severe disease (32) (33) (34) . Together, these data provide validation that our workflow can confirm known mechanisms and highlight new biology for further investigation.Focusing on individual pathways, Fig. 3A illustrates that all pathways can be broadly grouped into six large clusters. In particular, two of these pathway-clusters (pathway-cluster 2 marked by orange and pathway-cluster 4 marked by pink) are dominated by inflammatory pathways and these have significantly higher interaction between monocytes and neutrophils in severe patients compared to moderate ( Fig. 3A-B) . This is consistent with findings that in the productive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, alveolar macrophages recognize and phagocytize apoptotic cells; however, under a dysfunctional immune response, excessive activation and accumulation of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils leads to the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines which then damages the lung and other organs (35, 36) .To further delineate differences between moderate and severe patients observed in Fig. 2D (shown by thick red edges between monocytes and neutrophils), we investigated which subpopulations of monocytes actively interact with neutrophils ( Supplementary Fig. 6A-B) . The two inflammatory pathway-clusters mentioned above show that different cellular subtypes of monocytes in severe patients have significantly higher interaction scores in different pathways (Fig. 3B ). More specifically, we found that in severe patients, cellular subtype ""monocyte 1"" interacts with neutrophils through IL1, and CCL pathways, whereas interactions in moderate patients are dominated instead by TNF. Supplementary Fig. 6C -D shows that ""monocyte 1"" is marked by genes IL1B, IL1RN, IL8, TNFRSF1B and CCL4 and characterized by gene ontology terms ""regulation of inflammatory response"" as well as ""regulation of apoptotic signaling pathways"". The cellular subtype ""monocyte 2"" (marked by highly expressed IFI27), interacts primarily with neutrophils through pathways ANNEXIN and GALECTIN, which could suggest a role for this cluster in phagocytizing dying neutrophils. The cellular subtype ""monocyte 3"" expressing IFIT2, IFIT3, CCL8, CXCL10, and CXCL11 shows strong signatures of type 1 interferon cell-cell signaling ( Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. 6C ), suggesting equal support for antiviral immunity in moderate and severe patients. Alternatively, proinflammatory signaling via CXCL interactions is mainly through cellular subtype ""monocyte 4"", which highly expresses CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL5 ( Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. 6C ). over time (Fig. 3C) . Interestingly, ANNEXIN downregulates across time in severe patients, but increases in moderate patients (Fig. 3C) .We observe heterogeneous interaction patterns from goblet cells to immune cells across patients and pathways (Fig. 4A ). Goblet cells are found to express high levels of genes associated with innate and antiviral immune functions indicating that the nasal epithelial cells interacting with immune cells may play an important role in reducing early viral load and this is also consistent with recent literature (37) .We observe one subgroup of severe patients (n = 3; including one deceased patient) showing clear differences in cell-cell interaction within the pathway-cluster 1 compared to moderate patients. In particular, they show a lack of interaction in the collection of pathways which includes immune signaling and costimulation pathways such as CD40, CD80, CD23 and CD86 inflammatory pathways IL6, IFN-II, and Th2 cytokines IL-4/IL10 (Fig. 4A ). Another subgroup of severe patients (n = 6) show clusters with a small subgroup of moderate patients that has low cell-cell interaction for antigen presentation (MHC-II), signaling pathways PTN and NPR2, and this subgroup is also lacking the Th2 cytokine IL-4 and the B cell activating factor BAFF (Fig. 4A ). Together, these results point to cohort heterogeneity within severe patients implicating immune costimulation or T cell polarizing pathways may contribute to disease severity with context.Focusing on a specific cellular subtype of epithelial cells (goblet 5), we observe a number of increased activities in moderate patients in the ANNEXIN pathway. This is most evident between cellular subtypes ""goblet 5"" and ""monocyte 5"". This epithelial to immune cell interaction within the ANNEXIN pathway also shows an increase in patients under moderate conditions (Fig. 4B ). Annexin plays a role in phagocytic uptake of dying cells, can drive neutrophil detachment and apoptosis, and plays a predominant role in immune resolution (38) . Remarkably, glucocorticoids, which are effective at treating COVID-19 patients, act via upregulating Annexin I (39), suggesting that natural moderate symptoms for COVID-19 may be linked to effective endogenous immune management, or that patients that respond to glucocorticoid drugs elevate Annexin cell communication pathways that then limit further inflammation, and this response is detectable via single-cell analysis. We have developed and provide an interactive resource (http://shiny.maths.usyd.edu.au/CovidCellInteraction/) to enable further investigation of cell-cell interaction at different resolutions from aggregate interaction between two major cell types to visualize expression values for specific ligand-receptor pairs.Finally, we found that information from cell-cell interactions provides a discriminating signal for patients with different disease progression. Table 1 ). The accuracy rate of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) based on the first three PCs using k nearest neighbor classification (k = 3)is 84.4%, highlighting the ability of cell-cell interaction features to predict the degree of severity of patients. By repeating our workflow on the three PBMC datasets, we further demonstrate that using CCI features can achieve higher LOOCV accuracy rate than using cell type composition as features.Despite the limited samples, repeating our workflow on a smaller dataset within BALF tissues in the Liao dataset demonstrates similar findings that cell-cell communication patterns between goblet cells to immune cells has potential discriminating power.A better understanding of virus and host cell interaction at the cellular level is an important component in understanding infectious disease progression and is critical for developing a treatment for the disease. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive workflow to integrate and examine multiple COVID-19 single-cell RNA-seq datasets to identify differential cell-cell interaction (CCI) pathways with respect to disease. Our initial results in upper airway tissues show strong intra-epithelial communication in the healthy lung, whereas the immune system then dominates communication pathways during COVID-19. We then discover that despite a higher cell-cell interaction (tCCI score) in severe patients compared to moderate patients between immune and neutrophil cells, the CCI scores between epithelial and immune cells are heterogeneous among severe patients, with a subpopulation illustrating lower CCI score when compared to moderate patients. Furthermore, features extracted from cell-cell interactions are potential signatures for discriminating between moderate and severe patients.In most multi-omics profiling in patients with COVID-19, strong acute inflammatory responses are commonly found in most of the cell types as expected. Since the airway epithelium is the primary site of infection for SARS-CoV-2 causing disease, investigating how epithelial cells interact with immune cells differentially leads to a better understanding of the initial host reaction to viral infection. Therefore, examining cell-cell communication offers an analytical approach to characterize specific cell type interaction and identify potential immune response drivers that results in different degrees of disease severity.The importance of using a workflow that accounts for cohort heterogeneity in examining severe and moderate patients is clearly illustrated when we examine the interaction pattern between nasal epithelium as a ligand and various receptors in immune cells. This is a different approach to the one taken by Chua and colleagues (25) , where they measure the overall/aggregate interaction between epithelial and immune cells and found a higher overall/aggregate interaction between epithelial and immune cells in severe patients. Here, when we examine the cell-cell interaction relationships at the individual sample level, we observe clear cohort heterogeneity among severe patients, and we are able to discover a subgroup of the moderate patients with higher interaction between epithelial and immune cells.In this study, we focus on the cell communication within COVID-19 patients via ligand-receptor signaling. Several methods have been developed recently to infer such cell-cell interaction from scRNA-seq data, such as CellPhoneDB, SingleCellSignalR, NicheNet and CellChat (20) (21) (22) 40) . Most of these methods aim to identify the significant ligand and receptor gene pair between two cell populations with the most recent method CellChat (22) that accounts for additional signaling factors.In addition, CellChat systematically categorizes the ligand-receptor pairs based on their signaling pathways, providing a comprehensive interpretation of cell-cell communication from single-cell RNAseq. There are also other types of cell communication like physical cell interaction that can be further investigated. Technology to sequence physically interacting cells like PIC-seq has been used to investigate epithelial-immune interaction and infectious disease in mice (41) . Application of such technology in COVID-19 research will potentially allow characterization of differential physical intercellular interaction at high resolution.Our analysis suggests the heterogeneity of cell-cell interaction patterns within patients, even if they have similar degrees of symptoms. One key variability is the sampling time since the onset of symptoms, as this may not fully capture the true underlying disease progression within each individual.Other potential factors that lead to the variability include age, gender, comorbidities and viral load.Currently, with the limited number of samples from patients with similar clinical characteristics, accounting for these uncertainties in modelling is challenging. Towards the future, as more large single-cell profiling resources in COVID-19 become publicly available, integrative analysis and metaanalysis of these studies by incorporating patient diversity to our workflow will provide a more comprehensive characterization of cell-cell interaction patterns in COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, using the current databases our workflow supports that cell-cell interactions provide more meaningful predictions of disease progression ( Figure 4C ).In summary, our novel workflow enables integrative analysis of five different COVID-19 scRNA-seq data sets with a total of 415,856 cells and 85 samples. This generalizable workflow was built on the latest single-cell analytical methods and enables the identification of differential cell-cell interaction across disease progression. We discover clear cohort heterogeneity among the severe patients in the interaction between epithelial and immune cells, with signatures that can be linked with patient outcome. Together we provide a validated workflow for integration and analysis of diverse single-cell sequencing data to pinpoint communication networks that control disease outcome. [C] Wilk dataset -The raw count matrices of single-cell RNA-seq data from PBMC with metadata were downloaded from the COVID-19 Cell Atlas: https://www.covid19cellatlas.org/#wilk20 (28) . This data contains 6 healthy controls, 3 moderate patients and 4 severe patients.[D] Arunachalam dataset -The raw count matrices of single-cell RNA-seq data from PBMC and the clinical information were downloaded from GEO under accession number GSE155673. This data has 5 healthy controls, 3 moderate patients and 4 severe patients (29) . The cells with more than 20% mitochondrial proportion and UMI count greater than 50,000 are removed from the downstream analysis.[E] Zhang dataset -The raw sequence files of single-cell RNA-seq data from PBMC are downloaded from the Genome Sequence Archive of the Beijing Institute of Genomics (BIG) Data Center, BIG, Chinese Academy of Science using the accession code HRA000150 (18) . Cell Ranger (v3.0.2) with human reference version GRCh38 were used to generate the raw count matrices. The data includes 5 healthy controls, 7 moderate patients and 4 severe patients. Only the cells retained from the original study are used.Processing: For each dataset, we performed size factor standardization and log transformation on the raw count expression matrices using the logNormCount function in the R package scater (version 1.16.2) and generated log transformed gene expression matrices for analysis.Step 1 -Cell type annotation -For a given dataset, we perform a cell type identification using the scClassify framework (19) . Specifically, to identify the cell types from the Chua dataset and the Liao dataset, we performed a modified version of the joint classification from scClassify that incorporates the concept of iterative supervised learning. The initial model is built from four reference datasets including annotated cell information from healthy human lungs (4, 26, 27) . The final cell type labels were determined by the majority vote from individual classification labels using each single reference. An additional scClassify model based on the assigned cells was then built to predict the cells that are classified as ""intermediate"" or ""unassigned"" in the previous step. To identify cell types from the PBMC datasets, we used the Wilk dataset as a reference (28) to build the model and use it to predict the cell types for the Zhang dataset and the Arunachalam dataset. To prevent over clustering, we follow a similar workflow described in clusterExperiment to collapse the identified subclusters (23) . Hierarchical clustering is first performed on the aggregated average expression of each subcluster to construct a cluster hierarchy, and then from the bottom to top, the clusters of the same branches are merged if less than 10 genes are differentially expressed (log fold change > 1, FDR < 0.01). Note that we identified some cellular subtypes (ionocytes and squamous) that are inconsistently annotated between the original Chua dataset and scClassify (classified as goblet cells). In this instance, based on marker expression, we manually reannotated these two cell types using the original annotation for the downstream analysis.For a given individual sample and a pair of subclusters (i.e. cellular subtypes) obtained in Step 2, we calculate the aggregated ligand-receptor interaction score based on CellChat (22) The implementation is available as R code stored at the GitHub, https://github.com/SydneyBioX/COVID_CCI_analysis and as a web shiny application at http://shiny.maths.usyd.edu.au/CovidCellInteraction/.The output of the cell-cell interaction analysis can be considered as a three-dimensional array representing the cell-cell interaction (CCI) score. Let !""# denote the cell-cell interaction (CCI) score generated from the computational workflow for a pair of cellular subtypes , where ∈ (defined below as a set consisting of all pairs of cellular subtypes), pathway with = 1, . . . , , and individual sample with = 1, . . . , . In general, an individual sample represents the sample from one individual collected at a specific time point.For major cell types, we denote them by the sets $ , % , . . . , & and within a given major cell type ' consisting of ' cellular subtypes '$ , '% , . . . , '( ! we can write ' = { ') | = 1, . . . , ' }. We can represent a pair of cellular subtypes as = 6 ') , *+ 7, where , = 1, . . . , ; = 1 , . . , ' and = 1, . . . , * . Here, we consider ') as the sender cellular subtype within major cell type ' and *+ as the receiver cellular subtype from major cell type * . The collection of all pairs of cellular subtypes is written as = <6 '), *+ 7| , = 1, . . . , ; = 1, . . . , ' ; = 1, . . . , * =. We further denote -! ,-"" as a subset of containing only pairs of cellular subtypes from major cell type ' to * which isFor a given sample , the following measures of interest are explored:• Subtype cell-cell interaction (sCCI) between a pair of cellular subtypes for an individual sample is calculated as sCCI ( , )= @ !""# "" . This measure totals the cell-cell interaction score across all pathways. Calculating this score for each pair of cellular subtypes and each individual sample is the same as totaling the array across the pathways resulting in a | | × two-dimensional matrix.• Pathway specific cell-cell interaction (pCCI) from the major cell type ' to the major cell type * for a pathway and an individual sample is pCCI 6 ' , * , , 7 = @where -! ,-"" is defined as above. This is a measure that sums the cell-cell interaction scores across all cellular subtypes between any two major cell types. For each pair of ( ' , * ), calculating this statistic for each pathway and individual sample results in a × matrix (see Figure 3A ).• Total CCI (tCCI) from major cell type ' to major cell type * for an individual sample is defined as tCCI6 ' , * , 7= F @ x !""# "" = ∑ sCCI( , ), where -! ,-"" is defined as above. This is a measure that sums the cell-cell interaction scores across all cellular subtypes between two major cell types and across all pathways. For each individual sample , calculating the tCCI statistic for each pair of ( ' , * ) will result in a × matrix that can be visualized as a heatmap or network graph.• Suppose represents a set of pathways belonging to the same cluster termed as a pathwaycluster (see Clustering in Methods). The pathway-cluster cell-cell interaction for an individual sample between a pair of cellular subtypes is defined as psCCI( , , )=We calculate a group specific cell-cell interaction (CCI group ) between two cellular subtypes where groups represent any treatment of interest. Here it refers to control and disease progression such as moderate and severe patients. Let group denote a set of individual samples under the same condition of interest, where | group | indicates the size of the set. For example, the total number of samples having moderate response to COVID-19 in the dataset (see Fig. 2 A-C). The CCI group from the major cell types ' to the major cell types * can be calculated by#∈ group , where ( ) = 3456'((4)9 36:;(4)56'((4)9 is a scaling function to scale between individual samples. In practice, the differential CCI from ' to * between moderate (CCI moderate ) and severe (CCI severe ) patients can be calculated by CCI severe − CCI moderate measuring the differential patterns of the cell-cell interaction across different disease severity (see Figure 2D ).The pathway-cluster cell-cell interaction (used in Figure 3B ) for a group of individuals ℒ between a pair of cellular subtypes is simply the sums of psCCI across individual with a group ℒ and can be written as. For a pair of cellular subtypes , calculating this statistic results in a | | × | group | matrix.Suppose we have multiple samples collected from the same individual at different time points, say early and late then the cell-cell interaction across disease progression is the log-ratio of cell-cell interaction (illustrated in Fig. 3C ) between these two time points for a given pair of cell types (sender cell type ' , receiver cell types * within a pathway is log SpCCI6 ', * , late 7/pCCI6 ', * , early 7T.We group various pathways based on the similarity of intercellular communication patterns using hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance and ward.D2 agglomerative method implemented in the function hclust in R.We integrate the three PBMC datasets using a modified version of scMerge (30) . Here, cell types annotated by scClassify are used as an input to scMerge to construct pseudo-bulk expression profiles.The resulting profiles are used to identify mutual nearest subgroups as pseudo-replicates and to estimate parameters of the scMerge model.To select the cell-cell interaction features that discriminate across samples under different conditions, we performed a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test on pathway-specific cell-cell interaction (pCCI) to select the pathways that are significantly different across samples from healthy controls, moderate patients and severe patients. Feature selection is based on pCCI features with an adjusted p-value less than 0.1 for the Chua dataset, less than 0.2 for the Wilk and Zhang datasets and less than 0.4 for the Arunachalam dataset, we termed these selected features as ""Top CCI"". For the Chua dataset, we also selected the top pCCI from the cell-cell interaction between the two major epithelial cell types (Goblet and Ciliated) and the immune cell types (B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes and T cells), termed as ""Epi-Immune CCI"". We further considered cell type proportion as another type of feature.The classification model to predict the samples' condition is built with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and random forest (RF) on the selected features (Top CCI, Epi-Immune CCI, and cell type proportion) as well as k nearest neighbor classification (with k = 1, 3) using the first 3 principal components of the pCCI matrix. The classification performance was determined by leave-one-out cross-validation.Differential gene expressions were identified using moderated t-statistics implemented in the R package limma (version 3.44.3). The gene set over-representation analysis for the significant DE genes (top 100 genes selected) with biological process (BP) gene ontology is measured using the ""enrichGO"" function in the R package clusterProfiler (version 3.16.0) (43) . Significant GO term is defined by q-value < 0.1.To facilitate the interpretation of the complex data set, we have created an online interactive tool which allows researchers to explore different parts of the data. The first tab of the tool contains four columns.The first column allows the user to select two groups (or individual samples) to compare and it displays the associated cell-cell interaction network. The second column shows the difference between ",Australia,first author,2020-12-30,12

We evaluated multiple extraction and PCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.We included 65 positive samples which were run on the Panther Fusion using a laboratory developed test (LDT, E gene target). Where viral RNA was extracted by MagNA Pure (MP) 96 extraction platform or EpMotion 5075/Geneaid extraction kit, SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed on Light Cycler (LC) 480 using a LDT (E gene) or 3 commercial assays; Certest Viasure (Orf1ab, N genes) GenePro (E, RdRp genes) and A* Star Fortitude (proprietary target).Median Cts on LC 480 LDT for specimens (n = 9) extracted on MP 96 (26.6) were lower than on EpMotion (31.6) whereas median Cts for specimens (n = 10) extracted on the Panther Fusion LDT (23.1) were comparable with MP 96 /LC480 LDT (23.6).Specimens tested on Panther Fusion LDT (n = 28), extracted by MP 96, and amplified using commercial assays showed good concordance with a few exceptions; lower median Ct values were seen for 2 targets on GenePro (16.9, 21.5) and Viasure (19.5, 21 .1) than for the Panther Fusion LDT (24.2) and A* Star Fortitude (25.6).Specimens tested on MP 96 (n = 18) had comparable results using commercial assays, with lower median Cts for Viasure (22.2, 23 .7) compared with the LC 480 LDT (24.7), GenePro (24.7,25.7) and A*Fortitude (25.1) assays.The study provides an early assessment of the performance characteristics of 3 extraction methods for viral RNA and 5 PCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 , an outbreak of respiratory illness that originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has infected over 9 million people globally to date (Johns Hopkins University, 2020). Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 include fever, cough, shortness of breath, coryzal symptoms and anosmia (Harapan et al., 2020) . Molecular detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the diagnostic benchmark for the diagnosis of acute COVID infection (Anon., 2020).The New Zealand government's COVID-19 elimination strategy requires testing individuals who meet a broad suspect case definition, which from 1 April 2020 included anyone with mild symptoms of an acute respiratory tract infection (NZ Government, 2020) . The broad criteria for testing have contributed to high testing rates per population in NZ, peaking, to date, in excess of 7000 tests per day (1.4 tests per 1000 population per day). The inherent challenges of processing daily high specimen numbers with a short turn-around-time (TAT) are exacerbated by the unprecedented global demand for molecular reagents, and deterioration of international transport links which occurred over a matter of days from March 2020. As a solution, in NZ, multiple high-throughput extraction and PCR platforms were engaged simultaneously for SARS-CoV-2 RNA extraction and RT-PCR to circumvent these constraints and to achieve optimal TAT from sample collection to result delivery in order to support diagnosis and public health activities for individuals tested in hospital and the community (Verrall, 2020) . We present evaluations of the different RNA extraction strategies, commercial and laboratory developed tests (LDT) for RT-PCR undertaken at Auckland Hospital laboratory, LabPLUS, during the pandemic. This evaluation included 65 samples from which SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was initially detected by Light Cycler (LC) 480 LDT or the Panther Fusion LDT (Fig 2) . The clinical specimens and the extracted RNA were stored at 4 • C and the evaluation was performed within a week unless otherwise noted. The samples included 58 patient samples in Universal Transport Media (Fort Richard Laboratories, New Zealand) , all of which were upper respiratory tract swabs and 7 external quality assurance program (QAP) samples [3 PCR positive from WHO CDC QAP and 4 PCR positive from RCPA QAP] . The information about matrix of the QAP specimens was not available at the time. The volume provided in the QAP specimens allowed for only one extraction, hence MP 96 extraction and RT-PCR amplification by the LC 480 LDT or the commercial PCR kits.The MagNA Pure (MP) 96 semi-automated extraction platform (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Pleasanton, CA, US) was used for viral RNA extraction. The EpMotion 5075 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), liquid handling workstation was programmed for high-throughput viral RNA extraction using viral DNA/RNA kit from Geneaid (Geneaid Biotech, Taiwan), as part of the diversification strategy to address the bottle-neck at the RNA extraction step (Fig. 1) . Table 1 provides the details of the viral RNA extraction and PCR cycling parameters with five different platforms for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in clinical specimens. Briefly, for both MP 96 RNA and EpMotion 5075/ Geneaid viral DNA/RNA kit extraction, 200 μl of respiratory specimens (oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs in universal transport medium) were pretreated with 100 μl MagNA Pure 96 External Lysis Buffer (Roche) followed by incubation for 10 min at 72 ̊C . Following further addition of 2 μl RNA internal extraction control (Bioline, London, UK) and 5 μl carrier RNA (Qiagen), the specimens underwent high-throughput automated extraction.We compared the different extraction methods and PCR kits targeting different genes by analysis of the median cycle threshold (Ct) values, the delta Ct (difference between Ct values) and the interquartile ranges (IQR).Amplification of the Sarbeco E gene of SARS-CoV-2 using a LDT (Corman et al., 2020) was performed on the LC 480 (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Pleasanton, CA, US). Commercial PCR kits obtained from Fig. 1 . below shows box plots comparing the cycle threshold, Ct using the LDT Light Cycler 480 [n = 9] when specimens were extracted using MagNAPure 96 extraction versus when specimens were extracted using EpMotion 5075/Geneaid Viral RNA extraction kit. Nine specimens extracted on MP 96 extraction with a median Ct of 26.6 (interquartile range, IQR 23.3-28) had a higher median Ct of 31.6 (IQR 29.1-33.8) when extracted on the EpMotion 5075/Geneaid Viral RNA extraction kit and amplified using the LDT on the LC 480. . Three out of the 10 specimens were tested on the EpMotion were stored at 4 • C for longer than 1 week. Ten specimens processed on the MP 96/LC 480 using the LDT with a median Ct of 23.6 (IQR 17.5-27.6) had comparable results on the Panther Fusion LDT with a median Ct of 23.1 (IQR 18.4-27.9) for the same samples.alternate supply chains for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were also evaluated. Viasure SARS-CoV-2 Real Time PCR Detection Kit (Certest Biotec SL, Spain) targets a conserved region of ORF1ab and N genes for SARS-CoV-2 developed based on the sequences published by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and comes in a multiplexed single tube format where the primer/probes and master mixes are lyophilised in PCR tubes. The PCR with Viasure kits were evaluated on the Viasure PCR machine. The two other commercial kits evaluated were A*STAR Fortitude Kit 2.0 (MiRXES, Singapore) with a proprietary gene target, and GenePro PCR kit (Gencurix, Korea) kit which targets the E-gene and the RdRp genes in two single-plexed reaction. Both were run on the ABI 7500 real-time PCR [Applied Biosystems]. We analysed of the median cycle threshold (Ct) values, the delta Ct (difference between Ct values) and the interquartile ranges (IQR) for comparison.The Panther Fusion platform (Hologic, San Diego, CA) which incorporates the RNA extraction and RT-PCR steps was also employed for testing. Amplification of the Sarbeco E gene of SARS-CoV-2 using the same LDT described above (Corman et al., 2020) The delta Ct of <3.5 cycles between median Cts over the different assays indicates comparable performance though neither of the GenePro targets were detected in 3 clinical specimens that were detected by all other platforms, with LC 480 LDT Cts of 24.65, 30, and 30. Among the QAP specimens, 1 specimen was detected by LC480 LDT and GenePro RdRp gene only while a second QAP specimen was detected on all platforms but not by LC480 LDT and GenePro RdRp gene. The results of the QAP were not available at the time of submission of this article.Rapid scale-up of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing capacity by utilising diverse platforms and assays has formed one of the pillars in New Zealand's COVID-19 response. Accordingly we evaluated multiple extraction and PCR platforms and assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.There were both logistical and technical advantages and disadvantages to the extraction platforms. The MP 96 reagents used for RNA extraction were initially in short supply due to high demands during this pandemic. An advantage of the EpMotion liquid handling workstation is that it does not require proprietary reagents and plasticware and hence the extraction kits could be sourced locally. A second advantage of the EpMotion liquid handling workstation is the flexibility to program and automate the required steps for an extraction run. We note the higher median Ct values in the EpMotion 5075 extraction with the Geneaid viral extraction kit, compared with the MP 96 platform, though the upper ranges were comparable, with a delta Ct <3 cycles. It is possible that the EpMotion with the Geneaid viral extraction kit could contribute to reduced detection of low viral loads and this warrants further study.A*Fortitude kits supplied the reverse transcriptase reagent and the Taq polymerase in the kit and hence did not need to be sourced separately at the time of reagent scarcity. The mastermixes in the Viasure kits are supplied in lyophilised form in PCR tubes and only need reconstitution with a supplied rehydration buffer and addition of extracted RNA before running the PCR amplification step. These kits include two targets in a multiplexed reaction. GenePro kit also provided reverse transcriptase reagent and the Taq polymerase but unlike the other commercial kits lacked an internal control and had two single-plex targets which required additional wells to be used on the plate, limiting the number of samples per plate significantly. It also failed to detect higher number of positive samples than those detected on other platforms.The advantages of commercial assays are offset by additional reagent cost, and under current circumstances, significant potential supply issues, where companies drip-feed supplies which are subject to postponement or cancellation without notice. To overcome these issues in NZ, the Ministry of Health sourced A*Fortitude kits direct from Singapore in bulk, which are stored and distributed centrally in NZ to overcome short-term supply issues.The Panther LDT allows random access testing and offers a shorter turn-around-time to results compared with the non-integrated platforms, and in theory has the capacity to test >1000 samples in a 24 period, but some of the reagents and consumables such as the external lysis tubes are proprietary and remain in short supply in NZ, so the potential of this platform has been unfulfilled, and our machine often idles, awaiting the next shipment of reagents.The study provides an early assessment of the performance characteristics of 3 extraction methods for viral RNA and 5 different PCR kits with different gene targets for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. During the current pandemic, the LDT and commercial assays examined here had acceptable performance criteria for testing such as each specimen well was positive for the internal control to check for PCR inhibition or no target signals detected in both the negative template control and extraction control or the positive template control lies within 2 cycles above or below the accepted Ct value. This evaluation equipped us with wider options for the ongoing testing of the SARS-CoV-2 specimens after the NZ alert levels are lifted and the testing numbers expected to increase.The authors report no declarations of interest.

657c22f4d341fc0094677d9c696a1e729ea1a872,Hand injuries during COVID-19: Lessons from lockdown,"Following the declaration by the World Health Organisation (WHO) that COVID-19 could be characterised as a global pandemic, Australia implemented a ban on the arrival of all non-residents and non-Australian citizens from March 20. A further nationwide shutdown on all non-essential services was implemented from midday March 23, with the closure of places of social gathering, including clubs, entertainment venues and eat-in restaurants, as well as social distancing guidelines. These restrictions remained in place until May 15, when limitations were relaxed to allow gatherings of 10 people, the re-opening of cafes and restaurants for sitin dining and the return to work for many non-essential industries.The intervening 2-month shutdown necessitated a marked change in the time spent at home versus in the workplace as industries classified as non-essential transitioned to work-from-home policies, or closed entirely. A number of recent studies have noted a resultant alteration in the distribution of presentations for acute hand and orthopaedic trauma, with an increase in certain injury types such as do-it-yourself (DIY) injuries. 1 , 2 Hand trauma, in particular, produces significant direct and indirect healthcare costs owing to the ubiquity of the use of the hand in activities of daily living and vocation, making it an ideal target for preventative strategies to preserve increasingly scarce healthcare resources. [3] [4] [5] Given the possibility of future lockdowns related to COVID-19, this study aimed to analyse the change in the pattern of acute hand injuries during the COVID-19 shutdown period, and identify specific targets for preventative strategies during the ongoing pandemic.This study is a retrospective analysis of inpatient data for patients who were admitted under the hand surgery department at Sydney Hospital following acute presentations between March 23 and May 15 in 2019 and 2020. Sydney Hospital is the tertiary referral centre for hand injuries for the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District (SESLHD) and Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health Districts, and receives patients from the entire South Coast of New South Wales. Acute hand injuries from an adjacent hospital, Prince of Wales Hospital (POWH), were also redirected to Sydney Hospital during the lockdown period as part of a redistribution of services designed to expand capacity for potential COVID-19-related admissions.Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the SESLHD Human Research and Ethics low-negligible risk committee. Charts were reviewed for patient demographics, reason for admission, location of injury (workplace vs. nonworkplace), injury characteristics (mechanism and type of injury), management type (operative vs. non-operative), and length of stay. Workplace injuries were defined as those that were incurred during the course of paid employment and were sub-divided into high-energy machine-related injuries, and low-energy non-machine-related injuries. Mechanisms of injury were grouped into ten categories (DIY, animal bite, kitchen, domestic violence, workplace, fall, punch, sport, minor non-specific, and unknown) that were prospectively determined on the basis of previously publications on hand injury epidemiology. [6] [7] [8] Patients who underwent day-only procedures were classified as inpatients for the duration of their stay and so were included in the analysis, as were those who presented within the designated period and then discharged before undergoing their operation on a semi-elective basis (such as closed fractures). Patients who underwent elective operations or revision procedures for injuries sustained prior to the designated periods were excluded.Comparisons of baseline data between years for age and length of stay were completed using a simple T-test analysis. Chi-square tests were used for the remainder of the analyses in order to account for the categorical nature of the variables, with the differences in distribution among groups compared between years. All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS v.24, with a statistical significance level of 0.05.A total of 332 acute presentations requiring admission were identified during the lockdown period between March 15 and May 15 2020, and 310 cases were identified for the same period in 2019. Baseline demographic and treatment data were available for all 642 patients, and are presented by year in Table 1 . The mean patient age was higher in 2020 than in 2019 (42 and 39, respectively), as was the proportion of injuries that occurred in the workplace (26.5% and 20.3%). No difference was identified between 2020 and 2019 with regard to patient sex, length of stay, or management type -overall the majority of patients were male (70.2%), underwent operative management (97%), and were managed as day-only cases (mean LOS 0.8).A greater proportion of presentations were related to DIY injuries during the lockdown period than in the comparable period in 2019, with 64 cases recorded in 2020 and 15 in 2019, representing a 327% increase ( Table 2 ; Figure 1 ). The majority of DIY injuries in both years occurred in males (82.5% and 73.3%) in the 44-49-year-old age range. Injuries in the workplace were also predominantly in males, though in a younger population group, and the mean age of patients injured in non-machine related workplace incidents decreased between 2019 and 2020 (39 and 32, respectively). Injuries related to domestic violence increased, with five cases recorded in 2020 and zero in 2019, though there was no difference with respect to sex.The proportion of presentations related to punches and sport decreased in 2020 (by 54% and 100% respectively). Punch injuries had a significant male predominance in both years (96.2% and 91.7%), but there were no differences with respect to sex for sport. Non-specific injury mechanisms also decreased in 2020. No statistically significant differences were identified between 2020 and 2019 in the proportions of injuries related to dog or cat bites, kitchen injuries or falls.The results of this study indicate that the March-May COVID-19 lockdown period in 2020 was associated with a number of changes in the pattern of injuries relative to the same period in 2019. The most striking change was in the number of presentations related to DIY home maintenance injuries, which increased by 327% in 2020, with males in the 45-49year-age bracket making up the majority of patients -the major contributor to an increase in the overall patient age in 2020. This increase in household DIY injuries is in keeping with the findings from Hampton and Macdonald et al.[m6+; December 28, 2020; 8:11 ] and likely related to the increased time spent at home, as well as a potential reluctance to have professional tradespeople visit residences due to the perceived risk of disease transmission. 1 , 9 Despite this, injuries in the workplace increased in 2020, both in absolute terms (88 presentations vs. 63 in 2019) and as a proportion of the overall number of injuries (26.5% vs. 20.3). Although this is seemingly unintuitive, given the fact that the number of hours worked in Australia decreased by 9.5% overall, this finding is potentially reflective of a redistribution of workers into manual labour jobs with a higher risk of hand injuries. 10 Building work continued during the lockdown as it was considered an essential service, leading to a shift to paid manual labour among those who had previously been employed in other industries. Younger demographic groups are likely to have been over-represented in this group due to the shutdown of hospitality and arts industry-based employment in which they have traditionally been employed, with jobs in accommodation and food services decreasing by 40.8% in the 20-29-year age group in March and April 2020. 11 Our findings support this, as patients who sustained low-energy injuries at work were significantly younger in 2020 (32 vs. 39) than in 2019. This indicates that younger people, likely in short-term jobs, demonstrate a greater propensity to be injured at the worksite, and highlights the need for appropriate worksite training for workers prior to commencement of manual labour-based jobs.The finding that injuries related to domestic violence increased during the lockdown period is in keeping with a number of other recent publications, and is reflective of the need to be aware of the possibility of non-accidental injury, and to maintain resources to provide appropriate support in such cases at subspecialty hand units, which are often largely outpatient-centred. 12 , 13 The reduction in sport-related injuries is in keeping with expectations, given the complete shutdown of organised sporting activities. The decrease in punch-related presentations is likely to be a result of a reduction in interpersonal violence. Although Sydney did not have the formal curfew implemented in other cities, all bars, nightclubs, and large gatherings were closed, with a commensurate reduction in alcohol-related violence. The lower number of injuries related to minor 'non-specific' aetiologies in 2020 is likely to be reflective of the overall decrease in presentations to the emergency department for minor injuries that has been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. 14 The absolute numbers of dog/cat bites and kitchen-related injuries were higher in 2020 (35 vs. 22 and 47 vs. 36), as would be expected, given the increased time spent at home with pets and cooking, but the differences did not reach statistical significance.This study had a number of limitations. The most pertinent is related to the retrospective nature of the study and the inherent limitations that come with sourcing data from clinical notes. The exact nature of the mechanism of injury could occasionally not be identified, although every effort was made to address this, including retrieving ambulance records or off-site paper files. Specific details that would provide useful information in the context of our findings, such as the length of time that a patient had worked for their employer, were obviously not recorded. Future studies on hand trauma should prospectively record data related to the length of time in employment prior to injury, as well as the scope of worksite training or initiation. Another limitation relates to the fact that hand injuries from an adjacent hospital (POWH) were re-directed to Sydney Hospital during the COVID-19 lockdown. Although this increased the overall number of presentations slightly, it is unlikely to have significantly affected the pattern of presentations, given the relatively small number of patients transferred, and the fact that POWH is within the same local health district and so shares a similar patient population.This study therefore showed that the distribution of acute hand injuries during the COVID-19 lockdown period was reflective of changes in the pattern of activities undertaken both at home and in the workplace, particularly by people operating outside their usual scope of employment. A number of key areas that could be targeted in the event of future lockdowns include messages regarding safe DIY activities (or the availability of professional tradespeople in a COVID-safe manner), and specific requirements regarding worksite briefing and safety for people commencing labourbased jobs, especially if transferring from another industry.",Australia,abstract,2020-12-14,12

The COVID- 19 Wong et al., 2020). Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be measured in wastewater to detect and monitor SARS-CoV-2 infection trends among the population in an approach, previously utilized for poliovirus, and now known as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) (Paul et al., 1940; Asghar et al., 2014) . Importantly, levels of RNA shedding in stool are independent of COVID19 severity (Zheng et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in the stool despite negative clinical test results on nasopharyngeal swabs and is present in patient stool for a longer period (9-16 days post symptom onset, compared to 6-11 days in nasopharyngeal swabs); hence, monitoring stool may be useful when nasopharyngeal swab is negative . These observations suggest that WBE may afford a symptom clinically diagnosed cases in the country. Detections of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was also reported in Milan, Italy, within a few days of the first national clinical case (La ; in Brisbane, Australia, when the number of clinical cases in the region were in the hundreds (Ahmed et al. 2020a ); in secondary effluent in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, when reported cases were at their peak Interestingly, Medema and colleagues detected an RNA target associated with coronaviruses in wastewater from a city in the Netherlands six days before the first clinical cases were reported (Medema et al., 2020) , and another study from the northeastern USA reported that viral titers in wastewater indicated infections were significantly higher than those that were clinically detected . It is important to note that these studies measure fragments of viral RNA. While fecal transmission cannot be ruled out, SARS-CoV-2 in untreated wastewater were found to be not infective (Rimoldi et al., 2020) .Despite the flood of reported SARS-CoV-2 RNA detections in wastewater, little has been documented on the performance of virus concentration and detection methods (O""Reilly et al., 2020). A modeling exercise suggested that wastewater surveillance would theoretically be able to detect 1 shedder in a catchment of 2,000,000 people in the best case scenario, but noted limitations including uncertainties around RNA signal decay in wastewater, which have been shown to be dependent on temperatures and residence times en route to sampling points (Hart and Halden, 2020; Ahmed et al., 2020c; Ahmed et al., 2020d). Furthermore, 30-90% of infected individuals have reported shedding the virus accompanied by highly variable shedding rates (0.8 to 7.5 log 10 /g of feces). Therefore, predicting the number of shedders in a catchment may be difficult. A preprint has reported a detection limit of 1 shedder in 1,000 people to 2 shedders per strategies and direct public health intervention outcomes remains tenuous with the Water Research Foundation describing outbreak detection as ""very feasible"", outbreak tapering as ""somewhat feasible"", and prevalence assessment as ""may or may not be feasible"" (WRF, 2020).At present, the efficacy of WBE for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and monitoring has yet to be fully evaluated, and is limited by the short-term and cross-sectional nature of the published studies which often report RNA titers in wastewater during the exponential growth phase of an SARS-CoV-2 RNA is stable for days in untreated wastewater at temperatures ranging from 4 to 37°C, permitting reliable detection following sample collection and processing . These observations indicate that during a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the RNA signal in wastewater will likely build, plateau, and taper in distinct manners that will make interpretation of the signal challenging. The aim of this study was to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected and quantified in wastewater collected from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and to compare the frequency and variability of detection with COVID-19 case number data. We report a longitudinal study of SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantities in wastewater paired with clinical diagnoses of COVID-19 from 24/02/2020 to 01/05/2020 in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia during both the growth, plateau, and tapering of an epidemic of COVID-19 and compare this to the limited available data from other major Australian capital cities, Sydney and Melbourne; a Queensland regional centre, Townsville; two Queensland tourist areas, Cannonvale-Airlie Beach area of the Whitsundays and Hervey Bay; and a popular wine tourist region, the Barossa Valley in South Australia. Viruses were concentrated from these wastewater samples (100-200 mL based on turbidity) using adsorption-extraction with electronegative membrane as previously described (Ahmed et al., 2020a) . RNA was directly extracted from the electronegative membrane using a RNeasy PowerMicrobiome Kit ( Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with slight modification. A 2 mL glass bead beating tube was replaced with a 5-mL bead tube containing garnet beads. This was done to accommodate the electronegative membrane followed by adding 990 µL of buffer PM1 and 10 µL of β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Australia). A tissue homogenizer (Precellys 24, Bertin Technologies, France) was used to homogenize the samples, in which homogenization occurred for 3 × 20 s cycles at 10,000 rpm with a 10 s pause between cycles. Homogenization did not within 7 days of RNA extraction. Laboratory personnel wore personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, coats, safety glasses, face masks, and face shields during wastewater sample processing. Filtered wastewater samples were treated with 10% bleach and discarded in the sink as per the activity risk assessment for this project.Published RT-qPCR assays that target different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, specifically For each RT-qPCR run, a series of three positive and no template controls were included.All RT-qPCR data were generated using default settings for baseline and threshold. Data were only collected from instrument runs in which the positive control produced amplification, and no amplified product was observed in the no template control. All instrument runs passed these criteria. A master standard curve with 95% upper and lower confidence intervals was generated for each assay. The log 10 -linear regression of copy number and corresponding quantification cycle J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof (Cq) values (derived from the 6-point, assay gBlock 1:10 serial dilution series) measured in triplicate from three qPCR instrument runs were used to generate the master standard curve.For each sample replicate, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration (copies/reaction) was calculated from the master standard curve and accounts for the difference in nucleic acid type between the double-stranded oligonucleotide used to generate the standard curve and the singlestranded genome of SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., divide by 2) (Bustin et al., 2009). The assay limit of detection (ALOD) for the different assays used was defined as the minimum copy number with a 95% probability of detection as previously described (Verbyla et al., 2016) . The process limit of detection (PLOD) was calculated by dividing the ALOD by the RNA template volume added to the RT-qPCR well and then multiplying this number by the total volume of RNA extracted from each sample to yield the total RNA gene copies (GC). This number was then normalised to total sample volume processed to yield the PLOD of SARS-CoV-2 RNA GC/100 mL. Since an RNA sample still can yield RT-qPCR positive signal above the ALOD, we used a cut-off <45 Cq to determine positive samples.An experiment was conducted to determine the presence of PCR inhibition in nucleic acid extracted from wastewater samples using a murine hepatitis virus (MHV) RT-qPCR assay Woodcroft, unpublished, https://github.com/wwood/CoverM). Low quality read mappings were removed with CoverM ""filter"" (minimum identity 95% and minimum aligned length of 90%). Read depth profiles for each sample were calculated using samtools (ver. 1.9) to confirm coverage of the targeted region.Low risk approval as defined by the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research was obtained from CSIRO Ethics Committee (reference number 2020_035_LR).All RNA samples were free from PCR inhibition as determined by the MHV RT-qPCR assay and, were therefore, used for downstream RT-qPCR analysis without dilution (Supplementary Table   ST2 South area prior to the clinical testing of individuals being available or implemented widely ( Fig.   2A and Fig. 2C ). The decay of the 7-day average detections in mid-April (9 th to 21 st April, Fig. 2B) align with the decrease of active cases (Fig. 2C) , and may align with a 2-3 week lag in daily cases (24 th to 28 th March peak in daily cases vs peak of 7-day average detections, April 12 th ). As might be expected, the 7-day average wastewater detections tracked similarly to the 7-day average GC/100 mL; however, the GC/100 mL did not appear to agree well with daily case numbers ( Supplementary Fig. SF1 ). Unfortunately, active case numbers were only available from 9 th April, after the peak in daily cases, meaning there were only three days with data overlap with the quantified SARS-CoV-2 detections in wastewater. For those days the ratio of GC/100 mL to number of active cases were 1.7, 1.8, and 2.9. The current study immediately followed our proof-of-concept study, where we reported the  The observed prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in WWTP influent varied between wastewater catchments perhaps due to large differences in catchment size, pipe networks, wastewater characteristics, and subsequently, hydraulic retention times. Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is particularly useful for COVID-19 management, and will aid in health messaging, warnings, setting up pop-up testing clinics of individuals to detect and minimize potential second or third waves of the pandemic.

967629b66f6bc57db968738f798b43909d84ad35,"Nursing, masks, COVID-19 and change","long sought to undermine the division of people and things insisting instead that they be viewed 'symmetrically' (Murdoch, 1997) .Some ANT scholars went one step further by seeking to resolve the conceptual division between people and things by using the term 'actant' to represent their interdependence. For example, In his whimsical account entitled, 'Where are the missing masses... ', Latour (1992) described how actants are 'performed' in our everyday lives.The missing masses are, of course, 'things'. Latour (1992) describes, in detail, how 'mundane artefacts' such as the seatbelt of a car or a photocopier steers human action. Another social scientist describes the relationship between persons and things as paradoxical, as an 'intersection between unity and division: one serves as the locus where the other is put into effect' (Esposito, 2015, p. 8) . But unlike ANT scholars, rather than a assuming semiotic approach, Esposito (2015) argues instead that the only way to resolve the division between people and things is to view it from the perspective of the body. The body, he suggests, should be seen as 'the unique locus where our individual and collective experiences are united' (p.10), as both the object and subject of power and the site of competing, perhaps oppositional, interests, culminating in either inclusive or exclusive consequences.The utility of these theorizations is that they move us beyond the absolutism of modernist medical thinking and the intellectual straight jacketing that occurs with the slavish adherence to binaries such as people and things. We are reminded instead to explore the specificity and every day-ness of any given situation in which people and things 'perform' to produce particular relational effects.For example, some state authorities in Australia have made wearing masks mandatory and those found not wearing a mask are fined.Women who routinely wear the burqa have reported how widespread wearing of masks brought a new and unanticipated sense of inclusion (Booth et al., 2020) . Conversely, in the UK, people with hearing-impairment have called for transparent masks to be made more readily available to overcome exclusion they experience due to communication difficulties brought about by wearing masks that make it impossible to lip read.Today, for many of us, living together in the presence of COVID-19, means wearing a mask, which both enables people to continue to relate while at the same time remaining separate. Wearing a mask represents the dual risk and mutual obligation to ourselves, of not becoming infected and/or of spreading the infecting in the community. For example, in public health advertisements on Australian television, repeated use of the pronouns 'you' and 'we' help to emphasize shared risk and responsibility-'Staying apart keeps us together' (Inspector General for Emergency Management, 2020), as long as you wear a mask. Here, the 'table analogy' coined by Arendt and Canovan (1959, p. 52 ) might be used to sum up by way of metaphor, how human relations are mediated and manipulated by things to create paradoxical, even ambiguous relational effects such as those characterized by the above public health slogan.'To live together in the world means essentially that a world of things is between those who have it in common, as a table is located between those who sit around it; the world, like every in-between, relates and separates men at the same time'.COVID-19 has become the common enemy, which requires that we continue to relate in order to overcome it. Epidemiological implications aside, masks are actants performed which become not only barriers to disease but symbols of the mutual obligations to one and all in combating the disease.In 2020, mask-wearing in response to COVID-19 serves as a proxy for the transformation alluded to, but not elaborated by Napier (1986) . Transformation is necessary to resolve paradox of having to 'stay together while remaining apart'; however, the full extent of the transformations invoked by COVID-19 and the many more that are to come are incomprehensible. These transformations must not be viewed as wholly negative despite the association of mask-wearing with menace, demons and disease. In their book, 'The Human Condition', Arendt and Canovan (1959, p. 47) remind us of: 'The miracle that saves the world, the realm of human affairs, from its normal, ""natural"" ruin is ultimately the fact of natality…' For Arendt, natality encapsulates the ways in which people are able to begin again and to reinvent.The question is, how and what will nurses' and nursing reinvent and begin again in the wake of COVID-19? And will these new beginnings seek out those 'mundane artifacts' (Latour, 1992) that help shape and are shaped by nurses and their practice?Personal protective equipment (PPE) in general, and face masks in particular, can and should be seen as a caring act in that it aims to protect others from droplets and sources of infection from the bearer inasmuch as it aims to protect the bearer. However, PPE can also be interpreted as a distancing act by virtue of veiling the facial features and expressions of the bearer that plays a significant part in expressing emotion and forming of relationships and bonds between people. As described by Benner and Wrubel (1989) , in their seminal piece on caring, we need to understand the both the context and the involvement in the relationship to understand caring, as different actions may be interpreted as caring or noncaring based on both the context and the relationship. How then, may the wearing of face masks and other PPE influence the caring context and relationship, as they inevitably and purposefully provide a barrier to separate sub- How can such a risk for depersonalization be counteracted? As nurses, we may now need to increase our attention to how to convey caring actions as well as caring expressions of familiarity, compassion, welcoming, happiness and care more with our eyes, and in other embodied ways beyond the facial. Reflective and purposeful nursing presence and use of touch may be a strategy to counteract depersonalization, despite some of the intuitive and physical barriers to touch introduced by PPE. In a recent study by Kelly et al. (2020) , they described how physicians use touch to share emotions, demonstrate empathy and presence to patients. Touch was described as embodied empathic communication constituting a personal and fragile process in which non-verbal patient cues such as facial expressions and body language are carefully interpreted to determine whether or not touch is appropriate. As such, it may work to counter the risks of depersonalization with masks and PPE. In a much earlier study, Edvardsson et al. (2003) described the use of touch in nursing as a powerful tool in easing suffering and how touch was experienced by staff to bridge the roles of the nurse and patient by promoting increasingly seeing the patient as a person and facilitating a caring relationship, again providing support that touch could be a potent way to bridge barriers from PPE and veiling of expressions.There may be an increased place for verbal elaborations on the caring rationales behind PPE and other infection control measures to assist in understanding how they are put in place to keep patients safe as much as they are for keeping staff safe. Perhaps sometimes this mutuality can become lost when extreme demands are placed on individuals and systems in the midst of a pandemic. Creativity as well as compassionate reflection could be helpful in communicating caring in all contexts and due to COVID-19, relationships are for the benefit of others.In his philosophical work, the Danish ethicist Knud Løgstrup (Løgstrup et al., 2007) argues that the ethical demand impacts on all interactions with other persons and involve a basic trust that the other's intentions are good and something which emerges from being dependent upon others. Løgstrup's ethics is built upon the notion that by being interconnected, we are also dependent on others to a greater or lesser extent, and this interdependency implies an ethical demand to do good for the other, for the sake of the other, to take care of and help others to the best of 'my' ability.Think of a rural highway for example, where we expect to stay safe despite the fact that people drive their cars towards us at high speed, each separated only by a metre or so from the oncoming traffic. This is only possible because we enter into an implied, mutual obligation to do good to each other which relies on trust and the assumption that, myself as well as the other person, honours the ethical demand of doing good to others by not veering across the line into oncoming traffic.In the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic, doing what is best for the other involves wearing masks and observing other infection control measures, and in some countries, this renewed focus on adhering to the ethical demand is enforced by way of social stigma, fines and even imprisonment. As we navigate carefully between infection control measures, the ethical demand, metaphorical interpretations as well as facilitators and barriers to caring and person-centred care in pandemic times, nurses also need to remember that in addition to talking about 'R0 values', 'risk reduction strategies', 'odds ratios and treatment options', we are facing people who are living and experiencing the multidimensional and largely unknown impact, effects and stigma of this virus and the need to approach this with transformational care and person-centredness.In this commentary, we wanted to foreground the importance of the relationships between people and things (nurses and things), mutual obligation as an act of caring, depersonalization, embodied caring counter-practices and adherence to the ethical demand.We argued how, despite the paradoxes and constraints invoked by the current pandemic, this period in history should be seen instead by nurses as an opportunity for them to reflect and transform key aspects of their practice not only for themselves but also for the greater good and, for the sake of the other.https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0829-3544",Australia,first author,2020-12-18,12
5cc19188255015bcf58b1dccd40fb59908516c1d,Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T-cell immunity in recovered COVID-19 cases,"As of 20 October 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected more than 39 million individuals worldwide and caused more than 1.1 million deaths. 1 Despite optimism that an effective vaccine will be developed in the next 12 months and that the therapeutic administration of antiviral drugs or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies will reduce the severity of symptoms associated with COVID-19, it is likely that millions of more individuals will be infected over the coming years. [2] [3] [4] Therefore, the need to develop a thorough understanding of all aspects of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is critical. Antigen-specific T cells, capable of recognising nonstructural viral proteins and proteins involved in viral replication, are critical mediators in the early cellular immune response to all viral pathogens. [5] [6] [7] These antigen-experienced T cells serve a myriad of functions, from the direct targeting and cytolytic killing of virally infected cells to the augmentation of other immune responses, including the production of antibodies. [8] [9] [10] As a result of their significant role in immunological defence, virus-specific T-cell responses are typically established early after primary infection. 11 However, studies over the past two decades have shown that poor T-cell induction during initial infection can lead to significant T-cell dysfunction and chronic infection. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Observation of patients during early stage COVID-19 has highlighted that T-cell dysfunction is a driving cause of disease development. 20 Patients with severe symptoms show high expression of checkpoint markers, including PD-1, which suggests poor T-cell priming during the early stages of infection. 21, 22 Conversely, patients who resolve infection have recently been shown to generate antigen-specific Tcell responses against proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2. [23] [24] [25] [26] These observations support the contention that T cells play a role in the control of SARS-CoV-2, although it remains to be determined what impact T-cell immunity has upon the risk of reinfection and more importantly disease prevention. This in turn highlights the potential benefit of monitoring these antigen-specific T-cell responses during infection as a means of determining the risk of serious COVID-19 symptoms, and also suggests that immune interventions, such as vaccines, should also target T-cell immunity to reduce disease risk. 27 Here, we have assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity in whole blood collected from a cohort of 44 individuals convalescing from COVID-19. This whole-blood assay demonstrated consistent T-cell reactivity predominantly directed to viral structural proteins that could be detected by the induction of either interferon gamma (IFN-c) or interleukin (IL)-2. We further validated ex vivo T-cell reactivity by expanding the patients' SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells, which displayed broad antigen reactivity towards multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens.To determine whether antigen-specific T-cell immunity could be rapidly assessed in individuals who have recently recovered from COVID-19, we developed a whole-blood assay using overlapping peptide sets designed from SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Table 1) as stimuli ( Figure 1 ). Using this assay, we analysed whole blood from 44 COVID-19 convalescent patients together with 21 unexposed healthy individuals. Plasma harvested from the overnight stimulation was analysed by CBA, and to demonstrate antigen specificity, we subtracted background cytokine production generated from cultures with no antigen. This identified significantly elevated levels of the T-cell cytokines IFN-c and IL-2 (Figure 2a and b) in convalescent samples compared to unexposed samples. These responses indicate the successful generation of a T-cell-mediated immune response in convalescent individuals in response to SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation. In addition, convalescent patients displayed significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 ( Figure 2c ) compared to the unexposed cohort. Interestingly, we observed minimal differences in the remaining cytokines (TNF, IL-1b, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13 and IL-17a) between COVID-19-recovered and unexposed individuals (Supplementary figure 1). Principal component analysis (PCA) using the combined detection data from all analysed cytokines clearly stratified IL-2, IFN-c and, to a lesser extent, IL-8 as the top cytokine candidates for differentiating between the SARS-CoV-2specific responses of convalescent COVID-19 patients and unexposed individuals (Figure 2d , shown in green). This PCA further demonstrates that the remaining cytokines analysed in this assay do not discriminate between convalescent and unexposed groups.To illustrate the differential levels of cytokine detected from all blood samples (both convalescent and unexposed) in response to SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation, we generated individual heat maps ( Figure 3 ). Here, the total range of detection for each individual cytokine was normalised across all samples and displayed on a colour (viridis) scale ranging from 0.0 (purple) to 1.0 (yellow). This analysis distinguished elevated IFN-c and IL-2 cytokine responses in convalescent patients compared to healthy donors when their blood was stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools CoV-3, 4 and 5. Here, statistical analysis confirmed a significant correlation between the production of IL-2 and IFN-c in convalescent patient responses ( Figure 4 ). In comparison, the heat map illustrates that the remaining cytokines failed to differentiate between convalescent and unexposed individuals ( Given that a clear association between sex, age and COVID-19 disease severity has been reported 21,28 , we next investigated the impact of these parameters on the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses in recovered individuals. We observed no significant differences in IFN-c or IL-2 responses to CoV stimulation between the sexes, suggesting that after the resolution of infection, both women and men generate a similar memory response (Figure 5a and b). However, we did identify a difference in the magnitude of IFN-c and IL-2 responses based on age. Participants who were >50 years of age at Spike glycoprotein N terminus region 158 Figure 1 . Schematic of the whole-blood assay for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2-responsive T-cell cytokine production. Whole blood (200 µL) was added into seven separate wells of a 96-well plate and stimulated under different conditions. Five wells were stimulated with CoVpeptide pools (CoV-1 to 5), the sixth condition was a positive control (mitogen), and the final well received no stimulation. The assay was incubated overnight for an average of 20 h in a CO 2 controlled incubator. Following this, the plate was spun and plasma harvested for cytometric bead array analysis to detect production levels of 12 different cytokines.the time of recruitment generated a significantly higher IFN-c response to the CoV-3 and 5 pools ( Figure 5c ) and a significantly higher IL-2 response to the CoV-1, 2, 3 and 5 pools (Figure 5d ) compared to participants below 50 years of age.To determine whether there were differences in the global immune composition of recovered and unexposed individuals, we first performed phenotypic analysis on total PBMC and observed no significant differences in lymphocyte populations between these cohorts (Supplementary figure 3) . Next, to validate the Tcell reactivity detected in whole blood and to map the antigen specificity of memory T cells, we expanded antigen-specific T cells from PBMC following stimulation with the CoV-peptide pools ( Table 1) . After 14 days in culture, cytokine production (IFN-c, TNF, IL-2 and CD107a degranulation) was assessed following recall stimulation with each of the overlapping CoVpeptide pools. Strikingly, while we saw a diverse IFN-c response from CD4 + T cells, which included recognition of the proteins spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) together with ORFs 3a, 7a, 8 and 9b (Figure 6a ), the predominant memory CD8 + T-cell response was directed against the N protein ( Figure 6b ). Of the 18 recovered individuals assessed, a majority showed expansion of N protein-specific T cells, with a median frequency of 9.36%, whereas the median response to ORF3a was 1.36%. We also observed consistent low-level recognition of the two spike pools. Polyfunctional analysis on expanded T cells revealed a similar response profile to each dominant antigen, with CD4 + T cells recognising N, S or M characterised by the single production of TNF or co-expression of TNF and IFN-c (Figure 6c ). CD8 + T cells predominantly produced TNF and IFN-c, with a high proportion also demonstrating degranulation (CD107a). In contrast to our ex vivo whole-blood analysis, we saw little IL-2 production, suggesting these memory T cells undergo functional changes following in vitro proliferation and differentiation.T cells play an essential role in the control of human viral infections. In the absence of T-cell immunity, chronic infection occurs which typically requires ongoing antiviral treatment. Similarly, . Association of IFN-c and IL-2 in response to SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools. Data represent a correlation between IFN-c and IL-2 production in response to (a) CoV-3 (r 2 = 0.4162, P < 0.001), (b) CoV-4 (r 2 = 0.3078, P = 0.002) and (c) CoV-5 (r 2 = 0.6678, P < 0.0001) peptide pools. Statistical analysis was performed to calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r 2 ) and statistical significance using a two-tailed t-test (P). early observations suggest that the induction of a SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response is likely important in the control of COVID-19, whereby severe disease is associated with lymphopenia and checkpoint marker expression on T cells. 20, 21, 27 The capacity to rapidly detect the induction of antigen-specific immunity following diagnosis could provide a means of stratifying patient risk, particularly with regard to the onset of severe disease, and potentially assist in identifying individuals who require earlier intervention with antiviral therapy and other treatment. In this study, we demonstrate a simple whole-blood assay that can rapidly detect cytokine production in response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. In recovered people, our assay confirmed a predominantly T helper 1 (Th1) cytokine response driven by antigen-specific T cells and identified by detection of IFN-c and IL-2 in response to both structural and nonstructural SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These cytokines are also known to be important in the effector function of CD8 + T cells.The results from this study confirm recent observations demonstrating a bias towards T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 structural antigens in recently recovered patients. 23, 29 While further work is required to delineate and define the key T-cell antigenic determinants in SARS-CoV-2, it is clearly evident in this cohort that most people who successfully resolve infection generate readily detectable T-cell immunity, a majority of which is raised against the N protein. This finding is supported by other recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 T-cell immunity. 23, 24, [29] [30] [31] Based on observations in other coronavirus infections, particularly in animal models, it is also likely that this T-cell response plays a critical role in disease prevention. 32 Ongoing studies in patients with acute infection and symptomatic disease should help to further define the role of T cells in the prevention of COVID-19. Importantly, longitudinal analysis is necessary to provide further insight into the stability of these T-cell responses over time, and their association with COVID-19 disease severity. It also remains to be determined what role measurement of IL-2 has in the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell memory and whether the quantities detected during this early memory phase are maintained long term. While most current immune-monitoring approaches for viral infections in humans focus upon IFN-c, IL-2 production by both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells has been associated with enhanced viral control in other settings and could be a critical mediator of immune defence against SARS-CoV-2. [32] [33] [34] Despite the known importance of T cells in the control of most human viruses, very few clinically approved diagnostic tests are available to study Tcell immunity, with the exception of the QuantiFERON-CMV whole-blood assay, currently employed to assess cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in solid organ transplant patients. In this context, the QuantiFERON-CMV assay is clinically approved to assess CMV-specific T-cell immunity and is used successfully to stratify patient risk with regard to onset of viral reactivation and disease. 35 This knowledge has allowed for improved implementation of antiviral therapies. The results of our current study demonstrate that a similar rapid whole-blood test can effectively assess SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity. We anticipate that the ease of application of our SARS-CoV-2 wholeblood assay will provide an effective means to study SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity in a large number of patients, particularly during the acute stages of infection. We anticipate that this approach will also provide a rapid and early clinical risk assessment for patients that have failed to generate effective immunity, and therefore require additional therapeutic intervention, such as antiviral or immunotherapeutic treatment. This type of approach may also be applicable for monitoring of vaccine-induced T-cell responses.This study was performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethics approval to undertake the research was obtained from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute Human Research Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The inclusion criteria for the study were that participants were over the age of 18, had been clinically diagnosed by PCR with SARS-CoV-2 infection and had subsequently been released from isolation following resolution of symptomatic infection. A total of 44 participants were recruited in May and June 2020 from the south-east region of Queensland, Australia. Participants ranged in age from 20 to 75, 17 were male and 27 were female, and were a median of 58 (46-102) days postinitial diagnosis. The majority of participants were returned overseas travellers. Blood samples were collected from all participants to assess whole-blood SARS-CoV-2 T-cell immunity, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated to assess cellular phenotype. A cohort of 21 healthy (i.e. non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed) adults was also recruited from south-east Queensland prior to any widespread transmission, to serve as a comparison group.A small-scale whole-blood assay was used to recall memory T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2. Heparinised whole blood (200 µL) was aliquoted into seven wells of a 96-well Vbottom plate. SARS-CoV-2 overlapping peptide pools, measuring a final concentration of 1 µg mL -1 per peptide, were added to five wells as outlined in Table 1 . These peptide pools were supplied by JPT Technologies (Berlin, Germany). Wells containing no peptide (NP), or 20 µg mL -1 of the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), were used as negative and positive controls. The plate was incubated for an average of 20 h at 37°C in a CO 2 -controlled incubator, spun by centrifugation, and then, plasma supernatant was collected and stored at -80°C before use.A cytometric bead array (CBA) was used to quantify the production of T-cell cytokines: IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IFN-c. The CBA was performed using the BD Biosciences Flex-sets (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Samples were acquired using a BD LSRFortessa with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). Postacquisition cytokine analysis was performed using FCAP array (BD Biosciences) software. To generate heat maps of each cytokine, the total range of detection for each individual cytokine was normalised across all samples with the maximum value (in pg mL -1 ) detected for each cytokine scaled as 1.0. The data are displayed on a colour (viridis) scale ranging from 0.0 (purple) to 1.0 (yellow).Immune cell phenotyping to assess the frequency and absolute number of T-cell subsets, B-cell subsets, NK cell subsets and monocytes was performed on PBMC isolated from all participants. In a BD TruCount tube (BD Biosciences), 50 µL of PBMC was incubated with the following antibodies: anti-CD3 BV711, anti-CD4 AF700, anti-CD8 SB780, anti-CD16 PE, anti-CD19 PE-Cy5 and live/dead fixable near-IR dead cell stain (Life Technologies). Following incubation, cells were fixed with BD Cytofix (BD Biosciences) and acquired using a BD LSRFortessa with FACSDiva software. TruCount bead counts were used to provide cell counts prior to cryopreservation. Postacquisition analysis was performed using FlowJo version 10 software (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, Oregon).Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were harvested from peripheral blood within 24 h of collection. PBMCs were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 overlapping peptide pools (Table 1 ) and were grown in RPMI-1640 culture medium containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) and 10% foetal bovine serum, and supplemented with recombinant IL-2 every 2-3 days thereafter. On day 14, T cells were harvested and assessed for antigen specificity using an intracellular cytokine assay.Cultured T cells were stimulated with individual SARS-CoV-2 antigen overlapping peptide pools and incubated for 4 h in the presence of GolgiPlug, GolgiStop and anti-CD107a-FITC (BD Biosciences). Following stimulation, cells were washed and stained with anti-CD8-PerCP-Cy5.5 (eBioscience) and anti-CD4-PE-Cy7 or anti-CD4-Pacific Blue (BD Biosciences) for 30 min before being fixed and permeabilised with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences). After 20 min of fixation, cells were washed in BD Perm/Wash buffer (BD Biosciences) and stained with anti-IFN-c-Alexa Fluor700, anti-IL-2-PE and anti-TNF-APC (all from BD Biosciences) for a further 30 min. Finally, cells were washed again and acquired using a BD LSRFortessa with FACSDiva software. Postacquisition analysis was performed using FlowJo software (TreeStar). Cytokine detection levels identified in the no-peptide control condition were subtracted from the corresponding test conditions to account for nonspecific, spontaneous cytokine production.GraphPad Prism 8.2.1 (San Diego, CA) was used to perform statistical analysis. Statistical comparisons between participant groups (unexposed and recovered) were made using unpaired Mann-Whitney U Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Correlative analysis was performed using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Box plots were used to represent median (horizontal line), 25th and 75th percentiles (boxes) and minimum and maximum values (whiskers). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.We thank all of the participants who generously donated their blood for this study.

2fee2ddb1935c7cb2d2d6ef808631f163a7526c6,Comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibody dynamics in New Zealand,"It is now well established that antibody responses against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are activated promptly after infection. 1 The virus, and causative agent of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, contains four structural proteins, the most immunodominant being the Nucleocapsid (N) protein, Spike (S) protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. Measuring antibody responses to these antigens using serological assays has been critical for determining previous viral exposure in individuals, studying community transmission, and conducting population sero-surveys. 1 However, much is still to be learnt about the long-term duration and protective capacity of these responses.Antibody responses comprise different isotypes and subclasses, each associated with unique immune functions and dynamics over time. 2 Following SARS-CoV-2 infection there is an almost concurrent rise in Immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA and IgG, with IgM then beginning to decline approximately three weeks after symptom onset. [3] [4] [5] [6] There have been conflicting reports with respect to IgG duration, ranging from a relatively short three months 7 , to six months or longer 8-10 , in part due to SARS-CoV-2 antibody dynamics being highly antigen-dependant.A triplex bead-based immunoassay was developed, with N protein, trimeric S protein and RBD coupled to spectrally unique beads. Compatibilty of the beads in a multiplex format was confirmed, as was comparability with previously described ELISA for S protein and RBD 22 , and N protein titres determined using the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay 23 , with highly significant correlations for all three antigens (Supplementary Figure 1) . The level of SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific isotypes (IgG, IgM, IgA) and subclasses (IgG1, 2, 3 and 4) were determined in a cohort of 112 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 participants, 50 of whom had multiple time points (n=189 samples), and the majority of whom had mild disease ( Table 1) .The days post-infection ranged up to 246 days, enabling the kinetics of 21 different antibody features (3 SARS-CoV-2 antigens and 7 secondary detectors) to be temporally investigated.To explore the contribution of IgG subclasses to total IgG (IgGtot), the proportion of samples with antibody subclass levels above baseline in the three time groups were compared ( Figure   2 , Supplementary Table 1 ). The four IgG subclasses were elevated against each antigen in the majority of samples collected 7-63 days post-symptom onset. IgG3 responses were particularly strong in this earliest time group, with at least 96% of patients having a response above baseline against both RBD and S protein (Supplementary Table 1 ). In samples collected 63-124 days post symptom onset, IgG1 and IgG3 responses dominated for all three antigens, with IgG2 uncommonly, and IgG4 rarely, above baseline. In the 125-250 day group IgG1 antibodies against RBD and S protein persisted, with 64% (51/80) and 59% (47/80) of participants having antibodies above baseline, respectively, as did IgG3 against S protein with 60% (48/80) above baseline. As with IgGtot, the anti-N subclass responses waned faster than RBD and S protein with <30% participants having detectable levels above baseline of any subclass in the 125-250 day group.NAbs were measured using a surrogate assay that quantifies inhibition of the RBD/ACE-2 interaction 12 and found to be relatively stable over the eight month study period ( Figure 3 ).While there was a modest downward trend, 89% (70/79) in the 63-124 day group and 90%Lastly, since IgGtot persist, and the bead-based assay format is compatible with small quantities of sera (2µL), the feasibility of using dried blood samples to measure IgGtot was explored.The duration of antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection is, in essence, being studied in real-time globally. Initial studies that purported early antibody waning were based on the N protein, now known to induce antibodies with a relatively short half-life 8 , or linear extrapolations of S protein data collected 2-3 months post-infection. 7 More recent analyses (5-8 months post-infection) show that S protein, RBD and NAbs are likely more stable than originally predicted. 6, 8, 10, 15, 18, 26 Here, further evidence is provided of the durability of the SARS-CoV-2 humoral immune response over an eight month period. Importantly, this study was performed in a setting where there is next to no likelihood of immune boosting by reexposure, given the successful public health response to COVID-19 in New Zealand. 20,21 That 99% of sera had anti-RBD IgG and 96% had anti-S protein IgG above baseline levels 4-8 months after infection in a setting with no circulating SARS-CoV-2 is notable, particularly given the majority of participants had non-severe infections.Plasma and serum samples were collected from multiple sources with appropriate ethical board approval. Samples collected before the pandemic were used as negative controls (""prepandemic,"" n=113), details of which have been described previously. 22 Samples from PCRconfirmed COVID-19 individuals were obtained from hospital in-patients in Auckland (n=18) (ethics HDEC 20NTB76) and convalescent participants in the Southern Region of New Zealand (ethics HDEC 20NTB101) as previously described. 22, 23 Samples were also obtained from donors with a prior COVID-19 diagnosis, collected at the New Zealand Blood service as part of a Medsafe approved process for convalescent plasma preparation. The final PCRconfirmed cohort in this study comprised 189 samples from 112 participants, 50 of whom had samples collected at multiple time points (Table 1) . Participant samples were grouped by days/months post symptom onset (infection) based on timeframes in which the samplers were obtained (acute and early convalescence, 7--62 days (0-2 months, n=27); mid-convalescence, 63-124 days (2-4 months, n=79); late convalescence, 125-250 days (4-8 months, n=80)).Surrogate neutralisation assays were performed using the SARS-CoV-2 sVNT (GenScript) according to the manufacturers' instructions as previously described. 12, 22 Briefly, samples were diluted 1:20 and incubated with an equal volume of peroxidase-conjugated RBD for 30 min at 37°C, then added to wells pre-coated with human ACE-2 receptor protein and incubated for 15 min at 37°C prior to washing and development. Inhibition was calculated as (1-OD sample/OD of negative control) × 100. Any sample with a percentage inhibition ≥20% was deemed positive for NAbs, with this manufacturers cut-off previously shown to result in 100% specificity in our laboratory. 22Data were analysed using Prism 8 (GraphPad) or R (version 4.0.2) within R Studio (version 1.2.5042) using packages rstatix (v 0.6.0; Kassambara, 2020) and the tidyverse (v1.3.0;Wickham, 2019). Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) with a span of 0.95 were used to visualise trends in antibody levels over time. Kruskal-Wallis followed by pairwise Dunn tests were performed to calculate statistical significance. Bonferroni method was used to correct for multiple comparisons. A P-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.The following models were applied to NAb data.Exponential decay in which an exponential decay curve was fitted to the full datasetwhere is measured in days. This method will likely underestimate the decay rate if the period in which antibodies increase after infection (growth period) for some individuals is long. It is also strongly affected by potential differences in both the size and timing of the peak level of NAbs between individuals. The best fit coefficients with 95% confidence interval are = 66 (56.7, 75.3) and = 0.0011 (0.00005, 0.00217).Growth and decay, which uses a two-part model fitted to the full datasetThis allows an initial growth period to account for the underestimate that results from fitting a decay curve to measurements still in the growth phase. However, strong differences between individuals, particular in the timing of the peak level of NAbs will still affect estimations. This model predicts a slightly faster decay speed than the exponential decay model = 0.0016 (0.00053, 0.00274) that starts after 11 days ( = 11 (5.65, 16.35)).Of the 189 data points for NAbs, 127 are multiple measurements from 50 individuals, of which 33 (88 measurements) are in the exponential decay stage, i.e. inhibition is decreasing with time. The individual decay model incorporates data from these 33 individuals only. An exponential decay curve is fitted to each individual separately. An exponential distribution is fitted to the individual decay rates and the best fit parameter and 95% confidence interval reported. The mean decay rate much is faster than predicted by the other models with =0.00476 (95% confidence interval 0.00348, 0.00691).This work was funded by the School of Medicine Foundation (University of Auckland) and the",New Zealand,abstract,2020-12-11,12
24a64fbfe033576720049286e60f59214829ebe5,A Potential Role for Photobiomodulation Therapy in Disease Treatment and Prevention in the Era of COVID-19,"pandemic, raging since late 2019 is caused by yet another strain. The virus particle is around 100 nanometres in diameter and can be seen only through an electron microscope. The aerosol or droplet transmission of the virus to humans gains entry through mucosal surfaces of the mouth, nose and eyes [1] . Viral entry is mediated through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a membrane-associated enzyme expressed in vascular endothelia, renal and cardiovascular tissue as well as epithelia of the small intestine. The relationship between ACE2 expression and infection has not been determined [2] . The treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have the additional effect to upregulate ACE2 expression, which may play a significant role in individual viral responses.The median incubation period before symptoms might become evident is 4.9 -5.8 days, with a range of 1 -14 days [3] . Once infected and thus contagious, the relatively long incubation period in humans facilitates the spread of the infection [3] . Beyond the incubation period, symptoms of the infected vary widely, from none or minimal symptoms, to florid and rapidly progressive respiratory distress. The elderly are the most predisposed to the deleterious sequalae of COVID-19 [4] [5] [6] , most probably due to an aging immune system, increased manifestations of inflammatory conditions and accumulated mitochondrial dysfunction [7] . In the USA, 77% of all deaths are in the over 65 years age group [5] . Those with chronic comorbidities that impact their immune system are the second group at risk, including CVD [8] , type II diabetes (T2D) [9, 10] , chronic respiratory disease [10] , hypertension [10] , cancer [11] , metabolic syndrome [12] and obesity [13, 14] . It has been reported that less than 1% of all deaths from COVID-19 do not have a comorbidity [15] . A third susceptible group are those with a hyper-excitable neuro-immune axis, which affects the nervous system as well as endothelial and vascular responses leading to an over-intense immune response. These people are often younger and can have hyper-excitable physiological responses to environmental stressors. Risk factors for this response include genotypes for ion channelopathies such as migraine, erythromyalgia and epilepsy, resulting in these endothelial susceptibilities [16] . This group can be of higher intelligence [17] and are possibly over-represented in health care workers. Health care workers possibly have a higher morbidity and mortality compared to the general population [18] , which may be influenced in some way by this immune hyperexcitability.Those susceptible to the virus may succumb to dysregulated immunity, recalcitrant deoxygenation and respiratory distress, multi-organ failures and debility resulting from prolonged a catabolic state. Importantly, they also often suffer adverse reactions (ADRs) to therapeutic interventions including the established and potential cardiovascular ADRs related to the antibiotics and high dose corticosteroids, anti-viral and immune modulating drugs currently used in the management of COVID-19 infections [19, 20] . Other features of infection include cardiovascular injury [2] , atrial fibrillation [21] , central and peripheral nervous system symptoms [22] , which affect over a third of the infected patients [23] , mouth ulcers and hyposmia/anosmia (loss of smell). Rapid and fulminant progression to pneumonia can occur in the elderly and people with comorbidities. This is thought to occur as a result of an initial poor immune response followed by an inappropriate hyper-immune reaction or ""cytokine storm"". The resulting unrelenting inflammation affects vital organs including pulmonary tissue and vascular structures [6] . This over-responsive immune response may be associated with neutrophil recruitment and activity [24] . The subsequent cellular damage and multi-organ failures heighten mortality risk more so than the infection itself and is particularly prevalent among the aged and those with comorbidities. Immunosuppressive therapies including corticosteroids https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04355247 to prevent or placate the cytokine storm [25, 26] in COVID-19 have so far only met with modest success. More targeted therapies are urgently needed.Recovery from COVID-19 is frequently protracted and the long-term prognosis remains to be fully realized. An unknown percentage will have ongoing symptoms after discharge from hospital and/or recovery from overt respiratory and other life-threatening symptoms. It has been reported www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ 2020/jul/17/most-covid-19-patients-admitted-to-asydney-hospital-in-march-still-have-symptoms that at 3or 4-months post hospital discharge, up to 80% of recovered COVID-19 patients continued to be symptomatic. Nonspecific aches and pain, dyspnoea, palpitations, joint and chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness, headaches, fatigability, hyposmia and anosmia are not infrequent [27] . More serious ongoing symptoms can include pulmonary hypertension and interstitial fibrosis, pericardial effusion and myocarditis, neurologic and neuropsychiatric sequalae including dysautonomia [28] , myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) [29] , depression [30] and autoimmune disease [31] .A less recognised consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic is the unintended effect that the measures taken to contain the pandemic have had on vulnerable individuals. Many of these individuals have been unable to socialise or to attend exercise and rehabilitation classes due to the lockdown period and the social isolation necessary to combat spread of the virus. The stress of this can have the effect of reducing the resilience and immunity of the very individuals (the elderly and those with comorbidities) that the measures are designed to protect [32] , thus increasing the chances of an unfavourable outcome if infected.A magic bullet solution for the current COVID-19 pandemic is unlikely in the near future, although much research is directed towards an effective vaccine. A wide range of social and lifestyle measures to reduce cross infection have been met with success in some but not other regions or countries [33] . Development and discovery of novel and effective pharmacotherapy, vaccines for disease prevention and repurposing existing drugs to fight the COVID-19 are being robustly pursued [34] but there is also a need for broad scale clinical trials of potential strategies, including interdisciplinary collaborations, aimed at mitigating the severe effects and side-effects of the COVID-19 pandemic [5] .There is a strong link between the gut microbiome and susceptibility to disease and most likely to COVID-19 [35] . The gut microbiota is well known to affect immunity [36, 37] , interacting with the gut mucosa and stimulating the production of both pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Low inflammatory conditions support a healthy gut microbiota, which in turn contributes to maintaining non-inflammatory conditions. A cascade into dysbiosis leads to a disruption of the mucosal barrier, allowing microbial products of the dysregulated microbial population to leak into surrounding tissues and increase the inflammatory response, which further increases dysbiosis. This contributes to generally reduced immunity and to the comorbidities known to contribute to COVID-19 susceptibility (such as obesity, T2D, heart disease). Elderly individuals frequently suffer a decrease in microbial diversity in the gut, contributing to dysbiosis. In addition, there is a gut/lung axis that links the microbiome of the gut with lung health [38] , with gut metabolites transferred to the lung [37] and the gut bacteria playing an important role in the response to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [35] . Early results of the microbiome analysis of a small number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients indicated that the microbiome was adversely impacted, with depletion of bacteria representative of a healthy microbiome and enrichment of opportunistic pathogens [39] . These changes were correlated with disease severity and persisted throughout the hospitalization period.Changing the composition of the gut microbiota with diet and supplements can improve immunity generally [40] , while altering the microbiome (with soluble fibre) has been shown to reduce the severity of allergic lung inflammation [41] . Modulation of the gut microbiome (with diet, soluble fibre, probiotics) has been suggested as a potential way to assist viral respiratory infections generally [42] and SARS-Cov-2 in particular [35] . There has been speculation that the gut microbiota can have an influence on ACE2 receptors and cardiovascular health and are therefore a potential target for cardiopulmonary therapy [43] . Additionally, the ACE2 receptors are also expressed in the gut enterocytes [35] . The expression of ACE2 (in a mouse model) can be regulated by certain species of the gut microbiome (Bacteroides species), part of the population depleted during COVID-19 hospitalization [39] . The implications of this has yet to be investigated.The oral microbiome is also an important component of immunity. A healthy microbial population can be disturbed by a dysregulated immune system, an inflammatory response or poor oral hygiene [44] . A disturbed microbiota is implicated in a number of diseases, such as periodontitis, CVD and Alzheimer's disease [45] as well as being less able to prevent viral infection [46] . Interestingly, periodontal disease has a strong association with obesity, CVD, T2D as well as aging, the same comorbidities associated with a poor prognosis with COVID-19 and the potential of oral microbiome dysbiosis and susceptibility to COVID-19 has been raised [47, 48] . Improvement in oral hygiene is suggested as a way to maintain a healthy oral microbiome, which may be somewhat protective against viral infection [49] .Throughout the ages, light, including sunlight has been known for its wide-ranging health effects for myriad maladies. In 1903 Dr. Niels Ryberg Finsen, a Danish physician was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work in treating tuberculosis with ultraviolet or blue light and smallpox with red light [50] . The contemporary clinical practice of PBM therapy, often also referred to as low-level laser therapy, is the result of on-going evolution since its first application over half-a century ago, when the work of Dr. Endre Mester and colleagues at the Semmelweis Medical University in Hungary demonstrated its therapeutic benefits for wound healing [51] .PBM is the use of narrow wavelength bands of light (either LED or laser) to modulate cellular responses with no thermal effect. Putatively, PBM carries no risk to health [52] [53] [54] , its safety profile equating that of ultrasound tests. Unlike much pharmaceutical therapy, PBM is free of serious deleterious side-effects and is, by its nature, non-invasive. PBM therapy is mostly delivered for no more than 10-20 minutes through portable, handheld or wearable devices and is safely repeatable. Measurable symptomatic and clinical benefits can result from a single treatment but PBM therapy is usually provided as a course of several treatment sessions.The main target of PBM is considered to be the electron transport chain of the mitochondria, in particular complex IV, cytochrome-C-oxidase, which acts as a chromophore, absorbing red and near infrared light [55] . The effect of this absorption is thought to be the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the complex, allowing increased membrane potential, increased ATP production and downstream cellular signalling via ATP, cAMP, ROS, Ca 2+ and nitric oxide (NO) to influence gene transcription [55] .There are also many other chromophores capable of absorbing light with resulting physiological effects, such as opsins and light-activated ion channels. The most effective wavelength for delivery of PBM in immune modulation is likely to be in the red and near-infrared range, based on the cytochrome-Coxidase and porphyrin absorption peaks being centred at 640 nm and HbO 2 at 900nm [55] . The energy required for effective PBM is low, in the range of 1 to 16 joules/cm 2 . The PBM dose is biphasic, meaning that above a certain threshold (outside of the dose window) increasing the energy will not increase the therapeutic effect [56] . PBM has a multitude of effects on the body, in many organ systems and is able to treat various disorders (Figure 1 ), through its action at the cellular and mitochondrial level [55] . In experimental models, the degree and type of immune responses to PBM are influenced by the anatomic surface where treatment is applied. For example, immunomodulatory effects appeared to be more effective when applied on the thymus area compared to limbs, with a favourable rise in interleukin (IL)-2, NO and heat shock protein 70 production. Treatment dose, cumulative dose and duration of exposure also appear to pay a role where unduly prolonged treatment duration may even cause attenuation and reversal of treatment efficacy toward immunosuppression [57] .The literature is replete with experimental and clinical trials demonstrating therapeutic efficacy of PBM in a multitude of disease process, including inflammation. PBM therapy has recently been recommended as standard care for the treatment of oral mucositis following chemo or radiation therapy in the MSCC/ISOO guidelines www.mascc.org/mucositis-guidelines.PBM has been shown to improve the general health and resilience of cells and tissues. The effect of PBM to improve mitochondrial metabolism and ATP generation leads to increased muscle strength and performance in sports and athletics [58, 59] and to reduced muscle wasting and degeneration in animal and cell culture models [60] [61] [62] . This makes it a candidate for treatment of COVID-19 cases under respiratory distress. PBM has been demonstrated to be more effective in damaged or diseased cells, tissues and individuals [55] . PBM has also been shown to have an effect in chronic obstructive airway disease when the muscles of the chest wall are treated [63] . Efficient mitochondria are also important in overcoming disease and in the recovery process. Often, mitochondrial dysfunction increases with age and may not be sufficient to enable recovery after infective disease and other immune insults [64] . PBM is known to enhance mitochondrial function, but the positive effect of PBM on the aging process in animal models has yet to be demonstrated in humans [65] . The action of PBM on the mitochondria also has the effect of activating transcription factors, which can lead to increased expression of genes involved in inflammatory signalling [66] .PBM is effective at reducing myocardial infarct size and reducing inflammation in animal models [67] , has been suggested as therapy in human CVD [68] and has been shown to modulate the expression of ACE2 [67] . PBM has also been shown to improve blood flow and oxygenation [69, 70] , both peripherally and in the CNS most probably due to the release of NO, an important vasodilator. PBM therapy has been used to treat post-viral and chronic fatigue, as well as fibromyalgia and other instances of centrally mediated pain [71] .PBM appears to exert pluripotent effects in the modulation of inflammation and immunity [72] . Many studies have demonstrated that PBM modulates inflammation by reducing the pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α) and other inflammatory markers released from activated inflammatory cells, while increasing the antiinflammatory cytokines (IL-10) [72] . The immunomodulatory effect of PBM on cytokines regulation and the complement cascade occurs via the POMC pathway, involving regulation of the hypothalamic pituitary axis through the direct modulation of the POMC/melanocortin signalling pathway including a-MSH, a potent antiinflammatory molecule. The POMC pathway is regulated by PBM [73] , which in turn modulates both ACTH and βopioid, as well as, interestingly, ACE activity [74] .One of the central effects of PBM on the immune response is via the modulation of neutrophil function [75] by balancing neutrophil numbers, improving neutrophil efficiency and modulating the neutrophil extracellular trap formation [76] . Reducing over-accumulation of neutrophils is a major mechanism for the effect of PBM in reducing acute lung inflammation [77] . This is crucial in preventing the cytokine storm cascade in autoimmune diseases. PBM also modulates the ratio of M1 and M2 macrophage phenotypes, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increasing antiinflammatory cytokines and thus balance the inflammatory process [78] .These inflammatory changes facilitated by PBM have profound effects on many body processes. For example, PBM therapy has been shown to modulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD4+ cells to reduce inflammatory effects in multiple sclerosis patients and healthy adults by increasing IL-10 and reducing IFNγ [79, 80] . PBM reduces the number of inflammatory cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as fibrotic tissue in a mouse model of lung fibrosis [81] . Acute lung inflammation in rats is reduced with PBM to reduce oedema, neutrophil influx and TNF-α, while reducing IL-10 in rats [82] .In an experimental model of induced acute peritonitis in rats, Yu and co-workers [83] showed PBM resulted in lymphocyte proliferation and enhanced lymphocyte ATP synthesis compared to controls, and the 60-day survival rate of the PBM group was double that of the control group (p<0.001). Assis et al [84] further demonstrated the immune modulation capability of PBM, with septic rats treated with PBM exhibiting lower IL-6 activity and decreased atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 immunoexpression (markers of sepsis related muscle catabolic states).PBM causes mitogenic stimulation responsive lymphocyte proliferation and enhanced lymphocyte ATP synthesis [83] . A plausible mechanism for PBM induced lymphocytic proliferation is through the reaction of light with haemoglobin, resulting in oxygen radical production [85] . Indeed, in immunological cells, PBM induces production of reactive oxygen species, NO or interleukins most often, leading to an anti-inflammatory effect [85] . It is well documented that various immune response processes are highly dependent on cellular energy, the latter being depressed in sepsis and septic shock cases [86, 87] . The mitochondria probably act as photo-acceptors for PBM and robustly reactivate cellular energy synthesis to re-establish ATP levels in a variety of cells including lymphocytes and macrophages, and through several pathways that trigger activation of nucleic acid synthesis and cellular proliferation [88, 89] .PBM has been shown to be effective in controlling neutrophil activation, thus restoring the balance between pro and antioxidant mediators by reducing proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) in a mouse model of acute lung injury induced by gut ischemia and reperfusion [82, 90] . This has also been shown in mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis [91] and chronic obstructive airway disease induced by tobacco smoke [92] . The infiltration of neutrophils into the lungs, which contributes to inflammation, is also reduced by PBM [78] .The efficacy of PBM therapy to treat pneumonia has been reported in 48 infants treated with conventional therapy who also received laser therapy with ""Vostok"" laser therapeutic devices for 2-3 days, compared to 45 infants receiving conventional therapy alone and another 18 healthy newborns as controls. In a trial of using red light therapy to treat retinopathy of prematurity [93] , one notable side-effect was the survival of all 21 premature infants in the treatment group, while 4 infants in the nontreatment group died from lung complications (pers. com. Prof Krisztina Valter). It has also been reported that ARDS can be successfully treated with PBM therapy [94] .We have previously shown [95] that PBM can alter the gut microbiome in a favourable way in a mouse model. We have also demonstrated favourable changes in the gut microbiome in a number of human trials (manuscript in preparation) and are currently investigating the potential of PBM to alter the oral microbiome. One potential mechanism for the effect on gut microbiota is the reduction of inflammation in the adipose tissue of the abdomen afforded by PBM. Improving the gut microbiome from a dysbiotic state, whether by diet, prebiotics, exercise or PBM, will reduce inflammatory processes, improve general health and protect against future immunological insults [96] , including, perhaps, a future cytokine storm.Recently there has been much interest in the use of transcranial PBM to address many symptoms of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders [97] . Transcranial devices have been shown to modulate neural oscillations [70, 98] , improve cognition in healthy adults, improve cognitive performance of people with TBIs [99] and improve symptoms of depression [100] . We have demonstrated a positive effect of PBM therapy in improvement of cognition scores in individuals with Parkinson's disease (manuscript in preparation).A number of recent publications have suggested that PBM therapy may be of benefit in the treatment and/or recovery of COVID-19 [101, 102] by targeting the blood, either directly or trans-dermally [102, 103] and/or targeting the lungs [104] . At least one trial of PBM therapy to the respiratory muscles is underway https://clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/NCT04386694 and PBM therapy is being trialled as a therapy for COVID-19 in Russia www.lazmik.ru/assets/templates/docs/Coronaviridae_ SARS_COVID-19_LLLT_protocol_eng1 .pdf. There has been one recent case report of the effectiveness of PBM therapy to treat a patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia [105] .There are a number of areas in the COVID-19 crisis that may benefit from PBM therapy, especially among the elderly and other individuals with comorbidities or conditions that make them especially vulnerable to the virus:1. Individuals infected with the virus and who are admitted to intensive care units may benefit from PBM therapy to the chest to help improve airways, improve blood oxygenation and increase muscle performance to assist with breathing. PBM may also help to balance the immune system and reduce immune hyperactivity to resist progression to a cytokine storm. The same mechanisms may help vulnerable individuals infected with the virus to avoid the worsening of symptoms that would otherwise lead to admission to hospital. 2. The main clinical benefit of PBM therapy in COVID-19, however, appears to be for patients who continue to be chronically symptomatic in convalescence, including the elderly, those with multiple comorbidities and the hyper immuneexcitable. These groups are particularly susceptible to serious infection with protracted recovery. PBM therapy is likely to improve cellular energy and general health status, lung immune function, gut microbiome/immune status, brain function and reduce muscle fatigue. We have also shown that PBM readily reverses anosmia in participants with Parkinson's disease (manuscript in preparation). In the short term PBM therapy could improve recovery from COVID-19 and reduce the risk of post-infection sequalae. In the longer term PBM therapy could improve the comorbidities that increase vulnerability to viral infection in these populations. It would also be important to identify those younger hyper-excitable individuals who are at greater risk of an over-reaction to the viral infection.3. Individuals who have been adversely affected by the lockdown and social isolation strategies in that they have been unable to regularly exercise and/or attend their normal rehabilitation session are likely to also benefit greatly from PBM therapy in the same ways as detailed above. 4. An additional benefit of PBM is as an adjuvant to vaccination. The elderly and those with comorbidity are most prone to be non-or underresponders to vaccines [106] . Kashiwagi et al [107] demonstrated that near infrared laser acts as an adjuvant to vaccination and significantly increases immune responses to intradermal influenza vaccination without augmenting Immunoglobulin-E. This conferred increased protection compared to an unadjuvanted vaccine control in a mouse influenza lethal challenge model. Thus, it is an exciting hypothesis for PBM to act as a noninvasive, risk-free and easily deployed adjuvant therapy, especially for at-risk populations.COVID-19 is not only a major challenge in people with comorbidities that affect their immune and inflammatory status, but is also particularly aggressive in the elderly, who have the compounding problems of an aging immune response, increased baseline inflammation, increased mitochondrial dysfunction and decreasing microbial diversity in their gut microbiome. PBM therapy is worthy of further rapid evaluation and could offer a safe, noninvasive, side-effect free and easily deployed adjunctive treatment and prevention, particularly suited for the most at-risk populations. Studies to evaluate the role of PBM in combatting COVID-19 infection and disease prevention may ultimately not only benefit the elderly and chronically sick but could have larger ramifications as a low risk, low-cost intervention in the prevention, treatment and healing of a variety of conditions. This may have implications for the most vulnerable individuals impacted by COVID-19, especially the elderly, infected with the virus, those who are slow to recover from the effects of the infection and those who have been denied their normal exercise/rehabilitation programs due to the necessary isolation restrictions.AL, BB and WM are founders and employees of SYMBYX Pty Ltd, a medical technology company that develops photobiomodulation devices to treat metabolic and neurodegenerative conditions.",Australia,first author,2020-12-01,12
2cc8718af9e11e67ab188ba1433f75f37c1a7b8d,A Review of the Current Status of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Australia-The Clinical Impact of Changing Population Demographics and Diagnostic Criteria on Prevalence,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common medical complications of pregnancy in Australia. The increase in maternal overweight and obesity, advancing maternal age, ""at risk"" ethnic group representation and the change in diagnostic processes and criteria (summarized in Table 1 ) from the previous Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society (ADIPS) criteria [1] to those recommended by the International Association of the Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) and endorsed in 2013 by the World Health Organization [1] have all contributed to a dramatic increase in the prevalence of GDM in Australia. The aim of introducing more widespread testing and uniform criteria for GDM was to improve maternal and foetal outcomes, as suggested by the landmark Crowther [3] and Landon [4] randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, increased rates of GDM diagnosis may also contribute to potential physical and psychological morbidity for the mother and physical morbidity for the child and unfortunately, this may be compounded by an unmet resource gap, as resources may not be available to provide ""best practice"" care for all GDM women.There are both immediate and long-term clinical and health economic advantages and burdens which need to be clearly balanced when considering GDM [5] . The balancing of needs and outcomes provides an opportunity for innovative thinking around how we deliver care and how we acutely respond to unexpected world events, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic [6] .The authors conducted PubMed and Medline searches using the terms: GDM, Australia, screening, models of care and postnatal follow up to gather information for this review. Articles were selected to specifically represent Australian cohorts and data for an Australian perspective. Australian prevalence data were drawn directly from the National Diabetes Service Scheme (NDSS) (which registers all Australian residents with a diagnosis of gestational diabetes who receive access to government subsidies for the purpose of diabetes care) and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare website. [7] This review examined the prevalence of GDM in Australia since the adoption of the IADPSG diagnostic criteria (officially 1 January 2015, but variable across the country). Universal screening is recommended for pregnant women, not previously diagnosed with hyperglycaemia, and between 24 and 28 weeks gestation [8] . This highlights the distinctive local Australian challenges of delivering care to geographically isolated women across vast distances and the specific needs and concerns of our First Nation women. This reviews the current models of care and considers how we might cater for women with cultural and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Finally, it addresses the current COVID-19 screening situation and the need for improved post-natal care.A recent position statement released by Diabetes Australia [9] reports that almost 41,000 Australian women were diagnosed with GDM in 2019 (refer to Figure 1 below), one fifth of whom presenting with a repeat diagnosis. Approximately 300,000 babies were born in Australia in 2018 [10] , so this equates to around 14% of Australian gravidas being currently classified as having GDM. There is, however, enormous variability between regions in Australia which is discussed further below. International prevalence data drawn from Brown et al. [11] in 2017 also show the high variability of GDM rates ranging from single digit prevalence in Japan, to over 25% of pregnancies affected in California and greater than 45% in the United Arab Emirates.With a doubling of the number of affected women in the last decade, GDM is the fastest growing subtype of diabetes in Australia [9] . The rapid increase in the prevalence of GDM is multifactorial and complex, with high variability based on ethnic representation, obesity rates and maternal age. Almost half of pregnant women in Australian are now classified as being overweight or obese. Cheney et al. [12] addressed the contribution of rising maternal BMI (Body Mass Index kg/m 2 ) to GDM by analysing a large data subset of 9245 women from a single maternity centre in Sydney during the period 2010-2014. Cheney found that the population attributable fraction (PAF) for GDM attributable to women being overweight or obese was 17%.In the last two decades, the average maternal age has also increased by more than 4 years and the number of women with ethnic backgrounds at a higher risk of GDM (in particular those born in southern and central Asia, Southeast Asia, North Africa and the Middle East) has doubled [7] . A change in diagnostic criteria has also had a significant impact and continues to be a point of contention and consideration in Australia. Traditionally in Australia, GDM was diagnosed using a fasting 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), with or without prior non-fasting ""glucose load"" testing. As summarized in Table 1 , diagnostic thresholds of 5.5 mmol/L fasting and 8.0 mmol/L at 2 h on the OGTT were set empirically by an ""ad hoc working party"" in 1991 [2] and although their evidence base was thin, these criteria were widely used from 1991 to 2015.Following the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study findings, the IADPSG proposed new diagnostic criteria in 2010 [13] . These were endorsed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) [1] and the Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society (ADIPS) in 2014 [14] . These ""IADPSG/WHO2013"" criteria were adopted by more than 90% of Australian maternity providers and have been in use in the authors' home state of Queensland since January 2015 [15] .In previous as well as current diagnostic criteria for GDM in Australia, all values relate to glucose concentrations at the oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) before or after the ingestion of 75 g of glucose in the fasting state. The ADIPS 1991 guidelines recommended two-step testing with an initial non-fasting glucose load (50 or 75 g). A full OGTT was recommended if venous plasma glucose was 7.8 mmol/L 1 h after a 50 g load or 8.0 mmol/L 1 h after a 75 g load. The current criteria do not recommend two-step testing.Whilst a change in GDM diagnostic criteria had a significant impact in specific patient cohorts, Figure 1 demonstrates that a national upward trend in GDM prevalence was already evident prior to the implementation of the IADPSG guidelines. This trajectory has continued after the change to IADPSG/WHO2013 diagnostic criteria post-2015.A recent publication by Brown et al. [16] reviewed 112,308 confinements over 10 years in an ethnically diverse health district in Sydney. Interestingly, their data showed a sharp increase in the prevalence of GDM in 2013, before changes to diagnostic processes and criteria were implemented. This was particularly evident in women of South Asian origin and was unrelated to changes in BMI in that cohort of women over the study period. A change in diagnostic criteria has also had a significant impact and continues to be a point of contention and consideration in Australia. Traditionally in Australia, GDM was diagnosed using a fasting 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), with or without prior non-fasting ""glucose load"" testing. As summarized in Table 1 , diagnostic thresholds of ≥5.5 mmol/L fasting and ≥8.0 mmol/L at 2 h on the OGTT were set empirically by an ""ad hoc working party"" in 1991 [2] and although their evidence base was thin, these criteria were widely used from 1991 to 2015.Following the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study findings, the IADPSG proposed new diagnostic criteria in 2010 [13] . These were endorsed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) [1] and the Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society (ADIPS) in 2014 [14] .

The current criteria do not recommend two-step testing.Whilst a change in GDM diagnostic criteria had a significant impact in specific patient cohorts, Figure 1 demonstrates that a national upward trend in GDM prevalence was already evident prior to the implementation of the IADPSG guidelines. This trajectory has continued after the change to IADPSG/WHO2013 diagnostic criteria post-2015.A recent publication by Brown et al. [16] reviewed 112,308 confinements over 10 years in an ethnically diverse health district in Sydney. Interestingly, their data showed a sharp increase in the prevalence of GDM in 2013, before changes to diagnostic processes and criteria were implemented. This was particularly evident in women of South Asian origin and was unrelated to changes in BMI in that cohort of women over the study period.In a publication in 2016, Moses et al. [17] assessed the impact of the IADPSG/WHO2013 criteria on GDM prevalence using public and private maternity patient data in southern New South Wales. They concluded that the new criteria resulted in one-third more women diagnosed with GDM when compared with the previous ADIPS criteria. Elevated fasting glucose contributed to the majority (56%) of GDM diagnoses.The local impact of the screening changes has been measured and published from several other metropolitan and regional centres and their research findings are summarised below.In 2018, a published retrospective audit conducted at Townsville Hospital [18] , a regional centre in Queensland, considered the impact of changing to the IADPSG diagnostic criteria in 2015. This analysis was performed using patient data for 6 months in 2014 pre-adoption and again in the 2015 post-adoption phase. The authors reported a doubling in the incidence of GDM using the new IADPSG diagnostic criteria (from 9.8% pre-to 19.6% post-adoption, p < 0.01).Similarly, Cade et al. [19] performed a pre-and post-change of criteria assessment in Melbourne, Victoria. The incidence of GDM rose from 5.93% pre-IADPSG adoption to 10.3% post-adoption. They did not show an improvement in the maternal or neonatal outcomes post-adoption and demonstrated an increased net cost of care due to the substantially increased number of women diagnosed with GDM.In addition, Cheung et al. [20] also published 2018 a retrospective cohort study which was performed in Western Sydney pre-(2014) and post-(2016) the implementation of universal screening, based on the ADIPS 1991 [2] criteria which were restated in 1998. A comparison was then made between the ADIPS1998 criteria and the IADPSG criteria reviewing prevalence, perinatal outcomes and the independent influence of obesity in this cohort. The reported outcomes included: an increase in prevalence of only 2.7% (very modest when compared with co-located health districts), a significant and independent association between maternal obesity and adverse pregnancy outcomes (regardless of which diagnostic criteria were used) and the relative risk of ethnicity on the positivity of screening. They found a higher risk of GDM using IADPSG criteria in women of Asian and Middle Eastern background, with lower risk noted for women of North and South America and European background.Similarly, Wong et al. [21] looked at GDM prevalence variation due to ethnicity and obesity in their culturally diverse maternity population in Western Sydney. Their findings showed an overall doubling of prevalence in GDM using the IADPSG criteria (14.5 to 29.6%), however, in the subgroup analysis, the prevalence in women from East/South-East Asia increased the least (19.2 to 22.3%) and the prevalence in women from South Asia the most (22.0 to 44.4%). The prevalence of GDM in obese women (BMI > 30 kg/m 2 ) was substantial at 45.9%.A recently published Queensland retrospective cohort study [22] of GDM prevalence and pregnancy outcomes pre-and post-the implementation of the (IADPSG) diagnostic criteria revealed that GDM rates increased state-wide from 8.7 to 11.9% post-implementation. This report assessed the perinatal data the year before (2014) and the year following (2016) Queensland's move to one step screening and diagnosis of GDM according to IADPSG criteria. Each historical cohort included more than 60,000 women. Perinatal outcomes of interest were defined as gestational hypertension, caesarean birth, gestational age at delivery, birthweight, preterm delivery, large-for-gestational age (LGA) neonates, small-for -gestational age (SGA) neonates, neonatal hypoglycaemia, and respiratory distress. The authors reported a very small decrease in neonatal respiratory distress without significant changes in other perinatal outcomes post-implementation. The authors considered positive impactors including an (independent) improved detection of neonatal hypoglycaemia during this time period, and negative impactors such as increased maternal BMI and the inadequate resourcing of care as possible confounders for the lack of discernible improvement in neonatal outcomes. However, we note that assessing overall outcomes on a population basis is unlikely to show significant changes. In this report, the absolute increase in GDM frequency was 3.2% and only these women would have received different treatment in the two study periods. By contrast, around 88% of women would have been considered as ""non GDM"" in both study periods and would thus have received similar care either before or after the changes in diagnostic processes and criteria were implemented.Predictably, the direct impact of the introduction of the IADPSG criteria on GDM prevalence was influenced by several factors. Rapid changes in the ethnic diversity of childbearing women in certain regions, increasing maternal age and maternal BMI will have a variable impact depending on which population is assessed. The impact will fluctuate between regional, remote and metropolitan areas across the nation. This substantial variability adds to the complexity of screening but also imposes an inequitable burden and challenge in delivering GDM care for some health districts.Australia has some unique challenges in managing GDM ranging from the geographical location of ""at risk"" women, to screening procedures, and remote treatment strategies. Regarding ""at risk"" women, First Nation mothers are not only more likely to develop GDM than non-indigenous women, but also have far higher pregnancy complication rates.The Pregnancy and Neonatal Diabetes Outcomes in Remote Australia (PANDORA) study [23] , an observational study in the Northern Territory, has revealed high rates of diabetes with a preponderance of pre-gestational diabetes in indigenous women, when compared with their non-indigenous counterparts. In this cohort, indigenous mothers were younger and had higher smoking rates, and in the GDM/DIP (diabetes in pregnancy) subgroup, they suffered poorer birth outcomes with an increased proportion of large for gestational age (LGA) babies (19 vs. 11%).Due to Australia's immense land mass, women who reside in remote and rural areas have limited access to diagnosis, education and specialist management of GDM. Their ""at risk"" status due to geographic isolation is compounded by indigenous or another ""at risk"" ethnicity, higher rates of elevated BMI and social disadvantage including limited access to fresh food and healthy eating options [24] .Following the identification of and access to these ""at risk"" remote population, the next barrier is accurate laboratory testing. Between 2015 and 2018, the Optimisation of Rural Clinical and Haematological Indicators for Diabetes in Pregnancy (ORCHID) study [25] cohort was recruited in rural Western Australia. This study was conducted to address concerns about geographically mandated long delays between the time of venesection at various remote sites to the centralized laboratory facilities, focusing on the issue of pre-analytic glucose degradation (due to in-sample glycolysis). There were concerns that this could lead to the under diagnosis of GDM in an ""at risk"" group. The authors assessed the potential impact of alternate pre-analytical protocols to minimise glycolysis. Most OGTT samples were stored at room temperature and 92% (461/501) had a substantial delay before analysis; median 5 h, range 2.3-124 h. The authors estimated that 62% of potential GDM diagnoses were missed amongst regional, rural and remote Western Australian women by the 24-28 week OGTT. This is due to the suboptimal sample processing issues, with the greatest preanalytical error relating to the measurement of fasting venous plasma glucose. In a small subset of their cohort, they demonstrated that changing their pre-analytic sampling procedures, by storing samples in an ice-water slurry (following the protocol used in the HAPO study), was able to prevent much of the in-sample glycolysis. However, this was considered impractical for routine clinical use. By contrast, the use of fluoride citrate tubes without cooling was also able to prevent in sample glycolysis, but led to a systematic increase in laboratory glucose measurements of 0.2 mmol/L. This in turn led to an approximately doubled GDM prevalence, predominantly due to elevations in fasting glucose values. They suggested that laboratories could potentially correct for this difference by the systematic subtraction of 0.2 mmol/L from their analytic results, giving results comparable with those obtained with HAPO-aligned methods.Concern regarding the pre-analytical handling of blood for OGTTs was also raised by a group in the Australian Capital Territory, with no geographical barriers. These authors reported a prevalence difference of 9% (20.6 vs. 11.6%) between protocols using early centrifugation vs. delayed centrifuge of glucose samples from the OGTT [26] .Thus, there is both a major challenge and a potential opportunity to define and implement better pre-analytical handling of OGTT specimens both remotely and regionally in Australia to improve diagnostic accuracy.Once identified and diagnosed, women with GDM then have variable access to expert care dependent on their geographical location. To address this concern, the Australian health system needs to focus on innovative technological solutions including opportunities to provide more care via digital platforms and Telehealth. In recent practice, such platforms were rapidly deployed and effectively utilised in many regions during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period for both family and specialist medical care. Research into the use and efficacy of digital solutions in Australia is lacking and an opportunity exists to further develop the potential use of these techniques in routine clinical practice.Increased rates of GDM carry an obvious physical and emotional burden for the affected women themselves, as well as higher risks of immediate and longer-term morbidity for both the mothers and their babies and the health economic burden for the management of the affected dyad. The other significant burden falls to the health practitioners trying to provide optimal care for this ever-increasing cohort of women. Traditional models of care for women with GDM are not sustainable, with the major limitations being inadequate funding and inadequate numbers of trained health care providers. Unfortunately, additional funding and staffing has not been forthcoming in the current economic climate and due to the variability of population demographic, management solutions are unlikely to be generalisable.Sina et al. [27] undertook a thematic analysis from 15 volunteer diabetes in pregnancy services from Australia and New Zealand in 2018. Their report highlights not only the difficulty of dealing with increased patient numbers in a traditional model of care, but also the complexity of delivering appropriate care in remote, rural, urban and metropolitan settings and for women with culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds. The prevalence of GDM in this analysis ranged between 10.4% in metropolitan Victoria to 26.9% in peri-urban Queensland.All clinics reported that they provided initial group education classes for GDM women run by a credentialed diabetes educator and dietitian and a subsequent individual session for each patient. Commonly, women were provided with a contact phone number to call if the blood glucose levels were out of range. At this point, and no doubt due to the workload, most clinics provided a ""step-up"" option, where only women with self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) out of range receive ongoing care from a diabetes educator or endocrinologist. This resulted in most women remaining with their primary antenatal team, which has some potential benefits in terms of the continuity of care. However, either the primary maternity provider or the woman herself must then take the role of a diabetes advocate-seeking an escalation of care when required. Experience tells us that often the women with the least health literacy or self-advocacy have the greatest need for care. In light of this, models of care need to accommodate all women including those with literacy and language difficulties, those with adherence concerns and women with accessibility disadvantages. From the thematic analysis reported in this paper, common challenges included: busy clinics, lack of coordination between obstetric and diabetes care, CALD, large numbers of GDM women requiring insulin and difficulties in delivering services to patients from rural and remote areas. Proposed solutions included: alteration in traditional models of care, step-up and step-down models, interdisciplinary and midwifery champion approaches, on site interpreters, and technology solutions including portals and telehealth.Digital monitoring and telehealth provision of care have distinct advantages in overcoming some of the geographical and workflow barriers for delivering care. Studies dating back 10 years report high patient acceptability for web-based interventions in GDM. Despite their low-income status, most women had and have access to smart phones and/or computers and report this as their preferred medium for learning. [28] Mobile (smartphone) health solutions are a suitable option for GDM care due to the nature of monitoring, transmitting blood glucose readings from a meter, to phone, to a clinician portal. Education can also be provided digitally in the form of video or teleconferencing mediums. Such a web-based educational intervention was trialled in a multi-ethnic cohort in metropolitan Melbourne [28] with an intervention aimed at a low level of literacy but delivered in English. The three domains assessed were knowledge of GDM, food values and GDM self-management principles. The authors reported the intervention as successful in the first domain with over 70% of women improving their knowledge scores post-intervention. The sample size was small (n = 21) and the authors commented on the comprehension issues with the questionnaire relating to the second and third domains. Language-specific education was proposed for a subsequent trial.The next challenge is how to meet the treatment needs of GDM women. The time-critical nature of pregnancy care means that therapy must be delivered promptly and the highly variable population demographics of pregnant women in Australia mean that the treatment must be adapted to a wide range of cultural and linguistic contexts. Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) remains the foundation of the initial and in many cases ongoing management of GDM. The aims of MNT include meeting the nutritional needs of the mother and baby, and the attainment and maintenance of glycaemic targets.However, an important risk factor for GDM is ethnic origin. More than 25% of the Australian population are first generation migrants, 7.6% of Chinese origin. Of birthing mothers, more than a third were born overseas, most commonly from India, China and New Zealand [10] .As the foundation of GDM care, MNT education must therefore be culturally appropriate for multiple ethnic groups. As previously mentioned, all the models of care surveyed in Australasia used group education for teaching on GDM and MNT. Wan et al. [29] performed a mixed methods study in metropolitan Melbourne comparing the perceptions and experiences of dietary self-management and nutritional needs of ethnic Chinese women (n = 44) and Australian born white women (n = 39). The authors discovered that while all the white participants expressed satisfaction with the GDM teaching, most first-generation migrant Chinese participants indicated a strong preference for detailed, prescriptive, brand-orientated advice. Of concern, half the Chinese participants engaged in restrictive eating behaviours to reduce errors and improve self-management. Twelve of the 44 Chinese women experienced hunger, compared with two of the 39 white women.A 2015 review article from Liverpool, Sydney [30] , also highlighted the challenges of delivering MNT in a GDM service to women of CALD backgrounds. These authors proposed culturally sensitive treatment including tailored MNT and an individualised approach to insulin prescription, citing the significant variation in insulin requirement between ethnicities.Considering differing potential approaches to GDM education, a cohort of GDM women was assessed in an ethnically diverse part of Sydney, pre-IADPSG adoption [31] . Of the 743 women included, approximately half received group education for MNT and half individual education appointments. The group education participants had a small but statistically significantly lower HbA1c at diagnosis but the groups were otherwise well matched for baseline characteristics. The content of the dietary education provided was the same for both group and individual education. Subsequently, these authors reported an increased requirement for insulin in the education group (42 vs. 34.6%) and multivariable logistic regression defined ""group women"" as a predictor of insulin use. Perinatal outcomes were similar.Updated NDSS data demonstrate an overall proportion of insulin use of 33.8% in 2019. With approximately 14,000 women requiring insulin therapy per year, MNT interventions which reduce the requirement for pharmacotherapy are potentially very attractive and merit specific funding. The most commonly used oral hypoglycaemic medication for gestational diabetes mellitus in Australia is Metformin, however, its use varies widely between centres, with some preferring insulin therapy alone. The NDSS data do not provide metformin use as a separate measure (many women will be co-prescribed Metformin and insulin therapy) and therefore an accurate assessment of the Australia-wide prevalence of use is not currently available. Some individual centres have published their clinical experience using Metformin. The main focus of these articles pertains to neonatal and maternal outcomes following Metformin therapy. Maple-Brown et al. [32] in the Northern Territory have reported prevalence data of 42-48% Metformin use in indigenous women with GDM and Diabetes in Pregnancy (DIP) and 14-35% in non-indigenous women with GDM/DIP, in an observational study during the period 2012-2016.Compounding the challenges of increasing prevalence, maternal obesity, advancing maternal age and unmet and unmanageable clinical needs, another dramatic and unexpected influence has been the current worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. In line with multiple international bodies [6] and with the aim of reducing COVID-19 transmission by person to person contact, Australia temporarily revised the recommendations for GDM testing processes and criteria. The COVID-19 revisions included a two-step process with an initial fasting glucose followed by the selective use of OGTTs: fasting glucose of ≥4.6 mmol/L does not require further testing, ≥5.1 mmol/L diagnoses GDM. Moreover, 4.7 mmol/L-5.0 mmol/L requires a full OGTT [33] . Van Gemert et al analysed the proportion of potentially missed diagnoses using this system and 6 years of OGTT data from the Illawarra region, in southern New South Wales [34] . Overall, 16,263 OGTTs were analysed and 1992 patients were diagnosed with GDM, giving a prevalence of 12.2%. Of these GDM women, 29% had a fasting level ≤4.6 mmol/L and would have been missed by the revised COVID-19 screening practice. The authors extrapolated that a fasting glucose cut off of <4.0 mmol/L would be required for a 95% confidence in exclusion of GDM. However, beyond the question of simple GDM frequency, a further secondary analysis of HAPO data from a multi-ethnic cohort involving five HAPO centres has reported that complications including LGA infants and operative birth are less frequent in those women who achieve a GDM diagnosis due to elevated 1 or 2h OGTT glucose but have a fasting glucose <4.7 mmol/L [35] . Therefore, the use of fasting glucose as a first step in GDM assessment may be warranted even after the COVID-19 pandemic. We acknowledge that all changes in GDM diagnostic strategies in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic were made on an empirical basis and that they have not been recommended for ongoing utilization outside this context. Further assessment of the perinatal outcomes using any revised screening programme is required before changes are made to the recommended testing protocols.A post-natal follow up OGTT for GDM women is recommended in Australia at 6-12 weeks post partum. The responsibility for this usually falls to the woman's general practitioner, however, adherence to this testing protocol is known to be suboptimal. Due to their higher risk nature, GDM pregnancies are usually managed in a hospital-led maternity model. Therefore, the general practitioner may not have seen the woman in her pregnancy or even be aware of her diagnosis [36] . Poor follow-up rates are seen despite Diabetes Australia sending reminder letters upon registration of GDM, at 12 weeks post partum and annually thereafter. Many contributory factors and barriers have been proposed, including poor communication from the maternity team at discharge, a lack of patient awareness about the potential risk of type 2 diabetes and reassurance of GDM ""resolving"" post partum [37] . Communication issues are evident not only in metropolitan centres [37] but also in our remote communities, with similar issues highlighted in a qualitative review of diabetes in pregnancy care in the remote Northern Territory [38] .GDM prevalence is clearly increasing across Australia. Important factors contributing to this increase are universal testing, the increased representation of higher risk ethnic groups amongst pregnant women, older age at childbirth, rising rates of maternal overweight and obesity, the population increase in all types of diabetes and the change to ""one-step"" IADPSG/WHO2013 diagnostic processes and criteria. Australia continues to attempt to assess and address the expanding need for GDM management with particular reference to ""at risk"" women, those with limited access to expert care and those with CALD needs. Practitioners involved in the care of women with GDM continue to debate, test and collaborate in many ways in an attempt develop pragmatic solutions to improve GDM diagnosis, management and prevention. With innovative solutions, education and awareness, we are well placed to respond to the challenges of 2020 and beyond.Author Contributions: Both J.GL. and H.D.M. contributed to the literature review, construction, writing and editing of the article.

Infections are leading to unprecedented numbers of cases of severe respiratory illness with significant proportions of patients requiring admission to intensive care units (ICU) [2] . COVID-19 is associated with a high transmission rate and without adequately effective therapies rising numbers of cases of respiratory distress are threatening to overwhelm global healthcare capacity. Interventions are urgently required to reduce this disease burden leading to the accelerated introduction into clinical development of at least 47 vaccine candidates [3] .We report the interim analysis of the first stage of a phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of SCB-2019. The trial was done in one study centre in Nedlands, Western Australia, Australia from June 19, 2020 until database lock on October 20, 2020.The study protocol was approved by the study centre Institutional Review Board and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier NCT04405908). The study was done according to International Conference of Harmonisation and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.The overall objectives were to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of three increasing dosages of SCB-2019, unadjuvanted or adjuvanted with AS03 or CpG/Alum, in young and older adults when administered as two intramuscular doses 21 days apart.Eligible participants were adults of either sex from 18 to 75 years of age who were healthy at enrolment based on medical history and medical assessment. All volunteers were screened for serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as evidence of prior infection, and for acute exposure using reverse transcriptase-polymer chain reaction (RT-PCR), which were repeated at each study visit. Inclusion criteria included being able to provide informed consent, having a BMI between 18·5 and 35·0 kg/m 2 , being able to understand and sign the informed consent and being available for the duration of the study (6 months) . Female participants of childbearing potential were not to be pregnant or breastfeeding and had to agree to use protocol-approved forms of contraception until 6 months after the first vaccination. Men were also to use a protocol-approved form of contraception from the day of first vaccination until 6 months after the first vaccination and refrain from donating sperm over the same period.Participants were assigned a study number at enrolment and vaccinated according to a randomisation list prepared by the study sponsor. All participants and personnel involved in safety data collection and immunogenicity assessments were blinded to the study treatment.Vaccine preparation and administration were performed by different unblinded study personnel, using opacified syringes to maintain the participant blind as the vaccine and placebo are visually different.During study conduct a safety monitoring committee continuously assessed safety data with the option to authorise use of stopping/pausing rules predefined in the protocol.All study participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at each study visit. If a participant was suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus or had confirmed COVID-19 between study visits, the participant was requested to have an additional test for SARS-CoV-2 infection.There was no formal statistical hypothesis in this phase 1 study and all data summaries are presented descriptively by group. The study sample size was not based on any statistical hypothesis but is typical of such phase 1 studies and was considered to be adequate to provide a preliminary assessment of vaccine safety and reactogenicity in each cohort.The Safety Analysis Set (SAS) consists of all subjects randomised to receive at least one dose of study vaccine or placebo, analysed according to the treatment they actually received.Reported summary statistics include counts and percentage of participants who reported at least one solicited local reactions and systemic AEs and unsolicited AEs (with severity and causality), and SAEs and AESIs, after the first and second doses. For this report, the safety data for all participants with at least 21-day safety follow up after Dose 1 are included.A total of 329 volunteers were screened, of whom 151 (91 young adults and 60 older adults) were enrolled in their respective age strata after testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 (figure 1).The majority of the screen failures (173 of 178 [97%]) were due to exclusion criteria. One adult assigned to the 30 μg SCB-2019 group who withdrew before receiving any vaccination was replaced with another volunteer. Demographics were similar across groups (table 1). In the young adult groups the mean age of all SCB-2019 recipients was 36·2 ± 11·5 years vs.32·6 ± 10·7 years for placebo recipients, 40% were male, and most described themselves as white and neither Hispanic nor Latino. In older adults the mean age was 61·1 ± 4·9 years in vaccinees and 62·3 ± 5·9 years in placebo controls, 47% were male, and all were white.There were no deaths or hospitalisations during the study, and only two SAEs both in older adults. One older adult was diagnosed with cellulitis following a cat bite but completed the study, while another had hyponatraemia after receiving one dose in the 9 μg CpG/Alum group and was withdrawn from the study (figure 1). The participant was subsequently found to have a pituitary adenoma, which is a known to potentially cause hyponatremia [12] [13] [14] .After the first dose of plain SCB-2019 solicited systemic AEs were infrequent and similar to placebo in the 3 μg and 9 μg groups, but 50% of the 30 μg group reported Grade 1 or 2 AEs.These rates were lower after the second doses (figure 2). In contrast, when formulated with AS03 the frequency of systemic AEs was higher and not dose-dependent, reported by 25-38% per group after the first dose and 44-56% after the second dose with a concomitant increase in the proportion described as Grade 2. Two participants, one each in the 9 μg and 30 μg groups, reported Grade 3 fatigue and myalgia. The most frequently reported systemic adverse events were headache, fatigue, and myalgia, with six reports of fever, all Grade 1 or 2 after the second dose of SCB-2019+AS03. Systemic AE rates in those who received SCB-2019+CpG/Alum were similar to the SCB-2019+AS03 group after the first dose, but there was no consistent trend to increase frequency or severity after the second dose. As with local AEs, the frequency of reported systemic AEs was lower in older adults after their first dose (17%) than the younger adults (38%), and overall rates were similar after second doses, 30%Dose-dependent increases in neutralising activity were also observed in the SCB-2019+CpG/Alum groups, but these responses were lower in magnitude than the AS03 groups as illustrated in figure 5 . In the older adult groups the range of MN50 GMTs (123-263) appeared lower than in the convalescent sera. High titres were maintained up to Day 50, the last timepoint tested in this interim analysis.When adjuvanted with CpG and Alum, the immune responses were lower than with AS03 and SCB-2019 dose-dependent. Further, the response to SCB-2019+CpG/Alum were lower in the older age group. Further investigation of the cellular immune responses showed increases in Th1-polarised responses after both first and second doses for both AS03adjuvanted and CpG/Alum-adjuvanted SCB-2019. CD4+ T-cell responses have been suggested to complement humoral antibody responses in overcoming SARS-CoV-2 infection [19] .MD, BM, BH, IS, PL, PL, HHH and JL are full-time employees and RC is a scientific advisor of the study sponsor, PR declares no conflict of interest.We are grateful to all the volunteers and the study staff at Nedlands, Western Australia.

Eight two-fold serial dilutions of serum samples starting from a 1:25 initial dilution were added to the blocked and washed SCB-2019-coated plates and incubated for 1h at 37°C. Plates were then washed, incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG for 1 hr at 37°C, washed again and the colorimetric signals were developed using TMB substrate for 3 min before stopping the reaction with 1N sulfuric acid. Optical density (OD) was measured at 450/650 nm. The EC50 of each test sample was calculated using a non-linear four parameter regression curve using GraphPad Prism, v.6.0c.Serum samples were heat inactivated for 30 minutes at 56⁰C and eleven two-fold serial dilutions of test samples were prepared in a separate dilution plate. Sera were mixed with an equal volume of SARS-CoV-2, hCoV-19/Australia/VIC01/2020 (GenBank MT007544.1), and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C, 5% CO2. The virus/serum mixtures (200 TCID50 units/well) were then transferred in duplicate to sub-confluent Vero E6 cell monolayer plates, preseeded 24 hours beforehand in 96 well plates at 1·5 x 10 4 cells/well. Plates were incubated for 3 days at 37°C, 5% CO2. The residual non-neutralised virus was detected via cytopathic effect (CPE) by microscopic scoring. The neutralisation titre is expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution at which 50% of the replicate wells were protected from infection (MN50). If at least 50% protection was not observed for an individual serum sample at any dilution, the MN50 titre was recorded as <20.",Australia,first author,2020-12-04,12
17761d2312188477df833b45ce68dc8ed825431a,Gene expression profiling of SARS-CoV-2 infections reveal distinct primary lung cell and systemic immune infection responses that identify pathways relevant in COVID-19 disease,"The current global pandemic of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing a severe respiratory disease designated as COVID-19, has as of mid-August 2020 infected >21 million people and caused >750,000 deaths globally [1] . The highly infectious and widespread nature of the disease is attributed in part to its asymptomatic spread, in contrast to earlier pandemic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which were more easily contained as symptom onset co-occurred with infectivity [2] .The development and spread of the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 has vastly outpaced the rate of vaccine and therapeutic development. Nevertheless, the global research community has rallied; within weeks of the first observations of COVID-19, the virus was isolated and characterised. Central to effective therapy and vaccine development is an improved understanding of the cellular pathway and transcriptional responses to infection in human cells. These are currently very poorly characterised, both in the early stage of infection, as viral load increases before symptom onset; as well as in the later stage of COVID-19 pneumonia, which is associated with a severe cytokine and inflammatory storm in affected patients. It remains a mystery why only a small proportion become severely ill, while a proportion of infected people harbour asymptomatic infections making them difficult to identify [2] .To address these issues and clarify cell signalling pathways affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, we applied a suite of computational and bioinformatics approaches using SARS-CoV-2 genomic and transcriptomic data. We started by comparing SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and influenza A strains H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 viral genomes, and assessed the effect of infection on transcriptional responses in human lung epithelial cells [3] [4] [5] . This enabled us to characterise a novel set of SARS-CoV-2 acute response genes. On this set of genes, we performed extensive cell signalling pathway and predictive analyses. These assessed gene ontologies and cell signalling cascades associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cells, which enabled us to identify clinically approved drugs [6] that affect aspects of the early cell response to the viral infection, some of which may be of therapeutic relevance. Having identified the distinct transcriptional responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed bioinformatics validation studies to determine whether these SARS-CoV-2 response genes and pathways are associated with comorbid lung disease, and share concordant signalling pathway responses with the systemic immune response evident in COVID-19 human patient blood samples.We first compared the viral phylogenetic tree of known pandemic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2), as well as pandemic influenza A strains (H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1). We found that SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and as expected, these showed significant divergence from the influenza viruses examined ( Figure 1A ). RNAseq gene expression profiling of human lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and influenza strains for 24 h revealed a surprisingly sparse overlapping gene expression signature ( Figure 1B-C) . This is an observation of key importance; despite their close phylogenetic relationship, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 induces a very different transcriptional response in the host cells compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with majority of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) distinct to the SARS-CoV-2 set ( Figure 1B ). There was no evident relationship between phylogenetic and gene expression relationships, consistent with the notion that COVID-19 is a quite different disease entity (at least in its initial stages of development) to those resulting from the earlier coronaviruses. A similar conclusion was reached when we compared SARS-CoV-2 and influenza-induced gene expression changes in human lung epithelial cells ( Figure 1C ). For this reason, we then focussed exclusively on the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and pathway data to gain insights into early COVID-19 development.To understand the magnitude of the unique transcriptional effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we stringently assessed DEGs using a cut-off threshold of absolute log 2 fold change (LFC) >1, with an adjusted P value <0.05 for initial analyses. Heat map visualisation shows the striking nature of the unique transcriptional signature induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2A ). Of the top 108 SARS-CoV-2 infection response genes, >85% were significantly upregulated compared to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and influenza virus infections ( Figure 2A) . Notably, the top 40 SARS-CoV-2 infection response genes show particularly striking upregulation compared to the other viruses ( Figure 2B ). Using a more stringent cut-off threshold of absolute log fold change >2, there was evident strong upregulation of a unique suite of inflammatory response genes upon SARS-CoV-2 infection; these included interferon response genes IFI44L, IFI27 and IFI6, interleukins IL6 and Interleukin 8 (IL8), and chemokine and complement gene activation ( Figure 2C ).Collectively, these data further confirm that although the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome is closely related to previous pandemic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genomes, the transcriptional responses to infection in human lung epithelial cells are markedly different. Similarly, comparing the infection responses of pandemic influenza strains H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 with SARS-CoV-2 indicates SARS-CoV-2 infection responses in human lung epithelial cells remain unique at the gene expression level.After establishing the unique differential expression profile associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells, we conducted thorough gene ontology and cell signalling pathway analyses using several curated databases (The Gene Ontology, WikiPathways, BioCarta, Reactome and Panther databases). Assigning significant gene ontologies to SARS-CoV-2 infection found cytokine and interferon cellular responses dominate the infection profile ( Figure 3A) . Notably, type 1 interferon response and cytokine inflammatory terms were the most enriched, in line with our differential gene expression analysis ( Figure 2) . Only a small number of viral replication and viral life cycle terms were found significant (Figure 2A and B); this likely reflects the acute nature of the 24 h infection time point used. Cell signalling pathway analyses similarly found striking enrichment of inflammatory interleukin, TNF-alpha and interferon-mediated signalling effects in host cells, distinct from response terms driven by either bacterial or viral infection ( Figure 3B ).To aid in contextualising our findings of a unique SARS-CoV-2 infection gene signature and to provide some external validation, we conducted an extensive Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) viral literature screen ( Figure 4A ). Analysing all the publically available viral infection literature in the GEO found infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 matched most closely to studies of SARS-CoV infection, as well as respiration syncytial virus infection between 48 and 72 h ( Figure 4A ). This is of particular significance, as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and respiration syncytial virus all cause significant lower respiratory tract infections in humans.Next, to understand how the SARS-CoV-2 gene set analysis matched to the actions of previously characterised drugs, we conducted a Drug Signatures Database screen using DSigDB [6] . At an adjusted P value significance cut-off of <0.05, DSigDB screening matched over 600 agents as interacting with SARS-CoV-2 gene signature elements (Supplementary table) . While many of these are challenging to interpret or understand in a translational context, they provide insight in terms of broad cell signalling pathways and/or factors that may prove clinically relevant upon further investigation. For example, our analysis predicts several agents with broad anti-inflammatory and TNF-alpha inhibitory effects; including cytochalasin D (P < 0.0001), 1 ′ -acetoxychavicol acetate (P < 0.0001) and statins such as atorvastatin (P < 0.01) ( Figure 4B ), which are associated with increased survival following infections due to antiinflammatory effects [7] . Of additional note are the agents proline dithiocarbamate (P < 0.0001), and dicumarol (P < 0.01); inhibitors having anti-angiogenic and anti-coagulation effects [8, 9] . These mechanisms may prove relevant to COVID-19 pneumonia, with reports emerging of significant cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 [10] , as well as asymptomatic cases of acute pulmonary embolism, suggesting significant vascular effects of currently unknown cause [11] ( Figure 4B ). It can also be noted that our analysis did not predict the broad spectrum antiinflammatory hydroxychloroquine, or the antiviral remdesivir (agents suggested for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia) as significant targets based on this RNAseq analysis of early acute effects of SARS-CoV-2.Kaplan-Meier survival estimates using lung adenocarcinoma datasets finds a significant relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection response genes and patient survivalTo confirm that there are significant disease associations of the SARS-CoV-2 infection response genes, we performed both univariate and multivariate Cox hazard model analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates of lung cancer (LC) adenocarcinoma patient data ( Figure 5 and supplementary table) . SARS-CoV-2 infection response genes are able to stratify LC patients, with differential expression of the responding gene associated with significantly reduced survival ( Figure 5) . Notably, we found that inflammatory and chemokine related genes were particularly associated with poor prognosis in these patients (P < 0.05).This analysis provides insight into the acute inflammatory nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs and provides data that can be used to examine comorbidity interactions with COVID-19 early-stage disease. This would support the notion of giving particular consideration and critical care to patients with co-morbidities, particularly with lung related diseases such as LC; as survival outcomes in these patients are likely to be significantly impacted by COVID-19 disease.Targeted immune profiling of SARS-CoV-2 infected patient blood samples reveals systemic immune responses to infection, and perturbed cell signalling pathways similar to that seen in primary lung cell infection Thus far, we have extensively characterised the acute primary human lung epithelial cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, in order to understand how this may relate to the system-wide immune effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analysed data from a study of the human immune responses in peripheral blood cells of infected individuals. This study used a targeted immune panel on the NanoString platform ( Figure 6 ). Compared to healthy controls, SARS-CoV-2 infected patient samples show a distinct systemic infection response at the RNA level; forming a discrete group by hierarchical clustering ( Figure 6A) . A pooled analysis of all patient time-series data found a total of 45 significant DEGs above an absolute log foldchange of 1 ( Figure 6B) . Notably, compared to our human lung epithelial cell analysis, only three genes (MX1, IRF7, BST2) show concordance between primary lung cell and systemic blood cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the acute phases ( Figure 6C ). Nevertheless, cell signalling pathway analyses find the systemic response is characterised by significant perturbation of 140 matched pathways (Supplementary table) , of which 32 show concordance with those matched in the primary lung cell infection analysis ( Figure 6D ).Collectively, these data suggest that while there is a suite of response genes dysregulated in the acute infection phase, the primary infection in lung cells is characterised by a distinct altered gene set compared with systemic immune response genes. Nevertheless, we see common cellular signalling pathways perturbed in both the primary and systemic acute infection responses at the RNA level, and these are dominated by inflammatory-related cytokine and interferon response pathways.In this study, we have performed phylogenetic viral genome analyses and extensive transcriptomic characterisations of the effects of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, compared with previous human pandemic viruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza A strains H1N2, H3N2, and H5N1. To our knowledge, this is the largest aggregate comparative genomic and transcriptomic study of the novel coronavirus. We have utilised data from primary human lung epithelial cells, as well as peripheral blood cells from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients to compare the primary acute lung cell responses with changes in the systemic immune response. Most notably, despite their close phylogenetic relationships, SARS-CoV-2 induces a distinct transcriptional response in infected lung cells compared with other pandemic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and is also distinct from influenza A strains. We show that inflammatory signalling pathways dominate the acute infection response, and while as expected there was little concordance in the pattern of altered gene expression between infected primary lung cells and circulating COVID-19 patient blood cells, there was concordance seen in a set of perturbed cell signalling pathways. This might be expected if the peripheral blood responses are indirect rather than due to direct blood cell infection, but these observations may prove therapeutically relevant; it suggests that blocking some of these pathways to relieve advanced COVID-19 disease may also reduce some of pathways particularly active in newly infected lung epithelial cells. The pathogenic role of these pathways is not always clear, and while inflammation blockade is desirable for those seriously ill, it may be less so for the early stages of infection. Nevertheless, further analyses using clinical data will be needed to clarify this.As noted above, the human epithelial lung cell transcriptomic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection after 24 h is surprisingly different to that of other viruses. Our analyses shows that of the top 108 genes differentially expressed upon SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and influenza A viral infections, there is little or no concordance in the responses of infected human lung epithelial cells. A notable example is the gene SPRR2E (Small proline-rich protein 2E), which encodes small proteins that form a plasma membrane-associated barrier against extracellular and environmental factors [12, 13] . SPRR2E is upregulated >3fold upon SARS-CoV-2 infection as shown by our analysis, yet is actually downregulated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection, and does not significantly change upon influenza infection at all (Figure 2 ). SPRR2E expression has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis [14, 15] ; a clinical presentation significant in COVID-19 pneumonia [16] and is thus a potentially relevant factor important for further investigation. Additional acute inflammatory responses are also noteworthy. IL8 expression is upregulated >2-fold upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung cells; however, it is not changed at all with SARS-CoV and the influenza strain infections. IL8 is particularly significant, as it is a chemokine involved in acute inflammatory neutrophil infiltrations and tissue damage responses [17] . Understanding mechanisms involved in the distinct SARS-CoV-2 acute response will further our abilities to develop targeted therapeutics for COVID-19 disease. Indeed, others have also used related transcriptomic study approaches to identified lung epitheliumderived factors in COVID-19 but have focussed on (and confirmed) the interaction with other systems such as blood coagulation, a prominent feature of this disease [18] . Beyond the level of expression of individual genes, we sought to investigate ontologies and pathways affected using unbiased database screening approaches. Gene ontology and cell signalling pathway analyses show a clear acute inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung cells, dominated by cytokine and interferon signalling ( Figure 3A and B) . To contextualise this finding with prior published literature on viral infections, we performed an extensive GEO public literature screen of all available viral infection studies ( Figure 4A ). We found that the SARS-CoV-2 infection transcriptional response in lung cells resembles most that seen in published studies of respiratory viral infections SARS-CoV and respiratory syncytial virus, both of which cause respiratory pneumonias in humans. Our predictive drug target analyses screened hundreds of known agents (most with human safety and therapy approvals already) through the Drug Signatures Database screen using DSigDB. Of particular significance, our analysis matched several broad spectrum antiinflammatory drugs ( Figure 5B ). These data are consistent with the notion that cytokine and inflammatory storms are cause of significant morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 disease [19] and that agents aimed at dampening this overactive inflammatory response may prove efficacious. Antimalarial and antiviral drugs have also been examined in COVID-19; notably, Hydroxychloroquine has been subject to much public debate and clinical trials in COVID-19 patients; although its efficacy is unclear [20] . Our analysis did not predict hydroxychloroquine as significant in this case, although this may simply reflect the acute nature of the infection data used in this study rather than the longer term effects of COVID-19.We gained further insight into the pathogenic nature of genes we identified as altered with SARS-CoV-2 infections by conducting survival analyses using LC patient datasets. We performed this study to identify factors that have a particularly strong effect on mortality (and by implication, severe morbidity) in patients with advanced disease that also affects the lung. This work revealed that many of these SARS-CoV-2 response genes, especially inflammatory-related genes, are indeed associated with significantly higher mortality in such patients ( Figure 5 ). This may have important implications for the treatment of COVID-19 patients that also present with co-morbidities, and particularly so for co-morbid lung conditions that may involve the same inflammatory gene and pathway sets. It also accords with the general observations of the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory drugs in reducing disease severity in COVID-19 and in the known role of inflammatory factors in the progression of this disease [21] [22] [23] . This indicates a strategy to identify those patient comorbidities that are at particular risk of having poor COVID-19 outcomes.Thus far our analyses provide novel comparative insight into SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary human lung cells. While our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection represents a model of the acute primary infection responses in the lungs, the nature of the sustained systemic immune responses is also of great therapeutic importance. There are only limited data available on COVID-19 patient peripheral blood analyses, and at the time of writing only two such datasets are publically available [24, 25] . We analysed the unpublished patient data made available in the preprint by Ong et al. [25] and assessed concordant significant genes and pathways between peripheral blood and primary lung cell responses ( Figure 6 ). Our differential gene expression analyses of healthy control and SARS-CoV-2 infected patient peripheral blood cells indicate that the latter cluster separately from healthy controls ( Figure 6A) . A pooled analysis of the systemic immune patient time-course data finds a suit of affected genes; notably, the human leukocyte antigen genes HLA-DQA1 and DQB1 are significantly downregulated 5-7 fold compared to controls ( Figure 6B ). Such a striking downregulation is noteworthy; downregulation of the HLAs in circulating immune cells is also characteristic of HIV [26] and influenza [27, 28] infections, as well as seen in a cancer context [17, 29] . This speaks broadly to the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to induce a response in the antigen-presenting machinery required for CD4/8 T-cell recognition of viral peptides. While it remains unclear if the peripheral blood cells themselves become infected with the virus (this may be true only of monocytes although still remains unknown [30] ), our analysis provides initial insight into the systemic responses in COVID-19 disease that require further validation.Given SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease is associated with local lung inflammation and damage, and a systemic cytokine and inflammatory storm we investigated whether any of the DEGs and associated signalling pathways showed concordance between lung cell and peripheral blood cell datasets ( Figure 6C and D) . We observed little overlap in DEGs; indeed only three genes show concordance (MX1, IRF7 and BST2) ( Figure 6C ). Given the very different nature of the cell types and the infection-reactive nature of the immune responses evident in the blood cells, this is an expected finding. In contrast, however, we see overlap in terms of significant cell signalling pathways matched to the infection datasets ( Figure 6D ); this suggests that although different genes are responding, the same cell signalling pathways involved in the two different tissues. We also note that the peripheral blood cell study employed a targeted NanoString immune panel and not a complete RNAseq transcriptome analysis in this case. It is thus possible that further work using whole transcriptome RNAseq approaches would detect larger sets of concordant genes and pathways in affected individual patient tissues. Nevertheless, this analysis provides the first comprehensive comparison between human coronaviruses, influenza viruses, as well as data on the immune and inflammatory responses in lung and peripheral blood cells at the level of the transcriptome.We performed phylogenetic and RNAseq analyses to compare the viral genome, and infection responses between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and pandemic influenza A strains H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1. We found that SARS-CoV-2 induces a unique transcriptional response in human lung epithelial cells and that this is dominated by inflammatory cytokine and interferon response genes. We provide external validation for these genes and confirmed that although SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a unique transcriptional response, it resembles most closely those of SARS-CoV and respiratory syncytial virus infections in the known literature. COVID-19 patient blood sample analyses also indicate concordance with lung cell infection responses at the level of cell signalling pathway perturbations.These analyses advance our understating of nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the cell and immune responses to it and show how the infection might be examined for other diseases and drug interactions. The pathways we identified can indicate a possible role for already approved drugs, although the latter would only be of utility when if there were further clinical data on these drugs in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is only a very recent discovery, so relatively few studies have been performed on its treatment. Given the global importance of this virus, more datasets will become available, enabling further work to better uncover mechanisms of the unique SARS-CoV-2 infection response in humans.The complete genomes sequences used in this study were collected from the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR; https://viprbrc.org/). To determine the relationship among all these virus strains, we created a comprehensive phylogram that includes the complete genomes of 27 human betacoronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2: MN988668, MN997409, LC522972, NC_045512, MT007544 and MT039890; SARS-COV: AY304495, AY427439, AY461660, FJ882963 and AY559094; MERS-COV: NC_019843.3, KX154694, KY673148, MK039552 and MH371127; H1N1: NC_026435, NC_026436, NC_026432 and NC_026431; H3N2: NC_007371, NC_007366, NC_007370 and NC_007367; and H5N1: NC_007363, NC_007361 and NC_007360. The tree was inferred using the FastME program integrated with a ViPR database using genomic data with 1000 bootstrap replications. Then, Newick formatted phylogram was re-designed with the interactive tree of life online tool (https://itol.embl.de/). Furthermore, the genomic distance and G + C difference were calculated through digital DNA-DNA hybridization using Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator server v2.1 with the default settings. For this analysis, we considered reference genomes of SARS-CoV (Refseq: NC_004718.3) and SARS-CoV-2 (Refseq: NC_045512.2); and formula-2 derived DDH and GC difference scores as per the server's recommendation.We analysed two SARS-CoV-2 related RNAseq transcriptomic datasets. One was an independent biological triplicate of cultured primary human lung epithelial cells that received either infection with SARS-CoV-2 (GSE147507) or a mocktreatment [3] . The second dataset was from a study of immune responses in healthy controls and COVID-19 cases that employed a NanoString Human Immunology Panel to profile collected peripheral blood cells RNA extracted from whole blood samples (E-MTAB-8871). We also analysed data from primary epithelial cells infected with other viruses including SARS-CoV (GSE47963), Mers-CoV (GSE100504) and three different influenza strains (H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1) (GSE89008). The SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV data (and respective controls) were generated from human lung epithelial cells from RNA extracted 24 h post infection. The influenza virus data are human lung epithelial cell transcriptome response to infection with 24 h of H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 influenza virus infection. We used the DESeq2 R Bioconductor package to analyse all these RNASeq transcriptomic data and the LIMMA (linear models for microarray data) normalization R Bioconductor package was used to analyse gene expression data sets. Note that the dataset we employed was generated within a single experimental study, which formed part of the same data batch; for this reason, no batch effect correction was required in the pre-processing of our data. For each dataset, differential gene expression analysis was run between case and control data, with an adjusted P value <0.05 and the absolute value of LFC ≥1 was regarded as threshold criteria to define significant DEGs of interest. We used the Benjamini-Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate and adjust the P values. DEG lists for each viral infection were then ranked on these criteria and between studies comparisons were made.We performed gene set enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology and cell signalling pathways to evaluate the biological relevance and functional pathways of the SARS-CoV-2 associated genes. All functional analyses were performed using the Enrichr (https://a mp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/) software tools [31] . For cell signalling pathway enrichment analyses we employed KEGG [32] , WikiPathways [33] , BioCarta and Reactome [34] databases. We used GO Biological Process (2018) database for gene ontological analysis [35] . For this work an adjusted P value ≤0.05 was considered as statistically significant for enrichment analysis.We collected all available virus perturbations datasets in the NCBI GEO database using Enrichr screening. We identified published virus studies that found similar gene expression effects in host cells that we identified in our SARS-CoV-2 infection analyses.We have used protein-drug interaction data from the DSigDB, DrugMatrix and CMAP databases to identify potential drugs to be proposed in the SARS-CoV-2. For each gene set of our interest from the selected pathways and GO terms, we calculated the frequency (f ) of genes in the study set (s) that interact with a drug, and the frequency (F) of genes in the population set (S) that interact with the same drug. We then performed a test to determine how likely it would be to obtain at least f genes interacting with a drug if s genes would be randomly drawn from the population, given that the frequency F and size S of the population. This can be represented mathematically as follows:To evaluate how LC patient survival is influenced by expression of candidate genes identified as significant in SARS-CoV-2 infections we collected clinical and RNAseq data for LC from the TCGA genome data analysis centre (http://gdac.broadinstitu te.org). The LC clinical dataset (Lung Adenocarcinoma, TCGA, PanCancer Atlas) consists of 566 samples with 81 features, and RNAseq gene expression data included 510 cases [36] . We matched patient ID in both clinical and RNAseq datasets and selected patients with data available for both. Among the clinical variables, we only considered six (ethnicity, anatomical site of cancer, the histological grade of cancer, primary tumour site and neoplasm status with the tumour) to evaluate survival with the significant genes. Hence, we considered z-score values to determine the altered and normal (unaltered) expression of a gene.To determine the patient survival association of the significant genes identified in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we employed a Cox proportional hazards (PH) model for univariate and multivariate analyses; considering the following equitation:h (t |X i ) = h 0 (t) exp β T X i .",Australia,first author,2020-12-18,12
81266dc29a2a8126f0a35f17b76eff8ab41da323,To appear in: Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol,"Early detection of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is key to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 and is particularly challenging in asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients. Commonly reported clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue, pneumonia, and complicated dyspnea 1 . Whilst the most prevalent signs/symptoms in COVID-19 patients (i.e. cough, fever, and fatigue, according to a recent meta-analysis 2 ) have been used as cardinal clinical diagnostic criteria since the beginning of the outbreak, new olfactory and taste disorder(s) were not initially linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection and have not been used for case identification and testing prioritization by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or World Health Organization (WHO) until August 2020. 3 The first systematic assessments of the evidence available up to March 2020 failed to identify associations between anosmia/ageusia and COVID-19 4, 5 . For example, none of the studies included in an early systematic review reported about olfactory or gustative dysfunctions 4 . When looking specifically at the evidence for anosmia in COVID-19 up to 23 March, researchers found it to be ""limited and inconclusive"" 5 . In sharp contrast, the most recent meta-analysis analyzing smell and taste alterations not only reported that approximately half of COVID-19 patients had these symptoms but, also, that 15% of patients had olfactory and gustatory abnormalities as their initial clinical manifestations 6 .In agreement with the growing body of evidence, sudden onset of anosmia, ageusia or dysgeusia have now been recognized as major clinical characteristics of the disease and have been included Here, we aimed to document a case of a patient with taste and smell alterations as the only clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we surveyed current high-level evidence on this topic. She was followed up by telephone surveys and, in the following weeks, did not report any respiratory or other symptoms except anosmia and ageusia. These self-reported alterations began to gradually improve in May and resolved by 25 th May. No VAS testing was possible due to the telephone interviews. As at 29 th August 2020, no new self-reported alterations of taste and smell were reported. After providing thorough information regarding the publication of this case, informed consent was gathered.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a case of COVID-19 with no comorbidities, no medication history and without any symptoms except concomitant loss of smell and taste. A previous study described a patient with anosmia and ageusia as the only indicators of COVID-19 8 , however this patient presented to hospital with the chief complaint of headache, which is now a well-known neurological manifestation of COVID-19 9-12 . Furthermore, this 60-year-old woman had a history of vertigo, seasonal allergies and trigeminal neuralgia. In contrast, our patient had no systemic diseases or allergies. In another report from Norway, a married couple in their sixties reported anosmia (wife) and ageusia (husband), however there was no concurrent alteration of smell and taste 13 . Finally, another peculiarity of our case was the unusually long duration of the symptoms, which lasted for approximately 12 weeks.We found retrospective studies where patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 appear to have suffered from chemosensory dysfunctions in the absence of typical COVID-19 symptomatology 14, 15 . For example, Villareal et al 14 Given the potential usefulness of smell and taste assessment in the diagnosis on asymptomatic patients, we undertook a review of high-level evidence on this topic. The data extracted from published systematic reviews are reported in Table 1 . The range of prevalence of olfactory and gustatory alterations, when reported individually, was 3.2-100% and 0-92.6%, respectively. In the systematic reviews analyzing smell and/or taste together, the range was 5.6-94%. The heterogeneity of these findings may be partially due to differences in the geographical distribution of this association 3 . Interestingly, when the prevalence was pooled on the total number of cases examined, olfactory and gustatory alterations were found in approximately half of COVID-19 patients. In one systematic review 29 , 81.6% (8,823) and 74.8% (8,088) out of 10,818 COVID-19 patients presented with ageusia and anosmia, respectively. Studies 6 also demonstrate that the same signs/symptoms are the initial manifestation in a sizeable number of patients. In light of the data reported here, it is imperative for dentists and oral healthcare providers to recognize ageusia as a potential clinical manifestation of COVID-19.Smell and taste disorders are not rare in the general population and recognize a wide range of causes, including cigarette smoking, nasal and sinus disease, oral or upper respiratory infection, head trauma, neurodegenerative disorders, brain neoplasms, and aging 33 . Medications, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are also associated with chemosensory disfunctions 34 . It is not surprising, therefore, that changes of smell and/or taste were also found to be relatively common in SARS-CoV-2-negative patients 35 . In the case presented here, we ruled out smoking, trauma, medications, infections, and sinus disease based on the information gathered from medical history, clinical assessment and radiographic investigations. The patient could not undertake the neurological assessment prescribed by us due to self-isolation, but given the transitory nature of her alteration and considering the positivity to SARS-CoV-2 testing, it is unlikely that her disturbances were related to brain disease.The possible mechanisms of chemosensory disfunction in COVID-19 are still being elucidated.The high incidence of smell loss without significant rhinorrhea or nasal congestion suggests that SARS-CoV-2 targets the chemical senses through mechanisms distinct from those used by endemic coronaviruses or other common cold-causing agents 36 . It has been proposed that the virus could bind to the olfactory and/or oral epithelium via ACE2 receptor and induce cytolytic damage and inflammatory responses. In turn, this would lead to cellular and genetic changes that could ultimately alter taste and smell 37 . The same mechanism could also directly affect the peripheral neuronal trajectory of the gustatory tract. Another study suggests that the rapid recovery of smell and taste functions in COVID-19 patients could be attributed to a decrease in interleukin-6 levels 38 . While intriguing, these reports are still very speculative and will need to be backed by further experimental and clinical evidence.Smell and taste alterations are not only associated with COVID-19 but can be the first or sole manifestations of the disease. As at 29 August 2020, our patient had not developed any COVIDrelated or other signs or symptoms. Hence, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first COVID-19 patient presenting with prolonged ageusia and anosmia as the sole clinical manifestations of the disease during a 6-month follow-up.

bcc8d21c9bf53ee9096a256489449f92f3f615be,Potent SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralization through maturation of iconic SARS-CoV-1 antibodies,"The emergence of at least three coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS) in the human population in the last two decades has highlighted the need for rapid and sustained development of prophylactic and therapeutic modalities. Among such modalities, antibody reagents blocking the interaction of the viral spike protein with human receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the case of SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in the case of MERS) are among the most promising [1] [2] [3] . Various approaches have been used to identify neutralizing antibodies, including the identification of B-cells from convalescent patients 4, 5 , the immunization of humanized transgenic mice 6 , or through the use of in vitro library display approaches against viral spike protein (or more commonly its receptor binding domain (RBD)) 7,8 .Here we employed a different approach based on the re-engineering and maturation of previously reported antibodies against SARS-CoV-1. Although such antibodies generally do not bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-2, we speculated that the relatively high level of sequence identify of the RBD of the two viruses (76% amino acid identity 9, 10 ) would allow us to shift antibody specificity through limited changes in antibody variable regions.We focused our attention on four well-characterized monoclonal antibodies (m396 11 , CR3022 12 , CR3014 13 and 80R 14 ) which bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-1 with equilibrium binding and IC50 constants in the nanomolar range. Crystal structures have been reported for m396 11 , CR3022 12 and 80R 14 in complex with RBD; these reveal binding to a diverse set of epitopes, with m396 and 80R binding to distinct, but adjacent, epitopes overlapping with the ACE2 binding site (Fig. 1a) . Although no structural information has been reported for CR3014, the antibody has been shown to block ACE2 binding 12 . In marked contrast, CR3022 binds to an epitope distant to the ACE2 binding site which is largely conserved between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 15 . Unlike m396, CR3014 and 80R, CR3022 displays residual binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD; however, it does not detectably neutralize live SARS-CoV-2 virus 15 .For the re-engineering strategy, we focused on two well-established in vitro methods for antibody affinity maturation: (I) site-directed mutagenesis of complementarity determining regions (CDR) of human variable domains 16 and (II) light chain shuffling 17 (Fig. 1B-D) . Library design based on the reported structures of m396, CR3022 and 80R in complex with RBD was used for the construction of site-directed mutagenesis repertoires, with antibody contact residues with antigen targeted for diversification. For the alternative light chain shuffling approach, a previously described highly diverse synthetic antibody library based on a single Vk1 framework was utilized 18, 19 . Both library classes were then selected for binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD using iterative selections on biotinylated antigen (100 nM to 500 pM range). Using these approaches, we rapidly identified human antibody variants with potent affinity and neutralization potential for SARS-CoV-2.For the design of site-directed mutagenesis libraries, we utilized previously reported crystal structures of antibodies developed against SARS-CoV-1 in complex with either cognate RBD (80R -PDB ID 2ghw 20 ; m396 -PDB ID 2dd8 21 ) or SARS-CoV-2 RBD in the case of the cross-specific CR3022 antibody (PDB ID 6w41 15 ). Based on the structures, we selected contact and proximal residues in CDR regions of VH and VL, which were targeted for diversification by Kunkel mutagenesis 16 Table 1 ; all six CDR regions were targeted for CR3014 for which no structural information has been reported). Library construction was carried out in an antibody single-chain Fv (scFv) format, resulting in 6.1 x 10 8 , 2.3 x 10 7 , 3.4 x 10 7 and 5.7 x 10 7 clones for m396, CR3022, CR3014 and 80R respectively. We performed four rounds of phage display selection, using decreasing amounts of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for selection (see Methods); this resulted in enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 specific binders for the libraries (with the exception of CR3014), as indicated by polyclonal phage ELISA ( Fig. 2A) . Screening of individual clones by monoclonal soluble ELISA was performed after round 4, followed by sequencing and cloning of non-redundant variants into an IgG expression vector. After production in CHO cells, monoclonal antibodies were characterized for binding to recombinant RBD by biolayer-interferometry (BLI) and for neutralization of live SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells.In the case of m396, two variants (designated B10 and C4) were chosen for further characterization, with both antibody variants encoding several mutations in VH and VL Table 1 ). Both variants also potently neutralized live SARS-CoV-2 virus with IC50s of 160 ng/ml and 340 ng/ml, respectively ( Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. 1E ). In addition to live virus, m396-B10 also potently neutralized both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticles (with IC50s of 2.2 and 0.3 µg/ml, respectively) ( Supplementary Fig. 1L ).The B10 variant of m396 was further selected for structural characterization by crystallography in a Fab format, both in isolation and in complex with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Crystals were obtained for the unliganded B10 Fab, which diffracted to 2.3 Å (Supplementary Table 2 ). Although no crystals were obtained for the B10 complex, analysis of the structure of the m396 parent bound to SARS-CoV-1 RBD (PDB ID 2dd8 - Supplementary Fig. 2 ) 21 reveals that the bulk of the contact surface is contributed by heavy chain interactions (517 Å 2 buried surface vs 370 Å 2 for the light chain) in which CDR H1 and H2 line one side of a cleft, whilst H3 lines the other side, into which a loop of CoV1 RBD projects (residues 484-492 SARS-CoV-1 numbering, residues 498-506 SARS-CoV-2 numbering). The m396-B10 clone contains several heavy chain CDR mutations relative to the parental m396 antibody: two in H1, four in H2, and two in H3 (Supplementary Information). Although the overall RBD fold is conserved between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 ( Supplementary Fig. 2 , colored in yellow and salmon respectively), the loop bound by the m396 heavy chain cleft comprises a local divergence hotspot containing multiple substitutions: Y498Q, T499P, T501N, I503V (all SARS-CoV-2 numbering), considerably more divergent than the overall RBD. The crystal structure of the m396-B10 Fab described here lacks electron density at most of these CDR positions, indicating conformational plasticity in the unliganded state. In contrast to heavy chain, light chain residues form more limited contacts in the m396 parental complex, with CDR L1 and L3 contacting a surface with considerably greater conservation between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. A total of two mutations were selected in the m396-B10 L3 region (Supplementary Sequences) which contacts the RBD in the parental m396 complex, with no mutations observed in L1 and L2 regions.To further define the epitope of m396 B10, we carried out epitope binning by BLI, which indicated competition with recombinant ACE2 (Supplementary Fig. 3A ). In addition, we generated a triple mutant within the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV-2 RBD (comprising T500A, N501A and Y505A, SARS-CoV-2 numbering), predicted to interfere with parental m396 binding. Mutation of this region in RBD resulted in complete loss of binding of m396-B10 (as well as for m396-C4) (Supplementary Fig.   3B ), suggesting that these variants bind to an epitope within the ACE2 binding site, as previously demonstrated for the parental m396 SARS-CoV-1 RBD interaction 11 .In addition to m396, we selected two variants of CR3022 for further characterization (clones G11 and B11). When expressed in an IgG format both antibodies displayed similar equilibrium binding constants (KD) for SARS-CoV-2 RBD as the parental CR3022 antibody: 94 nM for B11 and 131 nM for G11, respectively, compared to 99 nM for CR3022 (G11: ka 2.4x10 5 M -1 .s -1 , kd 2.2 x 10 -2 s -1 ; B11: ka 1.0x10 5 M -1 .s -1 , kd 1.3 x 10 -2 s -1 ; CR3022 parental: ka 7.2x10 4 M -1 .s -1 , kd 7.1 x 10 -3 s -1 ) (Fig. 2B , Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1A ). However, both the parental CR3022 IgG, as well as the G11 and B11 variants, did not detectably neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virus ( Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. 1E) 15 .In contrast to the m396 and CR3022 phage display selections, no enrichment was observed for the selection of the CR3014 site-directed mutagenesis library ( Fig. 2A) .In the case of the 80R selection, polyclonal ELISA indicated the selection of binders, which could also be detected by soluble ELISA in scFv format ( Supplementary Fig. 4) .Three of the selected clones, designated C9, D1 and D10 were converted into an IgG format, however binding was lost upon antibody format conversion and the clones did not display detectable neutralization activity (Fig. 2B -C and Supplementary Fig. 1E ).In addition to the site-directed mutagenesis approach described as above, we investigated light chain shuffling as a strategy for shifting the specificity of antibodies from SARS-CoV-1 towards SARS-CoV-2 17 . We utilized splice overlap extension PCR 22 to pair DNA encoding variable heavy domains of each of the four antibodies analyzed here (m396, CR3022, CR3014 and 80R) with a kappa light chain library on phage in a scFv format (Fig. 1D) . The synthetic light chain library is based on the human Vk1 framework, with diversity introduced at CDR L1, L2 and L3 position 18 . After ligation and electroporation into E. coli TG1, light chain shuffled libraries of 5 x 10 7 , 1 x 10 8 , 4x 10 7 and 1 x 10 8 clones were obtained for m396, CR3022, CR3014 and 80R, respectively. Three rounds of phage display selection were performed using decreasing amounts of SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen for selection (see Methods); this resulted in enrichment of binders for all of the libraries except m396, as indicated by polyclonal phage ELISA (Fig. 3A ).In the case of the CR3022 selection, binders were dominated by a single clone (designated B6) after three rounds (no additional binders were identified when screening earlier selection rounds). The CR3022-B6 variant was expressed in an IgG format in CHO cells, and further characterized by biolayer-interferometry (BLI) and for neutralization in Vero E6 cells. These analyses revealed that CR3022-B6 IgG bound to soluble recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD with an equilibrium binding constant (KD) of 290 nM, lower than observed for the parental CR3022 antibody (99 nM) ( Fig. 3B and Table 1 ). Intriguingly, and unlike parental CR3022, B6 was capable of neutralizing of live SARS-CoV-2 virus with an IC50 of 4.4 µg/ml (Fig. 3C) . RBD mutagenesis was used to further characterize the CR3022-B6 epitope by targeting the CR3022-RBD interface through a K396S mutation designed to disrupt the interaction (Fig. 4D In the case of the CR3014 selections, libraries became dominated by two clones (D1 and C8) after three rounds of selection. When converted into IgG (and unlike the parental CR3014 IgG, which did not detectably bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD), both clones bound with mid-nanomolar affinity (KD of 51 nM and 61 nM respectively) ( Fig.   3B and Table 1 ). Similar to the observation for the CR3022-B6/CR3022-parental pair, only CR3014-D1 (but not CR3014-C8) was able to detectably neutralize live virus (although weakly with an IC50 >100 µg/ml) (Fig. 3C ).In the case of the 80R selections, later rounds were dominated by a set of variants with closely related CDR sequences. A representative clone (80R-A2) was expressed in an IgG format and analyzed by BLI and neutralization: this revealed that the 80R-A2 variant had acquired the capacity to bind RBD and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with a KD of 61 nM and an IC50 of 17.8 µg/ml ( Fig. 3B -C and Table 1 ). Parental 80R has been shown to block the interaction of SARS-CoV-1 RBD with ACE2 14 . Similarly, 80R-A2 binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD was disrupted through T500A/N501A/Y505A triple substitutions targeting the ACE2 binding site as described above (Fig. 4D surface A and Supplementary Fig. 3B ).In parallel to the affinity maturation of CR3022-B6, we crystallized this variant in a In contrast, no detectable increase of equilibrium binding affinity was observed for variants of CR3022, although two of the analysed variants displayed increased kinetic association constants for SARS-CoV-2 binding compared to the parental CR3022 antibody. However, none of the CR3022 variants generated by site-directed mutagenesis displayed detectable viral neutralization (Fig. 2C ).From the kappa light chain shuffled libraries we identified variants of antibodies CR3022, 80R and CR3014 that bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (no binders were obtained for m396 selections, presumably due to the presence of lambda light chain in the parental antibody). The CR3022 selections were dominated by a single clone, CR3022-B6, which bound SARS-CoV-2 with reduced affinity compared to the parental CR03022 antibody (290 nM compared to 99 nM) ( Fig. 3B and Table 1 ). Intriguingly, and unlike wild-type CR3022, CR3022-B6 effectively neutralized SARS-CoV-2 live virus with an IC50 of 4.4 µg/ml. This apparent discrepancy between affinity and neutralization potential in otherwise closely related variants was further confirmed through epitope mapping. Mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD CR3022 binding site abolished binding of recombinant parental CR3022, but not of CR3022-B6 ( Supplementary Fig. 3B ). In contrast, CR3022-B6 binding was abolished by mutation of the RBD adjacent to the ACE2 binding site (L455A/F456A, Fig. 4D surface B), which did not affect binding of CR3022 wild type ( Supplementary Fig. 3B ). The suggestion that CR3022-B6 binds a different epitope to its parent was confirmed by a crystal structure of CR3022-B6 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 RBD (along with CR3014-C8 in a ternary complex), and through cryo-electron microscopy analysis of CR3022-B6 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike. Both structural analyses confirmed binding of CR3022-B6 in proximity to the RBD ACE2 interaction surface, and distant to the original CR3022 binding site, providing a rationale for its observed neutralization activity.The observation that a human antibody, in its wild-type and matured light chain shuffled form, can bind to two completely different epitopes is intriguing. This observation was not limited to CR3022, with similarly distinct epitopes observed among two variants of the CR3014 antibody (CR3014-C8 and CR3014-D1). Despite the absence of structural information for the parental CR3014 antibody, mutagenesis, crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy clearly highlight the considerable difference in epitope specificity for these two light chains shuffled clones. The difference in specificity also correlates well with neutralization potential: clones binding to a surface proximal to the ACE2 binding site (CR3022-B6 and CR3014-D1) We conclude that in vitro maturation provides a rapid pathway for the identification of potent antibody reagents against emerging viruses.m396, CR3022, CR3014, and 80R scFv were gene synthesized (Genscript) and cloned into the pHEN1 phagemid vector. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by Kunkel mutagenesis 16 . In brief, phagemid vectors were transformed into E. coli CJ236, single colonies grown in 2xYT media supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin, 10 µg/mL chloramphenicol and 2% glucose until reaching an OD600nm of 0.4. Bacteria were then infected with KM13 helper phage and grown overnight at 30°C in 2xYT media supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin, 10 µg/mL chloramphenicol, 50 µg/mL kanamycin and 0.25 µg/mL uridine. Phage particles were purified from the culture media using PEG/NaCl and uridine containing single-stranded DNA (dU-ssDNA) extracted using a QIAprep spin M13 kit (Qiagen). Mutagenesis was carried out by annealing degenerated oligonucleotides to the dU-ssDNA, followed by synthesis of the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) with T7 DNA polymerase and T4 ligase (NEB). Finally, the cccDNA was transformed into electro-competent E. coli TG1 and bacteria titrated to determine library sizes. Bacteria were harvested from the agar plates, grown in 2xYT media supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin, and 2% glucose until reaching an OD600nm of 0.4. At this point, bacteria were infected with KM13 helper phage and grown overnight at 30°C in 2xYT media supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin, and 50 µg/mL kanamycin. Phage antibody libraries were purified from culture media using PEG/NaCl and stored at 4°C.DNA encoding SARS-CoV-1 VH regions was amplified by PCR (using Q5 polymerase NEB). J segments were modified as required to match the following protein sequence (GTLVTVSS). Region encoding V kappa library regions were amplified from a pHEN1 scFv library, comprising the end of the VH J segment, glycine-serine linker and VL regions. The resulting light chain shuffled library was generated by splice-overlapping extension PCR and cloned into pHEN1 in a scFv format using NcoI and NotI restriction sites. DNA was transformed into electro-competent TG1, and phage produced and purified as above.For phage display selection, we biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD using a terminal Affinity maturation was carried out using off-rate selections and streptavidin magnetic beads. Selections were performed essentially as previously described 28 , with the following adjustments: phage were incubated with the biotinylated RBD for 1h, excess unbiotinylated RBD was added (100x and 350x for rounds 2 and 3) and further incubated for 2/8 h for rounds 2/3 before capture on magnetic streptavidin beads. Purified monoclonal antibodies (Fab/IgG) were buffer exchanged into PBS using 3 days at 37°C, 5% CO2. The protein was purified using the His tag as for the RBD purification. The protein was further purified on a Superose 6 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) using an AKTA Pure FPLC instrument (GE Healthcare) to isolate the trimeric protein and remove S2 pre-fusion protein.Serial 2-fold dilutions of test monoclonal antibody were prepared in 96-well plates in octuplicate. The serial dilutions were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C with an equal volume of SARS-CoV-2 isolate containing 200 TCID50 (infectious dose). A Vero E6 suspension containing 2 x 10 4 cells was added to each well, and plates were incubated at 37°C (5% CO2). After 3 days, the plates were observed for cytopathic effect (CPE) and IC50 values were calculated from four parameter dose-response curves (GraphPad Prism). All dilution steps of antibody, virus, and cells were performed in culture media containing MEM, 2% fetal bovine serum, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine.Cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 in growth medium containing high glucose Neutralisation assays were performed in triplicates and outliers were excluded using the modified z-score method. Percentage neutralisation of SARSpp was calculated as (1 -RLUt reatment/RLUno treatment) × 100. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) titre was calculated using non-linear regression model (GraphPad Prism).Gel-filtration chromatography purified SARS-CoV-2 RBD (residues 333-528), and For sample preparation, either spike trimer alone or 1:1 Fab:monomer (molar ratio -for the CR3022-B6 or CR3014-D1 datasets) was incubated at room temperature for 1 h before applying to holey gold grids and freezing. 3.5 µl of each sample was applied to and blob particle picking were performed in cryoSPARC 35 . Extracted particles were subjected to multiple rounds of 2D classification and ab initio reconstruction in cryoSPARC before their locations were exported to Relion 3.0 36 . Motion correction and CTF estimation was then implemented in Relion 3.0 and particles were reextracted and again subjected to 2D classification before 3D auto-refinement and Bayesian polishing.3D classification was then used to sort the particles based on whether density (attributed to Fab) was present above on of the RBDs. The final Fab bound trimer particles were then imported back to cryoSPARC for NU-3D refinement. Supplementary Fig. 6 provides a flowchart to describe this workflow along with FSC curves.

4698757fbebb96669a83bc44b926591774793c7e,"A single dose, BCG-adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 vaccine induces Th1-polarized immunity 1 and high-titre neutralizing antibodies in mice 2 3 4","The search for a COVID-19 vaccine has progressed at unprecedented speed and magnitude. 65Greater than 200 COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in development, with a subset of these now 66 in late-phase clinical trials. The impressive number of candidates suggest extensive diversity 67 in the COVID vaccine pipeline, however most of these vaccines fall into a small group of 68 defined classes, which can be represented by the candidates that have reached human trials. 69The development speed of RNA vaccines has allowed these to move quickly into early trials 70 and results from Phase 3 efficacy results are very encouraging 1 . It will now be critical to 71 determine if these vaccines can induce long-term immunity and be readily distributed to low-72 and middle-income countries, particularly as these vaccines may have complex logistic 73 requirements (e.g. storage at ultra-low temperature). These vaccines also require multiple 74 doses, a barrier to mass vaccination. Viral-vectored vaccines have been shown to impart some 75 level of SARS-CoV-2 specific immunity in humans, although responses were relatively poor 76 in Phase 2 assessment of the Ad5-nCOV vaccine, particularly in older age groups; this was 77 most apparent when examining neutralising antibodies (NAbs) to live virus 2 . While this 78 vaccine class is generally well tolerated, mild to moderate adverse events are observed in a 79 sizable proportion of vaccinees. For example, testing of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine 80 included administration of paracetamol to reduce side effects 3 . Thus, while RNA and viral-81 vectored vaccines will be the first to be licensed and could provide some impact on the 82 pandemic, in the long-term vaccines will need to possess a strong safety profile, invoke 83 sustained protective immunity and be cost effective to produce at scale. 84 85 Vaccine approaches with a proven safety and efficacy track record may provide the best 86 solution for the long-term control of COVID-19. Results from the first clinical trial using one 87 of the more established vaccine approaches, recombinant spike protein in adjuvant (NVX-88 5 CoV2373), were promising; the vaccine generated strong NAbs and specific CD4 + T cell 89 responses in vaccinees 4 . Two versions of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 formulated in alum have 90 been assessed in Phase 2 trials and showed an excellent safety profile 5,6 . This is consistent with 91 the well-established safety and immunogenicity of alum in humans 7 and the success of other 92 inactivated viral vaccines to control major human pathogens. For one of these vaccines 93 (CoronaVac), NAbs titres were relatively low after immunisation, although higher than that 94 needed for the vaccine to protect non-human primates against disease 8 . None-the-less, the 95 protective capacity of CoronaVac-induced immunity will only be determined after large Phase 96 3 vaccine trials are completed. 97 98 One unique strategy is to 'repurpose' existing licensed vaccines for use against Much interest has focussed on Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the 100 tuberculosis (TB) vaccine. A large amount of data has been accumulated to show that BCG has 101 beneficial, non-specific effects on immunity that affords protection against other pathogens, 102 particularly respiratory infections 9 . Most recently, BCG vaccination was shown to protect 103 against viral respiratory tract infections in the elderly (greater than 65 years old) with no 104 significant adverse events 10 . This non-specific protective effect is attributed to the ability of 105 BCG to induce 'trained immunity' i.e. reprogramming of innate immune responses to provide 106 heterologous protection against disease. For these reasons, a Phase 3, randomised controlled 107 trial in healthcare workers has commenced, in order to determine if BCG vaccination can 108 reduce the incidence and severity of COVID-19 (The BRACE Trial) 9 . While the BRACE trial 109 will determine if BCG can reduce the impact on COVID-19 during the current pandemic, BCG 110 does not express SARS-CoV-2 specific antigens and thus would not be expected to induce 111 long-term SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory. The immunostimulatory properties of BCG 13 led to us to test if the vaccine could serve as the 215 backbone of a unique vaccine platform. To examine this, mice were vaccinated s.c with a single 216 dose of BCG Pasteur strain formulated with a stabilized, trimeric form of the SARS-CoV-2 217 spike protein 14 (BCG Spk ) and the titre of IgG2c or IgG1 anti-SpK antibodies (Abs) determined 218 at various timepoints post-immunization (Fig. 1A) . While BCG-vaccination resulted in 219 background levels of anti-SpK Abs, titres were approximately 100-fold higher for both isotypes 220 after BCG Spk vaccination, and similar to Ab levels achieved with SpK formulated in 221Alyhydrogel/alum (Alm SpK ) (Fig. 1B, 1C) . Addition of alum to BCG Spk (BCG:CoVac) further 222 increased Ab titres, particularly IgG2c, which were significantly greater after BCG:CoVac 223 vaccination compared with mice immunised with either BCG or Alm SpK , at all timepoints 224 examined (Fig. 1B, 1C) . Thus BCG could serve to promote early and pronounced anti-SARS-225CoV-2 humoral response when co-delivered with the trimeric SpK antigen, which could be 226 further enhanced with the addition of alum. 227 228 IgG2c Ab isotype correlates with Th1-like immunity in C57BL/6 mice 15 , and such responses 229 are considered necessary for effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection 16 . We 230 therefore examined the frequency of IFN-g-secreting T cells after a single dose BCG:CoVac 231 at 2 weeks post-vaccination. BCG SpK and BCG:CoVac induced the generation of SpK-specific 232 CD4 + and CD8 + T cells secreting IFN-g ( Fig. 2A, 2B) , consistent with Th1 immunity observed 233 after BCG vaccination 17 . The greatest response was observed after vaccination with 234 BCG:CoVac, with the number IFN-g-secreting T cells significantly increased compared to 235 responses of mice vaccinated with either BCG or Alum SpK .The relative paucity of IFN-g-secreting T cells observed after Alum SpK vaccination corresponds 238 with that previously seen with alum-precipitated vaccines using the spike protein 18 Fig 3A) . 257 Surprisingly, NAb titres were at near background levels for mice vaccinated with BCG SpK (Fig.  258   3A) , despite the high levels of IgG Ab isotypes detected in these same animals (Fig. 1 ). 259Encouragingly, high level of NAbs were detected as early as 2 weeks post-immunization upon 260 vaccination of mice with BCG:CoVac, and titres were significantly increased compared to 261 13 vaccination with Alum SpK (approximate 10 fold). The mean NAbs titres in the sera of 262 BCG:CoVac-vaccinated mice were approximately 10-fold greater than that seen in sera from 263 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (Fig 3A) . Although the levels of NAbs peaked at 2 weeks 264 post-vaccination with BCG:CoVac, they remained significantly elevated up to day 42 post-265 immunization compared to the other immunized groups. 266As previous work suggests that IgG antibody levels correlates with NAbs titres after SARS-268CoV-2 infection 27 , we examined if a similar phenomenon was observed after vaccination with 269 BCG:CoVac. Strong corelation (r > 0.9) was observed between IgG2c isotype and NAbs in 270 groups vaccinated with BCG:CoVac or Alum SpK (Fig. 3B) , with a significant yet less robust 271 correlation between IgG1 and NAbs for these groups (Fig. 3C) . There was no correlation 272 between NAbs and either IgG1 or IgG2c Ab for mice vaccinated with BCG SpK alone (Fig. 3D,  273   3E ). These data suggests alum is required for the optimal generation of NAbs after BCG:CoV 274 vaccination; this is a significant advantage for implementation of the vaccine, due to the low 275 cost and long standing safety record of alum 7,28 . Importantly, the potential risk of VAERD due 276 to the selective induction of Th2 by alum is offset by the strong Th1immunity driven by BCG 277 (Fig. 2B) . 278 279COVID-19 subunit vaccines typically display poor immunity after a single dose and require a 281 booster to allow sufficient generation of NAbs 29 . Whilst we observed high-titre NAbs as early 282 as two weeks post-BCG:CoVac vaccination (Fig. 3) , we sought to determine if responses could 283 be further augmented by boosting with a prototype subunit vaccine (Alum SpK ) (Fig. 4A ). At 7 284 days post-boost, IgG2c titres in sera from mice primed with BCG SpK or BCG:CoVac remained 285 elevated by day 42 after the prime (Fig. 4B) . A corresponding augmentation of NAbs was also 286 14 seen in these boosted groups, with significantly elevated response in BCG:CoVac primed mice 287 boosted with Alum SpK (Fig. 4C) . Boosting Alum SpK vaccination with a second dose led to a 288 greater than 10-fold increase in NAbs in boosted mice, however responses were significantly 289 lower than that observed with the superior BCG:CoVac-prime, Alum SpKboost combination 290 (Fig. 4C) . Taken together, these data indicate that the strong antigen-specific immunity 291 where BCG is known to induce some level of protective immunity 13 . In addition, the possibility 302 that prior BCG exposure may impart protection against severe COVID-19 32 , which is currently 303 under evaluation through randomised control studies 9 , raises the possibility that a BCG-based 304 vaccine could afford protection against SARS-CoV-2 escape mutants or new pandemic 305 coronavirus that may emerge. BCG:CoVac could also provide additional benefit in countries 306where BCG is part of immunization programs for the control of TB, based on recent findings 307 that a second BCG vaccination significantly reduced rates of M. tuberculosis infection 33 . 308Overall, the strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity afforded by BCG:CoVac, together with the 309 excellent safety profile of both BCG and alum, supports the progression of BCG:CoVac to 310 human trials.

cebfecb3d5350d355a1a959b09683ea19308c0ba,Analytical validity of nanopore sequencing for rapid SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis,"S evere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative pathogen for COVID-19 disease 1,2 . SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a~30-kb poly-adenylated genome 1, 2 . Complete genome sequences published in January 2020 1,3 enabled development of RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection that have served as the diagnostic standard during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 4 .Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 provides additional data to complement routine diagnostic testing. Viral WGS informs public health responses by defining the phylogenetic structure of disease outbreaks 5 . Integration with epidemiological data identifies transmission networks and can infer the origin of unknown cases [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Largescale, longitudinal surveillance by viral WGS may also provide insights into virus evolution, with important implications for vaccine development [12] [13] [14] [15] .WGS can be performed via PCR amplification or hybridcapture of the reverse-transcribed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, followed by high-throughput sequencing. Short-read sequencing technologies (e.g., Illumina) enable accurate sequence determination and are the current standard for pathogen genomics. However, long-read sequencing devices from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) offer an alternative with several advantages. ONT devices are portable, cheap, require minimal supporting laboratory infrastructure or technical expertise for sample preparation, and can be used to perform rapid sequencing analysis with flexible scalability 16 .The use of ONT devices for viral surveillance has been demonstrated during Ebola, Zika and other disease outbreaks [17] [18] [19] . Although protocols for ONT sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 have been established and applied in both research and public health settings [20] [21] [22] , adoption of the technology has been limited due to concerns around accuracy. ONT devices exhibit lower read-level sequencing accuracy than short-read platforms [23] [24] [25] . This may have a disproportionate impact on SARS-CoV-2 analysis, due to the virus' low mutation rate (8 × 10 −4 substitutions per site per year 26 ), which ensures erroneous (false-positive) or undetected (false-negative) genetic variants have a strong confounding effect.In order to address concerns regarding ONT sequencing accuracy and evaluate its analytical validity for SARS-CoV-2 genomics, we have performed amplicon-based nanopore and short-read WGS on matched SARS-CoV-2-positive patient specimens and synthetic RNA controls, allowing rigorous evaluation of ONT performance characteristics.Analysis of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 controls. Synthetic DNA or RNA reference standards can be used to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of next-generation sequencing assays 27 . We first sequenced synthetic RNA controls that were generated by in vitro transcription of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence. The controls matched the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain at all positions, allowing analytical errors to be unambiguously identified. To mimic a real-world viral WGS experiment, synthetic RNA was reverse-transcribed then amplified using multiplexed PCR of 98 ×~400 bp amplicons that enabled evaluation of~95% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Eight independent replicates were sequenced on ONT PromethION and Illumina MiSeq instruments (see Methods section).We aligned the resulting reads to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome to assess sequencing accuracy and related quality metrics ( Supplementary Fig. 1a-i) . Illumina and ONT platforms exhibited distinct read-level error profiles, with the latter characterised by an elevated rate of both substitution (23-fold) and insertion-deletion (indel) errors (76-fold; Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1d, e) . Per-base error frequency profiles showed clear correlation between ONT replicates (substitution R 2 = 0.67; indel R 2 = 0.82; Supplementary Fig. 1f, g) . This indicates that ONT sequencing errors are not entirely random but are influenced by local sequence context. For example, indel errors were enriched (1.4-fold) at low-complexity sequences within the SARS-CoV-2 genome (i.e., sites with homopolymeric or repetitive content;~1% of the genome; Supplementary Fig. 1d ). Illumina error profiles showed weaker correlation between replicates (substitution R 2 = 0.15; indel R 2 = 0.42), indicating that short-read sequencing errors were less systematic than for ONT libraries ( Supplementary Fig. 1h, i) .Despite their distinct error profiles, both sequencing platforms demonstrated high consensus-level sequencing accuracy across the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We used iVar and Medaka workflows to determine consensus genome sequences for Illumina and ONT libraries, respectively (see Methods section). We detected just two erroneous variant candidates in a single ONT library ( Table 1) . Both of these were single-base insertions occurring at lowcomplexity sites ( Supplementary Fig. 2) , with no erroneous SNVs detected in any replicate (n = 8). All Illumina libraries exhibited perfect accuracy (Table 1) . Therefore, the sequencing artefacts affecting both technologies had minimal impact on the accuracy of consensus-level sequence determination, with indel errors in ONT samples being a possible exception.Analysis of matched patient isolates. To further evaluate the suitability of ONT sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 genomics, we conducted rigorous proficiency testing using bona fide clinical specimens. We performed ONT and Illumina WGS on matched, de-identified SARS-CoV-2-positive cases collected at public hospital laboratories in Eastern & Southern New South Wales and Metropolitan Sydney from March to April 2020 (see Methods section). Selected specimens covered a range of SARS-CoV-2 lineages and viral titres (~10 3 -10 8 copies/μL; Supplementary Data 1). The SARS-CoV-2 genome was enriched by PCR amplification, using a custom set of 14 ×~2.5 kb amplicons that covers 29,783/29,903 bp (99.6%) of the genome, including 100% of annotated protein-coding positions 6 . Pooled amplicons then underwent parallel library preparation and sequencing on an ONT GridION/PromethION and an Illumina MiSeq instrument (see Methods section). Short-read sequencing was performed according to a pathogen genomics accredited diagnostic workflow in a reference NSW Health Pathology laboratory, enabling direct comparison of nanopore sequencing to the established standard for pathogen genomics.In total, we obtained complete (99.6%) genome coverage with both technologies for 157 matched positive cases (Supplementary Data 1). By comparison to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain, Illumina sequencing identified 7.6 consensus single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 0.04 indels, on average, per sample. A further 1.0 SNVs and 0.2 indels per sample were detected at subconsensus read-count frequencies (20-80%), indicative of intraspecimen genetic diversity (see below). Excluding positions with evidence of sub-consensus variation, this provides an overall comparison set of 1201 consensus variants and 4,674,554 positions that match the reference strain in a given sample, against which to assess the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 nanopore sequencing (Supplementary Data 1).We used each of two best-practice bioinformatics pipelines developed by the ARTIC network to identify consensus variants with ONT sequencing data. The alternative pipelines differed primarily in their use of either Medaka or Nanopolish to call variants (see Methods section). In general, ONT variant candidates identified by both pipelines were highly concordant with the Illumina comparison set. Illumina variants were detected with 99.17% sensitivity and 99.58% precision by Nanopolish, compared to 98.33% sensitivity and 99.24% precision by Medaka ( Table 2) . Undetected variants (false-negatives) were more frequent than erroneous candidates (false-positives), occurring in 14/157 (9%) and 9/157 (6%) of Medaka samples, respectively (Supplementary Data 2). Only 1/7 (14%) of consensus indels in the Illumina comparison set was detected by either Nanopolish or Medaka, while a further five and nine false-positive indels were detected by the respective pipelines (Supplementary Data 2). While the scarcity of consensus indels detected with either sequencing technology prevented a more thorough evaluation of indel accuracy, this indicates that ONT is inadequate for accurate detection of small indels in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. In contrast, SNVs were detected by Nanopolish and Medaka with high accuracy: overall, we found 99.66% and 98.83% concordance between ONT and Illumina SNVs, as measured by Jaccard similarity, with identical results in 145/157 (92%) and 153/ 157 samples (97%), respectively ( Table 2) .Inspection of false-positive and false-negative variant candidates detected with ONT sequencing data showed that these tended to occur in low-complexity sequences, which are known to be refractory to ONT base-calling algorithms 23 . For example, falsenegative and/or false-positive candidates were found within a 21-bp T-rich site in the orf1ab gene in multiple samples ( Supplementary  Fig. 3a, b) . We identified 15 problematic low-complexity sites in the SARS-CoV-2 genome ranging in size from 9 to 42 bp in length that . This suggests that the accuracy of nanopore WGS may be improved via the exclusion of a small number of 'blacklist' low-complexity sites in the SARS-CoV-2 genome from downstream analysis. We next assessed the impact of sequencing depth on ONT performance. To do so, we down-sampled nanopore sequencing reads from a uniform 200-fold coverage across the SARS-CoV-2 genome and repeated variant detection across a range of coverage depths (see Methods section). Both sensitivity and precision of variant detection were strongly influenced by sequencing coverage, showing a sharp decline below~50-fold coverage depth, with minimal improvement observed above~60-fold ( Supplementary  Fig. 1a, b) . As above, excluding error-prone low-complexity sequences afforded consistent improvements to sensitivity and overall concordance across the range of depths tested (Fig. 1a, b) .To verify these observations and assess reproducibility, we resequenced 12 specimens, selected to cover a range of SARS-CoV-2 titres (C t = 10 3 -10 7 ), to generate triplicate (n = 3) data on both Illumina and ONT platforms. We measured reproducibility by performing pairwise comparisons of detected variant candidates between replicates for a given sample (Supplementary Data 4) . No discordant variants were detected between Illumina replicates across any of the 36 pairwise sample comparisons (309 variants total), confirming the reliability of short-read WGS. ONT also showed high reproducibility, with 99.36% Jaccard similarity between Medaka replicates for consensus variants (310 total) and perfect concordance for SNVs (Supplementary Data 4).In summary, ONT sequencing enabled highly accurate and reproducible detection of consensus-level SNVs in SARS-CoV-2 patient isolates but appears generally unsuitable for the detection of small indel variants.Detection of intra-specimen variation. Within-host genetic diversity is a common feature of RNA viruses, with divergent quasi-species present in a single infection. Within-host diversity may help infecting viruses evade the host immune response, adapt to changing environments and can cause more severe and/ or long-lasting disease [28] [29] [30] . Resolving this diversity may also better inform studies of virus transmission than consensus-level phylogenetics alone [31] [32] [33] . Therefore, we next evaluated the capacity of nanopore sequencing to identify intra-specimen genetic variation by detecting variants present at sub-consensus frequencies (i.e. variants detected in <80% of mapped reads). Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA controls and replicate short-read sequencing libraries (see above) showed that sequencing artefacts in Illumina libraries could be misinterpreted as variants at read-count frequencies below~20% ( Supplementary  Fig. 2b and Supplementary Data 5), effectively establishing a lower bound for variant detection. We therefore limited our analysis to variants detected at ≥20% frequency, taking variants detected by Illumina sequencing above this level to be genuine. Overall, short-read sequencing identified sub-consensus variants (20-80%) in 54/157 samples, comprising 156 SNVs and 20 indels (Supplementary Data 6) .Using Varscan2, we identified 154 sub-consensus SNV candidates in ONT sequencing libraries (Supplementary Data 6) . We detected 119 SNVs (sensitivity = 76.3%) in the Illumina comparison set and 25 false-positives (precision = 82.6%; Supplementary Data 6). Read-count frequencies for variants identified with both technologies were correlated (R 2 = 0.69), indicating that these were bona fide variants, rather than sequencing artefacts (Fig. 1c) . While the overall performance of sub-consensus SNV detection was quite poor, most false-positives and false-negatives were confined to the lower end of the frequency range assessed here (Fig. 1c, d) . For example, SNVs at high (60-80%) and intermediate (40-60%) sub-consensus frequencies were detected with relatively high sensitivity (95.7%, 91.3%) and precision (100%, 97.7%), whereas low-frequency variants (20-40%) were detected with low sensitivity (63.2%) and precision (69.6%; Fig. 1d ). Unsurprisingly, the high rate of indel errors in ONT sequencing libraries meant that they were unsuitable for detecting indel diversity, with errors overwhelming true variants (Supplementary Data 6) .In summary, ONT sequencing enabled detection of withinspecimen SNVs at frequencies from~40-80% with adequate accuracy but was generally unsuitable for the detection of indels or rare SNVs (<40%).Detection of structural variation. Large genomic deletions or rearrangements can have a major impact on virus function and evolution, however, there are currently just a few reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 specimens harbouring structural variants (SVs) 15, 34 . Therefore, we next evaluated the detection of SVs in SARS-CoV-2 specimens with ONT sequencing. We used NGMLR-Sniffles to identify potential SVs in ONT libraries and validated these with supporting evidence from short-read sequencing (see Methods section).Across all SARS-CoV-2 patient specimens, we detected 16 candidate deletions ranging in size from 15 to 1840 bp (Table 3) , while no other SV types were identified. Of these, 13/16 were supported by split short-read alignments and/or discordant readpairs in matched Illumina libraries ( Supplementary Fig. 4a and Table 3 ). For 7/16 candidates, short-read evidence confirmed the presence of the deletion but indicated that the breakpoint position was not accurately placed by ONT reads (Supplementary Fig. 4b and Table 3 ). Among the thirteen deletions detected by both platforms were examples in genes S, M, N, ORF3, ORF6, ORF8 and orf1ab (Table 3) . Only one variant, a 328-bp deletion in ORF8 ( Supplementary Fig. S4c ), was detected in multiple specimens, although highly similar (but not identical) 28 bp and 29 bp deletions were also detected in S in two unrelated specimens ( Supplementary Fig. 4d) .Overall, this analysis demonstrates that large deletions can be reliably detected using ONT sequencing and suggests that structural variation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome is more common and diverse than currently appreciated.Viral WGS can be used to study the transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, and is increasingly recognised as a critical tool for public health responses to COVID-19. Nanopore sequencing offers an alternative to established short-read platforms for viral WGS with several advantages. ONT devices: (i) are relatively inexpensive, highly portable and require minimal associated laboratory infrastructure; (ii) enable rapid generation of sequencing data and even real-time data analysis; (iii) require comparatively simple procedures for library preparation and; (iv) offer flexibility in sample throughput, accommodating single (e.g., Flongle), multiple (e.g., MinION/GridION) or tens/hundreds (e.g., PromethION) of specimens per flow-cell 16, 18 . Therefore, ONT sequencing could further empower SARS-CoV-2 surveillance initiatives by enabling point-of-care WGS analysis and improved turnaround time for critical cases, particularly in isolated or poorly resourced settings 35 .Due to the relatively low mutation rate observed in SARS-CoV-2 26 , accurate sequence determination is vital to correctly define the phylogenetic structure of disease outbreaks. With ONT sequencing known to exhibit higher read-level sequencing error rates than short-read technologies [23] [24] [25] , reasonable concerns exist about suitability of the technology for SARS-CoV-2 genomics. Moreover, public databases for SARS-CoV-2 data (e.g., GISAID: https://www.gisaid.org/) already contain consensus genome sequences generated via ONT sequencing, potentially confounding investigations that rely on these resources.The present study resolves these concerns, demonstrating accurate consensus-level SARS-CoV-2 sequence determination with ONT data. We report that: (i) variants at consensus-level read-count frequencies (80-100%) were detected with >99% sensitivity and >99% precision across 157 SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens, confirming the suitability of ONT sequencing for standard phylogenetic analyses; (ii) high accuracy and reproducibly was achieved by each of two alternative tools for ONT variant detection, with Nanopolish showing modest improvements over Medaka; (iii) a minimum~60-fold sequencing depth was required to ensure accurate detection of SNVs, but little or no improvement was achieved above this level; (iv) false-positive and false-negative variants were typically observed at low-complexity sequences, with fidelity improved by excluding these problematic sites; (v) in contrast to consensus SNVs, ONT sequencing performed poorly in the detection of consensus indels or low-frequency variants (such variants should therefore be interpreted with caution); (vi) while the high indel error rate in ONT sequencing impedes accurate detection of small indels, long nanopore reads appear well-suited for the detection of large deletions and potentially other structural variants. Although SNVs alone are sufficient for routine phylogenetic analysis, small indels and large structural variants can profoundly impact gene function and are, therefore, of interest to studies of virus evolution and pathogenicity 15 .As the first systematic evaluation of nanopore sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 WGS, this study removes an important barrier to its widespread adoption in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While short-read sequencing platforms remain the gold-standard for high-throughput viral sequencing, the advantages to portability, cost and turnaround-time afforded by nanopore sequencing imply that this emerging technology can serve an important complementary role in local, national and international COVID-19 response strategies.Synthetic RNA controls. Synthetic controls used in this study were manufactured by Twist Biosciences and are commercially available (Catalog item 101024). The controls comprise synthetic RNA generated by in vitro transcription (IVT) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, representing the complete genome in 6 ×~5 kb continuous sequences. The controls used in this study are identical in sequence to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain (MN908947.3), allowing sequencing artefacts to be readily identified. Synthetic controls were prepared for sequencing via a protocol established by the ARTIC network for viral surveillance (https://artic.network/ ncov-2019). Briefly, reverse-transcription was performed on aliquots of synthetic RNA (at 10 6 copies per μL) using Superscript IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with both random hexamers and oligo-dT primers. Prepared cDNA was then amplified using multiplexed PCR with 98 ×~400 bp amplicons tiling the SARS-CoV-2 genome (ARTIC V3 primer set; see Supplementary Data 7). Amplification was performed with Q5 Hotstart DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) with 1.5 μL of cDNA per reaction. PCR products were cleaned using AMPure XP beads (0.8X bead ratio), quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and partitioned into separate aliquots for analysis by short-read and nanopore sequencing. We note that it is not possible to amplify the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome in this way, since amplicons that span boundaries of the 6 ×~5-kb IVT products necessarily fail. Nevertheless, we were able to evaluate~95% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence.SARS-CoV-2 specimens. SARS-CoV-2-positive extracts from 157 cases, tested at NSW Health Pathology East Serology and Virology Division (SaViD), were retrieved from storage and included in this study. Wherever relevant, ethical regulations for work with human participants with informed consent were observed, with oversight by HREC at South Eastern Sydney Local Health District (SESLHD; 2020/ETH00287). All specimens were nasopharyngeal swabs originating from patients in New South Wales during March-April 2020. Specimens underwent total nucleic acid extraction using the Roche MagNA Pure DNA and total NA kit on an automated extraction instrument (MagNA pure 96). Reverse-transcription was performed on viral RNA extracts using Superscript IV VILO Master Mix (Thermo Fisher), which contains both random hexamers and oligo-dT primers. Prepared cDNA was then amplified separately with each of 14 ×~2.5-kb amplicons tiling the SARS-CoV-2 genome, as described elsewhere 6 (see Supplementary Data 7) . Amplification was performed with Platinum SuperFi Green PCR Mastermix (Thermo Fisher) with 1.5 μL of cDNA per reaction. PCR products were cleaned using AMPure XP beads (0.8X bead ratio), quantified using PicoGreen dsDNA Assay (Thermo Fisher). All 14x amplicon products from a given sample were then pooled at equal abundance and partitioned into separate aliquots for analysis by short-read and nanopore sequencing. This strategy ensured that any sequence artefacts potentially introduced during reverse-transcription and/or PCR amplification were common to matched ONT/Illumina samples, so would not be interpreted as false-positive/negatives during technology comparison. Technical replicates were generated by reamplification and sequencing of existing RNA extracts (not by re-extraction).Short-read sequencing. Pooled amplicons were prepped for short-read sequencing using the Illumina DNA Prep Kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were multiplexed using Nextera DNA CD Indexes and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Within each sequencing lane, a blank sample was also prepared and sequenced, in order to monitor for contamination and/or index swapping between samples. The resulting reads were aligned to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (MN908947.3) using bwa mem (0.7.12-r1039) 36 . Primer sequences were trimmed from the termini of read alignments using iVar (1.0) 37 . Trimmed alignments were converted to pileup format using samtools mpileup (v1.9) 38 , with anomalous read pairs retained (--count-orphans), base alignment quality disabled (--no-BAQ) and all bases considered, regardless of PHRED quality (--min-BQ 0). Variants were identified using bcftools call (v1.9) 38 , assuming a ploidy of 1 (--ploidy 1), then filtered for a minimum read depth of 30 and minimum quality of 20. Variants were classified according to their read-count frequencies as consensus (>80% reads supporting the variant) or sub-consensus (20-80%) variants, with the latter further divided into high (60-80%), intermediate (40-60%) or low-frequency (20-40%) . Variants at read-count frequencies below 20% were considered to be potentially spurious and excluded on this basis. Nanopore sequencing. ARTIC amplicons (~400 bp) from the synthetic RNA controls were prepared for nanopore using the ONT Native Barcoding Expansion kit (EXP-NBD104). The longer amplicons (~2.5 kb) used on SARS-CoV-2 patient specimens were prepared for nanopore sequencing using the ONT Rapid Barcoding Kit (SQK-RBK004). Both kits were used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Up to 12 samples were multiplexed on a FLO-FLG001, FLO-MIN106D or FLO-PRO002 or flow-cell and sequenced on a GridION X5 or PromethION P24 device, respectively. In addition, a no-template negative control from the PCR amplification step was prepared in parallel and sequenced on each flow-cell (Supplementary Data 8) . The RAMPART (v1.0.6) software package 39 was used to monitor sequencing performance in real-time, with runs proceeding until a minimum~200-fold coverage was achieved across all amplicons. At this point, the run was terminated and the flow-cell washed using the ONT Flow Cell Wash kit (EXP-WSH003), allowing re-use in subsequent runs.The resulting reads were basecalled using Guppy (4.0.14) and aligned to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (MN908947.3) using minimap2 (2.17-r941) 40 . The ARTIC tool align_trim was used to trim primer sequences from the termini of read Performance evaluation. For synthetic RNA controls, read-level quality metrics, such as sequencing error rates, were derived from read alignments using pysamstats, with any bases that differed from the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence considered errors. The accuracy of variant detection by ONT sequencing was evaluated by comparison to the set of variants identified by Illumina sequencing in matched cases. To ensure consistent representation of variants across calls generated by different programs: (i) multi-allelic variant candidates were separate into individual SNVs/indels using bcftools norm (1.9) 38 ; (ii) multi-nucleotide variants were decomposed into their simplest set of individual components using rtg-tools vcfdecompose (3.10.1) and; (iii) indels at simple repeats were left-aligned using gatk LeftAlignAndTrimVariants (4.0.11.0). Variant candidates identified by Illumina/ ONT could then be considered concordant based on matching genome position, reference base and alternative base/s. For a given case, variant candidates identified with ONT and Illumina were classified as true-positives (TPs), candidates identified by ONT but not Illumina as false-positives (FPs) and candidates identified by Illumina but not ONT as false-negatives (FNs). The following statistical definitions were used to evaluate results:Structural variation. To identify structural variation, nanopore reads were realigned to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (MN908947.3) using the rearrangement-aware aligner NGMLR (v0.2.7) 44 . Sniffles (v1.0.11) 44 was then used to detect candidate variants with a minimum length of 10 bp and ≥20 supporting reads. To validate SVs detected with ONT alignments, split short-read alignments and discordant read-pairs were extracted from matched Illumina libraries using lumpy 45 . Variant candidates were then manually inspected to verify evidence from ONT and short-reads and assess breakpoint position reFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.solution.Reporting summary.

51c93ef8726fb3775c16449dc01d466b27fcc610,A systematic review of the infectious complications of colchicine and the use of colchicine to treat infections,"Colchicine is a drug that has longstanding use to treat gout, Behcet's disease and Familial Mediterranean Fever. New applications in pericarditis, liver disease, vasculitis, cardiovascular disease and dermatology have helped increase interest in colchicine [1] . There are also several clinical trials currently underway exploring the role of colchicine in combating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [2] . Colchicine interrupts microtubule assembly which is required for cellular processes such as maintenance of cell shape, intracellular trafficking, cell signaling, migration and division [3] . Its anti-inflammatory effects are primarily due to inhibiting neutrophil recruitment, chemotaxis, adhesion, mobilization, superoxide production and inflammasome activation [3] . Colchicine has also exhibited anti-viral properties in vitro through interruption of the tubular network required by some viruses for replication [4À6] . Despite the historic usage of colchicine little is known about the risks or benefits colchicine poses clinically in infectious disease. A meta-analysis limited to doubleblinded randomized clinical trials reported that colchicine did not increase the risk of infectious adverse events [7] . However, most of these studies had small cohorts and were not powered to identify statistical differences in uncommon events such as infections. The efficacy of colchicine in managing infectious diseases has not been reviewed systematically to our knowledge. Since the therapeutic landscape for colchicine has been evolving rapidly it is worthwhile to review what is known clinically regarding 1) Participants: Children or adults receiving colchicine for any clinical indication. 2) Intervention: Colchicine alone or in combination at therapeutic doses. 3) Comparison: Placebo, no treatment, standard treatment, alternate treatment. 4) Outcomes: Infection adverse events (number, type and severity) and/or infectious disease progression (survival, complications, microbiology and pathology). 5) Study Design: Clinical trials (randomized, non-randomised, controlled, quasi-experimental), prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control, cross-sectional and case series. The following studies were excluded: pre-clinical, animal studies, editorials, case reports, systematic reviews and meta-analysis.Studies were only included if they reported either infectious adverse events and/or colchicine's effect on infectious disease progression. Infectious diseases were only relevant if there was clear infective etiology reported (e.g. idiopathic pericarditis was excluded but tuberculous pericarditis was included). Studies reporting colchicine overdose or drug-drug interactions were excluded.Search Strategy: Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS and Cochrane Library) were searched from inception to 12 th October 2020. The initial search was performed in PubMed with the following search string: ""(colchicine [ )."" The other databases were searched using analogous keywords and phrases. Only papers in English were included. Bibliographical references from included studies were manually searched and included if relevant. All titles and abstracts were screened by a single reviewer to identify articles fulfilling eligibility criteria. Full-text screening was performed by a single reviewer to identify articles that reported infectious adverse events associated with colchicine usage or the efficacy of colchicine in managing infectious disease. Data was extracted from full-text studies to include publication details (author, year of publication), disease state, study details (intervention, colchicine dosage, length of study, sample size), participant details (age, gender) and relevant outcomes (number and severity of infectious adverse events as well as efficacy of treatment against infectious diseases). A qualitative data synthesis was performed due to the heterogeneity in study design, disease states, interventions and outcomes. The studies were categorised based on whether colchicine was used to treat infectious disease or associated with infectious adverse events.Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Cochrane Library were performed on 12 th October 2020 and identified a total of 9,237 studies after duplicates were removed. After title and abstract searching 9,039 articles were removed leaving 198 papers. A further 162 articles were excluded after full-text screening. An overview of the study selection process and reasons for article exclusions are outlined in Figure 1 . A total of 36 articles were included in this review. There were 21 interventional studies and 15 observational studies. A summary of the key characteristics and major findings of the intervention and observational studies are presented in Table 1 and Table 2 , respectively. The majority of studies were randomized controlled trials (n=21), followed by retrospective cohort studies (n=6), case-series (n=5), case-control (n=2), cross-sectional (n=1) and a survey (n=1). A number of different disease states were studied including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (n=7), viral liver disease (n=6), gout (n=4), Behcet's disease (n=2), osteoarthritis (n=2), condyloma acuminate and verrucae vulgaris (n=2), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n=1), lung resection surgery (n=1), metabolic syndrome (n=1), joint arthroplasty (n=1), erythema nodosum leprosum (n=1), tuberculous pericarditis (n=1), alcoholic liver cirrhosis (n=1), falciparum malaria (n=1), myocardial infarction (n=2), post-myocardial revascularization (n=1), myocarditis (n=1) and mixed disease states (n=1). Clinical trials varied in duration (4 days to 6 years) and sample size (12 to 4745 enrolled patients). The doses of colchicine ranged from 0.5mg to 5.0mg a day with cumulative doses of 12 to 2,628mg. Observational studies ranged from 4 to 386,010 participants and the specific doses of colchicine were often not reported. The studies were categorized and analysed based on those where colchicine was used to treat infectious disease (n=17) and those that reported infectious adverse events (n=19).In the retrospective cohort study by Arrieta et al. [9] patients who received colchicine (1.0mg daily, 5 days a week) were significantly less likely to develop hepatocellular carcinoma at 3 years follow up compared to the non-colchicine group (9% vs 29%, respectively, p <0.05). There was a significant increase in survival in the colchicine group (252 §11 months vs. 218 §21 months, P<0.05). In managing hepatitis C patients, colchicine was compared to ribavirin and interferon-a [10, 11] . Albillos et al. [10] found no significant change in disease related outcomes (hepatitis venous pressure gradients, hepatic vascular resistance, hemoglobin, ALTs or serum HCV-RNA) between ribavirin and colchicine (1.0mg daily, 6 months). Angelico et al. [11] reported that 23% of patients treated with interferon-a alone were HCV-RNA negative compared to only 10% of patients treated with adjunct colchicine (1.0mg daily, 6 days a week, 1.5 years) (P<0.05). Due to the poor outcome the study was terminated prematurely. Hepatitis B infections were managed with colchicine in three studies [12À14] . The study by Floreani et al. [12] found a sustained antibody response in 4 out of 6 colchicine (1.0mg daily, 5 days a week, 6 months) patients compared to 2 of the 6 control patients. Lin et al. [13] reported the cumulative incidence of cirrhosis development in the colchicine (1.0mg daily, 5 days a week, 4 years) group was 32% at 4 years compared to 73.2% in the control group (P=0.057). Episodes of acute exacerbation, defined as an acute rise in ALTs by > 300 U/L was significantly lower in the colchicine group compared to control (32% vs 63% per patient year, P<0.05). Wang et al. [14] found the cumulative survival at 51 months was 75.9% in the colchicine (1.0mg daily, 26 months) group and 75.3% in placebo (P>0.05). Wang et al. [14] reported no significant difference in hepatitis B complications between colchicine or placebo.A total of 5 studies reporting the effectiveness of colchicine in managing COVID-19 were included. A randomized controlled trial by Deftereos et al. [15] evaluated the effectiveness of colchicine (1.0mg daily, 3 weeks) on cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. A total of 105 patients were enrolled and randomized to colchicine (n=55) and control (n=50). The primary clinical endpoint (time to clinical deterioration) occurred in 14.0% of the control group and 1.8% in the colchicine group (OR 0.11, 95% CI, 0.01-0.96, P<0.05). The primary biochemical endpoint (high-sensitivity cardiac troponins and C-reactive protein) was not statistically different between colchicine and control. Event free survival was 18.6 days in the control group and 20.7 days in the colchicine group (P<0.05). A cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients by Scarsi et al. [16] compared colchicine (n=122) to standard of care (n=140). At 21 days follow up there was a lower risk of death in patients treated with colchicine compared to standard of care (HR 0.15, 95% CI, 0.06-0.37, P<0.05). A retrospective observational study by Brunetti et al. [17] compared COVID-19 patients given colchicine (1.2mg daily) to standard of care. The primary endpoint was in-hospital death within 28 days of follow up. Mortality at 28 days was 9.1% in the colchicine group compared to 33.3% in the control (OR 0.20, 95% CI, 0.05-0.80, P<0.05). Patients were also more likely to be discharged by day 28 compared to standard therapy (OR 5.0, 95% CI, 1.25-20.1, P<0.05). A case-series by Delle-Torre et al. [18] reported 9 patients with COVID-19 who were considered at high risk for progression to respiratory failure. Colchicine (1.0mg daily) was started after a median of 8 days from diagnosis and after 72 hrs of colchicine treatment all patients' fevers were abated. A case-series of 5 patients with COVID-19 and iatrogenic allogenesis was reported by Montealegre-Gomez et al. [19] . All 5 cases received colchicine (0.5-1.0mg daily, 1-3 weeks) to manage the symptoms of iatrogenic allogenesis for up to 3 weeks prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Despite all the cases having several co-morbidities and considered at high risk of deterioration, all 5 cases experienced only minor symptoms and did not require hospitalization.A pilot study by Liebenberg et al. [20] aimed to determine the efficacy of colchicine in managing tuberculous pericarditis in South Africa. The study included 33 HIV-positive patients who all received standard TB treatment. The intervention group received colchicine (1.0mg daily, 6 weeks) as an adjunct therapy. There was no significant difference in the development of pericardial restriction between colchicine and control (RR: 1.07, CI 95%, 0.46-2.46, P>0.05).Reba et al. [21] investigated the effectiveness of a colchicine-quinine combination compared to quinine monotherapy in treating P. falciparum in a group of American soldiers while in Vietnam. Colchicine-quinine combination achieved cures in 77% of patients compared to 27% in quinine alone after 45 days of follow up. (continued on next page) The case-series by Gigax et al. [22] reported successful treatment of refractory intraurethral condyloma acuminata in 4 young males with weekly rounds (between 3-11) of intraurethral injections of 10 mL 0.5% colchicine. A case-series by Nelson. [23] explored the effectiveness of using colchicine injections to treat verruca vulgaris in ten patients. Patients received 0.1mL injections of a 1.0mg/mL colchicine solution into each wart once a week. Only 6 out of 18 warts across the patients completely disappeared without recurrence after 3 months.The case series by Gultekin et al. [24] investigated the effect of colchicine in managing five patients diagnosed with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) myocarditis over a 2 year period. Adjuvant low-dose colchicine therapy (1.0mg daily, 2 years) was used in conjunction with traditional heart failure therapy. Initial ejection fractions were 21%, 18%, 25%, 20% and 21% before colchicine therapy. After 2 years ejection fractions were 59%, 45%, 40%, 25% and 41%.A study by Kar et al. [25] trialed treating lepromatous leprosy with colchicine (1.5mg daily, 4 days) compared to aspirin. For mild reactions both colchicine and aspirin were equally effective. For moderate reactions, 64% showed response to colchicine compared to 29% in aspirin group. For severe reactions, neither drug was useful. Colchicine was more effective in controlling neuritis and joint pain symptoms associated with erythema nodosum leprosum compared to control.There were four studies conducted that reported infectious adverse events in gout patients using colchicine [26À29] . A retrospective study by Tsai et al. [26] compared the incidence of pneumonia in gout patients based on colchicine usage. A higher incidence of pneumonia was found for colchicine users (adjusted HR: 1.42, 95% CI, 1.32-1.53). This increased risk was similar across age groups, genders and co-morbidities. Increased cumulative days of colchicine use (> 33 days) and high doses (>24mg) were associated with increased pneumonia risk suggesting a dose response relationship. The retrospective cohort study by Spaetgens et al. [27] found inconsistent infection risk associated with colchicine. There was no significant pneumonia risk in gout patients with current colchicine usage (adjusted HR, 0.88, 95% CI, 0.54-1.44). However, recent exposure (31-91days) and past exposure (>91 days) were associated with pneumonia risk (adjusted HR, 1.60, 95% CI, 1.13-2.27 and adjusted HR, 1.49, 95% CI, 1.32-1.68, respectively). Risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs) was also associated with current and recent colchicine usage (adjusted HR 1.05, 95% CI, 1.24-1.64 and adjusted HR: 1.29, 95% CI, 1.12-1.49, respectively). There was no association with pneumonia related mortality in gout patients stratified by colchicine usage. There was increased risk of UTI related mortality in gout patients who never used colchicine (adjusted HR: 1.25, 95% CI, 1.04-1.49). A randomized control trial by Schlesinger et al. [29] comparing colchicine (0.5mg daily, 16 weeks) to canakinumab for gout prophylaxis reported infectious adverse events in 13 colchicine patients (12.0%) and 58 canakinumab patients (18.0%). No serious infections were reported in the colchicine group but there were 6 serious infections (pneumonia, gangrene, sepsis, tonsillitis, ear infection and erysipelas) in 4 patients on canakinumab. The authors only attributed erysipelas as being related to canakinumab. The authors did not provide analysis regarding whether these differences were of statistical significance. A randomized controlled trial by Yamanaka et al. [28] comparing varying febuxostat doses with a febuxostat/colchicine combination found no significant differences in infectious related adverse events.There were two studies conducted that reported infectious adverse events in patients with Behcet's disease [30, 31] . The crosssectional study by Pata et al. [30] reported that the prevalence of H. pylori, determined by histological diagnosis, was 94% in patients on colchicine but only 44% in patients not on colchicine (P<0.05). The mean duration of colchicine exposure was 3.7 years but doses were not reported. A cross-over trial by Davatchi et al. [31] reported 1 UTI in the colchicine group (1.0mg daily, 4 months) and 1 case of infectious diarrhea in the control group. Statistical analysis was not performed comparing the incidence of infectious events.There were two studies of patients with osteoarthritis who received colchicine [32, 33] . The study by Das et al. [32] found no significant difference in upper respiratory tract infections after 5 months between colchicine (1.0mg daily, 5 months) and control (5% vs 1% of patient visits, respectively, P>0.05). Similarly, Leung et al. [33] reported no significant difference in upper respiratory infections colchicine (1.0mg daily, 16 weeks) and placebo (31.5% vs 18.2%, respectively, P>0.05).A randomized, open-label study by Antoniou et al. [34] reported 8 respiratory infections in patients with idiopathic pulmonary disease treated with IFN-g compared to 2 in the colchicine group (1.0mg daily, 2 years). Pneumonia was responsible for 2 deaths in both the colchicine and INF-g cohorts. Bessissow et al. [35] investigated whether colchicine reduced post-operative atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter after lung resection. Patients received either placebo or colchicine (1.2mg daily, 9 days). After 30 days post-operation, the rate of infections was 12% for colchicine group and 16% for control with no significant difference (adjusted HR, 1.36, 95% CI, 0.38-4.86, P>0.05). One patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome on day 3 due to suspected pneumonia but recovered on day 11.A retrospective, case-control study by Salt et al. [36] examined the infection risk of immunosuppressive medications in patients undergoing large joint arthroplasty. The study found that 11% of cases were prescribed colchicine compared to 9% of controls in the peri-operative period (Chi 2 =7.5, p <0.05). The dose and duration of colchicine was not provided.Demidowich et al. [37] evaluated the efficacy and safety of colchicine for improving metabolic outcomes in people with metabolic syndrome. There was no significant difference in upper respiratory tract infections in the colchicine (1.0mg daily, 4 months) group compared to control (6.5% vs 12.5% patient visits, P>0.05).Morgan et al. [38] investigated the efficacy and safety of colchicine in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Treatment with colchicine (1.2mg daily) lasted between 24 to 72 months. The primary outcome was all cause mortality but secondary outcomes included complications of liver disease. There was no significant difference in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in the colchicine and placebo groups (6.9% vs 9.1%, respectively, P>0.05).A retrospective cohort study by Young-Xu et al. [39] explored the relationship between colchicine use and Clostridium Difficile Infection (CDI). Data was obtained from United States Veterans Affairs system regarding patients who filled a 30-day prescription of colchicine (n=77,202). These were matched to colchicine non-users (n=308,808). Colchicine users were more likely to experience CDI (adjusted RR 1.44, 95% CI, 1.15-1.97). However, patients prescribed < 1.2mg daily of colchicine exhibited a non-significant risk of CDI (adjusted RR 1.21, 95% CI, 0.76-1.94) as opposed to patients prescribed 1.2mg daily (adjusted RR 1.37, 95% CI, 1.09-1.73). This dose response was further supported with significant risk of CDI associated with prescriptions of colchicine for 90 pills or > 60 days. Colchicine use was associated with increased risk of CDI recurrence (adjusted RR 1.23, 95% CI, 1.03-1.49), ICU admission or death (adjusted RR 1.44, 95% CI, 1.02-2.01).A large randomized controlled trial by Nirdoff et al. [40] investigated the effect of colchicine in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary disease. A total of 5,522 patients were randomized to colchicine (n=2,762) and placebo (n=2,760). The median duration of colchicine treatment, 0.5mg daily, was 29 months. Hospitalisation rates for infections were 5.0% in the colchicine group and 5.2% in placebo (HR 0.95, 95% CI, 0.75-1.20, P>0.05). Hospitalisation rates for pneumonia were 1.7% in the colchicine group and 2.0% in placebo (HR 0.84, 95% CI, 0.75-1.20, P > 0.05).Tardif et al. [41] explored the effect of colchicine (0.5mg daily, 19.6 months) in reducing cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction. A total of 4,745 patients were enrolled and assigned to colchicine (n=2,366) or placebo (n=2,379). The median duration of treatment was 19.6 months in colchicine group and 19.5 months in placebo. Infectious adverse events were reported in 2.2% of the colchicine group compared to 1.6% in the placebo with no significant difference (P>0.05). Pneumonia was significantly more likely to occur in the colchicine group compared to placebo (0.9% vs 0.4%, respectively, P<0.05). Septic shock was reported in 0.1% of patients in both colchicine and placebo group.A study by Zarpelon et al. [42] explored whether colchicine (2.0mg daily, 24hrs before surgery and 1.0mg daily after surgery until discharge) was effective in reducing atrial fibrillation in the postoperative period of myocardial revascularization. A total of 140 patients were enrolled and assigned to receive colchicine (n=71) or control (n=69). Patients in colchicine group were more likely to experience post-operative infections compared to control group (26.8% and 8.7%, respectively, P<0.05). Details about the type of post-operative infections were not reported.There were two studies reporting the association between colchicine usage and COVID-19 infection. A case-control study by Gendelman et al. [43] explored the association between COVID-19 and the use of hydroxychloroquine or colchicine. A sample of 14,520 patients was obtained from the Maccabi Health Services database with 1,317 positive cases of COVID-19. The rate of colchicine usage was not statistically different between those who tested positive or negative for COVID-19 (0.53% vs 0.48%, P>0.05). A web survey was conducted by Haslak et al. [44] of 404 children with autoimmune diseases. There were 376 patients on colchicine treatment and only 6 of these patients contracted COVID-19. All cases recovered completely.This review was based on results from interventional and observational studies with significant heterogeneity in disease states, colchicine doses and lengths of intervention. In light of these limitations, conclusions can only tentatively be drawn from the results of this systematic review.There was minimal evidence that colchicine has a role in combating any infectious disease or its complications. In viral liver disease colchicine was primarily used to prevent liver cirrhosis or complications due to its anti-fibrotic effects [3] . Only Albillos et al. [10] and Angelico et al. [11] monitored viral load in response to colchicine treatment and found no significant change and a deleterious effect, respectively. Some viruses require the microtubule network for their replication cycle including viral entry, intracellular transport, virion assembly and exit. Colchicine has been shown to interrupt hepatitis C, flaviviruses and varicella-zoster replication in vitro [4À6] and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication in mice [45] . However, other viruses such as herpes simplex (HSV) do not depend on the cytoskeleton for replication and are potentially unaffected by colchicine [46] . The impact of colchicine on viral load in viral hepatitis remains unknown. Floreani et al. [12] reported an increased antibody response in patients treated with colchicine. However, this was a pilot study with a small sample size and no significant difference between treatment and control could be drawn. There was no conclusive evidence supporting the role of colchicine in preventing complications in viral hepatitis. Arrieta et al. [9] reported a significant protective effect with delayed development of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, HBV and HCV are not believed to play a direct role in hepatocarcinogenesis and this effect was presumed to occur due to colchicine inhibiting the chronic inflammatory process and cellular proliferation exhibited in all liver disease, regardless of etiology. However, this hypothesis is not supported by a meta-analysis which found colchicine has no use in the management of alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis [47] . Although Lin et al. [13] reported a significant reduction in hepatitis B complications, this was defined as an acute change in ALT liver enzymes. There was no correlation to symptoms and the study found no significant difference in overall disease prognosis.Colchicine has been shown previously to be effective as an adjunct to NSAIDs in managing acute idiopathic pericarditis and preventing recurrences [48] . These studies are based on idiopathic pericarditis with no confirmed infective origin and were subsequently excluded in this review. The study by Liebenberg et al. [20] with tuberculosis pericarditis patients found colchicine provided no significant benefit in reducing pericardial constriction. This study was a pilot study, limited to HIV positive patients and the power of the study was insufficient to detect any small differences in outcomes. The effect of colchicine in treating myocarditis is not understood. There is some evidence demonstrated by cardiac MRI that myocarditis, associated with idiopathic pericarditis is responsive to colchicine treatment [49] . The only clinical evidence in viral myocarditis was a small case series by Gultekin et al. [24] which suggested colchicine improved ventricular ejection fraction in EBV/CMV myocarditis. This study did not report on any changes in viral loads. Pre-clinical studies have suggested that colchicine treatment can in fact decrease macrophage infiltration and lead to increased viral load in both the heart and pancreas of coxsackievirus B3 infected mice leading to increased mortality [50] .The majority of evidence for the use of colchicine in managing COVID-19 was from observational studies. The case-series were generally published at the beginning of the pandemic and helped support the hypothesis that colchicine could dampen the systemic inflammatory response observed in patients with severe disease. The retrospective study by Brunetti et al. [17] was able to demonstrate significant differences in mortality and length of stay in hospital. The GRECCO-19 trial was the first published randomized-controlled trial and found colchicine reduced the time to clinical deterioration but there was no difference in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin or Creactive protein levels. It is unclear whether the clinical benefit was due to colchicine disrupting viral replication or its anti-inflammatory action. Studies involving colchicine and COVID-19 are limited by the inconsistency in standard of care in the control groups. Patients were also enrolled at varying time points after diagnosis of COVID-19 and it is unclear at what stage in the disease progression colchicine treatment is most beneficial. More results from clinical trials are needed before any conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of colchicine in managing COVID-19.Reba et al. [21] found benefit in a colchicine-quinine therapy in treating P. falciparum using a large initial dose (5.0mg on 1 st day). Colchicine may potentiate the anti-malarial effects of quinine by inhibiting merozoite invasion into red blood cells [51] . Colchicine itself is not believed to be an ideal drug against malaria since its IC 50 is approximately 1000 times more in P. falciparum than mammalian cell lines creating a high risk of toxicity [52] . There was some benefit in using colchicine to treat moderate erythema nodosum leprosum reactions in lepromatous leprosy. Colchicine was used to manage the immune reaction with no evidence of impacting the causative Mycobacterium leprae infection. There was little evidence for colchicine in treating condyloma acuminate and verruca vulgaris as both studies were small case-series.The second objective of this systematic review was to identify if colchicine resulted in increased risk of infectious adverse events. Only two of the clinical trials reported statistically significant associations of infections with colchicine usage [41, 42] . This result aligned with the meta-analysis by Stewart et al. [7] that found no significant infection risk from pooled double-blinded randomized controlled trials. Many of the colchicine infectious events tended to be relatively uncommon and the clinical trials with small cohorts were not powered to make statistical comparisons. In the observational studies colchicine was associated with increased risks of pneumonia, CDI, UTIs, post-operative infections and H. pylori [26, 27, 30, 36, 39] . The majority of these studies did not report specific colchicine doses, length of usage and infection etiology (ie. bacterial, viral etc.). However, there appeared to be a dose response to pneumonia risk in the study by Tsai et al. [26] suggesting a possible causal relationship. The two largest clinical trials by Tardif et al. [41] and Nirdoff et al. [40] reported conflicting results. The findings by Spaetgens et al. [27] were inconsistent and there was no logical explanation why recent and past exposure conferred pneumonia risk but current colchicine use did not elevate risk. The severity of pneumonia did not appear to be related to colchicine use with these studies finding no differences in septic shock, ICU admissions or death. There appeared to be no significant association between colchicine and risk of COVID-19 infection. There was some evidence suggesting a relationship between colchicine and Clostridium difficile infection. The results by Young-Xu et al. [39] supported a dose response relationship and also found ICU admissions and death were associated with colchicine usage. A significant limitation in this study is that gastrointestinal events are the most common adverse effects associated with colchicine usage. Positive laboratory tests were required for the diagnosis of CDI but the increased prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms due to colchicine may have decreased testing thresholds in the colchicine group. The increased risk of CDI was only accounted for patients on large doses (> 1.2mg daily) of colchicine. This result may not be generalizable to the majority of patients who are on colchicine for gout prophylaxis that requires recommended doses of only 0.6mg-1.2mg daily. The association of H. pylori with colchicine usage [30] was specific to patients with Behcet's disease and therefore the results may not be generalizable to majority of colchicine users. A causative relationship between colchicine and H. pylori infection seems unlikely since the study by Pata et al. [30] included patients from Turkey where the vast majority of the population are infected with H. pylori in their childhood prior to any colchicine exposure. [53] The possible susceptibility of patients to infections of presumed bacterial etiology (pneumonia, UTIs and C.difficile) could be due to multiple reasons. Colchicine selectively accumulates in neutrophils and disrupts neutrophil recruitment, adhesion and mobility. Neutrophils are the primary cells involved in the innate immune response to extracellular bacteria. Colchicine can also lead to bone marrow suppression (particularly neutropenia) from toxic oral doses [54, 55] , IV administration [56] or by concurrent drug interactions. However, at clinical doses, neutropenia has also been reported in some case studies [57] and a case-control study by Todd et al. [58] found higher rates of blood dyscrasias with previous colchicine exposure. Colchicine also disrupts the NADPH oxidase complex system needed in the synthesis of superoxide anions used by neutrophils to kill bacterial pathogens. These combined effects may render the host susceptible to bacterial infections.A significant strength of this study is the broad scope of study designs, disease states, colchicine doses and intervention lengths that were included. This provided a wide perspective of the clinical evidence regarding the associations between colchicine and infectious disease. A limitation to this study is that we only included studies that specifically reported infectious adverse events. Many randomized controlled trials have been performed using colchicine but did not report infectious events in either the colchicine or control groups. As a result, it is unclear whether this represented no infectious events or that the infectious adverse events were simply not documented.This systematic review suggest there is limited scope for the use of colchicine in treating or managing infectious disease. Although colchicine has shown some anti-viral activity in vitro this has not been conclusive demonstrated clinically thus far. There is some inconclusive evidence suggesting colchicine may confer an increased risk of pneumonia and post-operative infections with studies showing conflicting results. There is promising evidence that colchicine may be a safe, effective treatment in managing COVID-19 but more results from clinical trials are needed.",Australia,first author,2020-12-17,12
4b80e36b582e559141117cf61a6888767b69e6dd,A comparison of non-magnetic and magnetic beads for measuring IgG antibodies against Plasmodium vivax antigens in a multiplexed bead-based assay using Luminex technology (Bio-Plex 200 or MAGPIX),"a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111Over the past 5-10 years there has been a rapid advancement of Luminex 1 bead-based technologies to measure antibody responses to multiple proteins simultaneously. These assays have numerous advantages over traditional enzyme-linked immuosorbent assays (ELISA), such as a reduction in sample volume required and reduced laboratory time if choosing multiple targets to assay for, as well as the main advantage of allowing multiplexed detection of antibody responses. This is particularly relevant for the detection of antibodies against complex pathogens that express many hundreds to thousands of proteins, such as the Plasmodium parasites (the causative agent of malaria). Access to standardized control reagents [1] will also allow results from these assays to be reliably compared between different laboratories, which may result in more consistent findings among different studies [2] .Multiplexed bead-based assays use Luminex 1 xMAP 1 technology [3] (https://www. luminexcorp.com/xmap-technology/), which centers on use of beads (microspheres) with different fluorescent colours that can be detected in unique regions on a compatible instrument such as a Luminex 1 200™ (also known as a Bio-Plex 1 200, sold by Bio-Rad), MAGPIX 1 or FLEXMAP 3D 1 (https://www.luminexcorp.com/xmap-instruments/). The beads are internally labeled with different ratios of two fluorophores, one in a red wavelength and the other infrared. The compatible instruments and related software have pre-gated channels that detect the internal fluorophores in discrete regions. Proteins of interest can be coupled to a unique set of beads, facilitating multiplexed detection of antibody responses to multiple proteins. Coupling is the process of attaching a specific protein to the bead, through carboxyl groups on the bead surface (covalent bonding). Several studies have been conducted with a focus on optimizing various steps of the coupling process or assay work-flow, in the context of detection of antibodies against Plasmodium proteins, such as bead coupling [4] , sample pre-dilution [4] , assay temperature [4] , plate washing [4] , operator expertise [4] , incubation times [1] , and bead numbers [5] . Two different types of bead compositions are available for coupling proteins: nonmagnetic and magnetic. Non-magnetic beads can only be run on flow-based instruments such as the Luminex 1 200™/Bio-Plex 1 200 or FLEXMAP 3D 1 , whilst magnetic beads can be run on both flow-based instruments and the MAGPIX 1 . The MAGPIX 1 is based on CCD imaging technology, and offers some advantages over the flow-based systems such as reduced use of reagents such as sheath fluid and the reduced cost of the MAGPIX 1 instrument compared to the Luminex 1 200™/Bio-Plex 1 200 instruments.The primary aim of this study was to perform a series of comparisons of both non-magnetic and magnetic beads and assaying those beads on the Bio-Plex 1 200 or the MAGPIX 1 . A secondary aim was to determine whether this assay is reproducible in an independent laboratory through an external comparison. This study used a panel of 19 different P. vivax proteins and plasma samples from P. vivax-endemic areas to detect P. vivax-specific IgG responses.For all assays described here, a pool of samples from individuals from Papua New Guinea (PNG) with high levels of anti-Plasmodium antibodies was used as a positive control for the standard curve dilution to adjust for plate to plate variation, as previously described [6] . The standard curve was run on every plate. Two sets of plasma samples from malaria-endemic areas were used for comparisons of non-magnetic and magnetic beads, and the different acquisition instruments. These were 80 individuals from a longitudinal observational cohort study in Thailand, conducted in the Kanchanaburi and Ratchaburi provinces in 2013-2014. This cohort has previously been described in detail [7, 8] , and the 80 plasma samples used were collected at the last visit of the cohort. The second set of samples came from a longitudinal observational cohort study in the Solomon Islands, conducted on the island Ngella in 2013-2014. This cohort has previously been described in detail [7, 9] , and 83 plasma samples were used from individuals at the last visit of this cohort.An additional set of plasma samples from a cohort study in PNG was used for external comparison of the assay. Samples were selected from the Mugil II paediatric cohort study. The study enrolled 450 children aged 5-12 years old in 2012 from the Mugil area on the North Coast of Madang province. All children were given antimalarial drugs to eliminate blood-stage Plasmodium spp. and blood samples were collected for parasitological and immunological studies. For the external comparison, a set of 425 samples was used from the baseline timepoint (collected 2 weeks after drug treatment).All samples were collected after approval from local ethics committees, with volunteers/participants providing written informed consent and/or assent (and parents or guardians providing informed consent for children . The HREC at WEHI approved samples for use in Melbourne (#14/02).The carboxylated beads were sourced from Bio-Rad (Bio-Plex 1 COOH Beads, 1ml, 1.25x10 7 beads/ml and Bio-Plex 1 Pro Magnetic COOH Beads, 1ml, 1.25x10 7 bead/ml) and stored at 2-4˚C. Optimisation of coupling procedures for non-magnetic and magnetic beads were done separately, due to the larger size of the magnetic beads generally requiring more protein (see Results). To be able to measure all plasma samples at the same dilution, we optimized all protein amounts by generating a log-linear standard curve with a positive control plasma pool from immune PNG donors (high responders to Plasmodium antigens). The positive control pool was used to generate a standard curve running from a 1/50 dilution to a 1/25,600 dilution (10 point standard curve, 2-fold serial dilution). One set amount of protein was selected that resulted in a log-linear standard curve over this dilution series; the amounts optimized are not saturating but enable one dilution of plasma (1/100) to be run for all samples. As different amounts of protein are coupled for each protein construct, the MFI cannot be directly compared between proteins. A representative standard curve for both non-magnetic and magnetic beads is shown in S1 Fig. Coupling of P. vivax proteins to non-magnetic beads was performed as previously described [7] . Briefly, the optimised antigen concentration (Table 1 ) was coupled to 2.5x10 6 pre-activated microspheres, in 100 mM monobasic sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.0, using 50mg/ml sulfo-NHS and 50 mg/ml of EDC to cross-link the proteins to the beads. The activated beads were washed and stored in PBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.02% Tween-20, 0.05% Na-azide, pH 7.4 at 4˚C until use. For the coupling to magnetic beads, a magnet rack was used for pelleting the beads, instead of the centrifugation step for non-magnetic beads. The coupling is random, not directional, which is optimal when the epitopes within the proteins are unknown. We qualitatively assessed the stability of the coupled beads by visual comparison of the MFI of the standard curve over a nine-month period. A reduction in the MFI or loss of log-linearity were considered markers of instability.Plasmodium vivax recombinant antigens were expressed and purified in three countries: Japan (Takafumi Tsuboi, Ehime University & Matthias Harbers, CellFree Sciences), Australia (Wai-Hong Tham and Julie Healer, Walter & Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research) and France (Chetan Chitnis, Institut Pasteur). Proteins were expressed either in the wheat-germ cell-free expression system (WGCF) or E. coli. See Table 1 for a complete list of proteins and the optimised amount coupled to non-magnetic and magnetic beads.To measure the IgG levels, a multiplexed bead based assay was used, as previously described [7] . Briefly, antigen-specific IgG was detected by incubating 500 beads of each antigen per well with plasma diluted at 1:100, in a final volume of 100μl. Non-magnetic beads were washed using a vacuum manifold, whereas magnetic beads were washed using a magnetic plate washer. After the washings, 100μl of a 1:100 dilution of 0.5mg/ml PE-conjugated Donkey F Gene annotations and protein IDs were sourced from PlasmoDB (release 36, http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/), or GenBank when necessary. All proteins have previously been used and described in our past work [7] .(ab)2 anti-human IgG (JIR 709-116-098) was added. At least 15 beads of each region/antigen were then acquired and analysed on a Bio-Plex 1 200 instrument and/or a MAGPIX 1 instrument as per the manufacturer's instructions. Note that for comparing data between Bio-Plex 1 200 and MAGPIX 1 instruments it is important that the ""high RP1"" target is not selected on the Bio-Plex 1 200, as this option is not available on the MAGPIX 1 . On each plate, a twofold serial dilution from 1/50 to 1/25,600 of a seropositive control plasma pool (generated from PNG adults) was included. Note that for the external comparison both labs used the same PNG control pool to generate the standard curve. Each instrument was maintained as instructed by the manufacturer, with the relevant calibration, validation and/or verification beads run daily or as indicated by the manufacturer. Note that the Bio-Plex 1 calibration beads used were different between the two laboratories for the external comparison.The results were expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of at least 15 beads for each antigen. We have previously determined that data from at least 15 beads is required per antigen for consistent and repeatable results.Antibody measurements were acquired using a Bio-Plex 1 200 Multiplexing Analyzer System from Bio-Rad for all non-magnetic coupled beads (Bio-Plex 1 200System, Bio-Plex 1 highthroughput fluidics system, microplate platform and a computer with the Bio-Plex 1 manager software v.5.0). Washing steps were carried out on a Bio-Rad Aurum vacuum manifold.For all magnetic coupled beads a MAGPIX 1 Multiplexing System from Millipore was used (MAGPIX 1 System and the Xponent software V.4.2). Washing steps were carried out using a magnetic plate washer from BioTek Instruments (BioTek ELx50). A Bio-Rad Sure Beads magnetic rack was used during the coupling process.Plates were incubated on a Ratek Platform shaker (Microtiter/PCR Plate Shaker). A Vortex Sonicator (Branson 2200), a BioSan Vortex V-1 plus and a Table centrifuge (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5424) were also used during the coupling process.The raw MFI results were converted to relative antibody units (RAU) using protein-specific standard curve data (see S1 Fig for examples of standard curves) . A log-log model was used to obtain a more linear relationship, and a five-parameter logistic function was used to obtain an equivalent dilution value compared to the PNG control plasma. We extrapolated one step further beyond the lowest dilution (i.e. from 1/25,600 to 1/51,200), resulting in converted data units ranging from 1.95×10 −5 to 0.02, as previously described [7] . This was performed in R. Pearson's r correlations were performed to determine the strength of correlation and the statistical significance for all comparisons. To enable these parametric correlations, data were logtransformed prior to the analysis to better fit the normal distribution. Pearson r values <0.3 were considered weak, 0.3-0.7 moderate, and >0.7 strong correlations.Total IgG antibody levels against a panel of 19 P. vivax proteins, measured in plasma samples from 163 individuals living in malaria-endemic areas of Thailand and the Solomon Islands, were assayed using either non-magnetic or magnetic beads and run on a Bio-Plex 1 200 instrument. IgG levels to 18 of 19 proteins were moderate-strongly correlated between nonmagnetic and magnetic assays, with Pearson r-values ranging from 0.53-0.98 (all p<0.0001) (Fig 1) , supporting previous findings based on P. falciparum proteins [10] . This is despite different amounts of each protein being coupled to non-magnetic versus magnetic beads ( Table 1 ). The exception was for the protein PVX_003770 (MSP5), with the lowest correlation coefficient at r = 0.27 (p<0.001). A sub-set of the samples that had relatively high antibody levels for PVX_003770 when assayed with non-magnetic beads had relatively low antibody levels when assayed with magnetic beads, likely accounting for the low correlation coefficient observed. Interestingly, the amount of protein coupled for PVX_003770 (for both non-magnetic and magnetic beads) was substantially lower than for the other proteins. Future experiments are planned to determine whether increasing the protein amount for PVX_003770 could result in a higher correlation between the two platforms. For this comparison, all 19 P. vivax antigens were coupled to magnetic beads only, at the optimised antigen concentrations. Total IgG antibody levels were measured in the same set of 163 plasma samples, with the assay run on both a Bio-Plex 1 200 and a MAGPIX 1 instrument. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of this comparison. Here, the Pearson r correlation coefficients indicated a strong correlation between samples run on both instruments (r = 0.985-0.999, p<0.0001, Fig 2) . These results indicate that results obtained on either platform, when antigens are coupled at the same optimised concentrations to magnetic beads, are highly comparable. The strength of the correlations in this comparison is stronger than the previous analysis (which compared non-magnetic versus magnetic beads on the same instrument), presumably because the same sets of coupled beads were run on both instruments. The The final comparison we wanted to conduct was of antigens coupled to non-magnetic beads and assayed on a Bio-Plex 1 200 instrument with antigens coupled to magnetic beads and assayed on a MAGPIX 1 instrument. As non-magnetic beads are cheaper to purchase, users that have only a Bio-Plex 1 200 instrument would potentially favour this configuration (even though the instrument can run both non-magnetic and magnetic beads). Conversely, for users that only have a MAGPIX 1 instrument, they are only able to run magnetic beads as the instrument cannot detect non-magnetic beads. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of this comparison for a non-commercial assay.It was again observed that there was a moderate-strong correlation between results obtained using the non-magnetic beads/Bio-Plex 1 200 and magnetic beads/MAGPIX 1 platforms, with Pearson r correlation coefficients ranging from 0.42-98 (p<0.0001, Fig 3) . These correlation coefficients are similar to those obtained in the first comparison (non-magnetic versus magnetic beads both run on the Bio-Plex 1 200 instrument), and provide further support for our finding that antigens coupled to either type of beads and run on either instrument generally give very comparable total IgG measurements. As we observed in the first comparison, the weakest correlation was again for the protein PVX_003770 (with a moderate r correlation coefficient of 0.42).The results thus far indicate that IgG levels measured using either non-magnetic or magnetic beads and assayed on either a Bio-Plex 1 200 or MAGPIX 1 instrument are highly comparable. A group of 3 staff members, but all at the same Institute (Walter & Eliza Hall Institute, WEHI) using the same instruments, performed these measurements. Therefore an additional comparison was performed: external comparison of the assay at an independent research Institute located overseas (Case Western Reserve University, CWRU). It is important to note that each Institute used their own (commercial) Bio-Plex 1 calibration and validation beads to set-up and maintain their respective instruments, which may contribute to some variation in results between laboratories.A set of 425 plasma samples were aliquoted at CWRU and shared with WEHI. At the same time, a set of 12 P. vivax proteins ( Table 2) were coupled to non-magnetic beads at WEHI and shared with CWRU. During the same week assays were performed to measure total IgG antibodies against these P. vivax antigens in the 425 plasma samples on Bio-Plex 1 200 instruments independently at each Institute (total of 6 plates run at each Institute). After exclusion of plates or samples following quality control checks (positive control-non log-linear standard curve; bead counts < 15), data from 318 samples was directly compared between sites. The drop from 425 to 318 samples was largely due to one plate with failed standard curves that could not be repeated due to sample availability. IgG levels were compared first using raw data (MFI values). The Pearson r correlation coefficients indicated a strong correlation for all proteins with r-values � 0.76 (p<0.0001), with the exception of PVX_094255 (RBP2b) (r = 0.57, p<0.0001) ( Table 3 , scatter plots in S2 Fig). The same correlation analysis was then performed on data converted in R using the standard curves (to account for any plate-plate variation). Strong correlation coefficients were observed for all 12 proteins, including PVX_094255 (r values � 0.72, p<0.0001) ( Table 3 , scatter plots in S3 Fig) . For the majority of proteins, the correlation was stronger after conversion (Table 3) . This is expected given the conversion, based on the standard curve generated with a plasma pool from immune PNG donors that is run on every plate, is used to account for any plate-plate variation and potentially to overcome differences that might be attributed to different machines maintained and set-up with different calibration and validation bead sets.These results indicate that data generated using this multiplexed assay are highly reproducible in a different laboratory setting when the same coupled-beads are used, particularly if both laboratories have access to the same positive control for standardization. Unfortunately, whilst there is a WHO reference reagent for P. falciparum serology studies [11] , there is not yet a similar product available for P. vivax. Importantly, we also assessed the stability of the coupled beads by running the standard curve 10 times over a period of 9 months (intensely for 2 months) (S4 Fig). For most proteins the coupled beads were highly stable (11/16 tested over 9-months), with the MFI dropping for three proteins and increasing for two proteins. This is supported by previous research that has indicated the stability of protein-coupled beads [10] , noting that the stability may vary by antigen [12] .The aim of this study was to determine whether multiplexing assays performed using magnetic beads or non-magnetic beads are highly comparable, independent of the beads and platform used to analyze the assays. We compared here a total of 19 P. vivax proteins that were coupled Proteins were coupled to non-magnetic beads at WEHI and half of each batch of bead-conjugated protein was shipped to CWRU. All proteins have previously been used and described in our past work [7] .https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238010.t002 to both magnetic beads and non-magnetic beads. The protein concentration used for the couplings was individually determined by optimisation for each protein for the chosen bead type (Table 1) . For this, a dilution series from the positive control plasma pool, prepared from immune PNG donors, was used to generate a log-linear standard curve for each protein. The non-magnetic beads are 5.5μm in size, whilst the magnetic beads are 6.5μm in size, likely accounting for the need to couple on average 0.3μg of protein to non-magnetic versus 0.8 μg of protein to magnetic beads (per 1x10 6 beads). One coupling reaction using these amounts of protein is enough to assay > 3000 samples in singlicate, thus the slightly higher amount of protein required for magnetic beads is unlikely to be a limitation to using this format. We did not assess the efficiency of antigen coupling, which could potentially be an important variable impacting the amount of protein required for coupling. We have demonstrated that results are moderately-strongly correlated whether using proteins coupled to magnetic beads or non-magnetic beads and analysed using either a Bio-Plex 1 200 (non-magnetic and magnetic beads) or MAGPIX 1 (magnetic beads only). Our external comparison has also demonstrated that results generated in different laboratories are strongly correlated, if a reference standard curve is included for standardization. Therefore researchers can, in principle, compare data generated with a different type of bead or assayed using a different instrument platform, if the amount of protein coupled is optimised for the correct type of bead. Overall, the choice of assay platform and instrument used is up to the user. However, we do suggest that selecting one bead composition for running experiments is preferred, given the variation in strength of correlation between proteins (Fig 1) . Running magnetic beads on a Bio-Plex 1 200 or a MAGPIX 1 generates data that is so highly correlated they could be considered interchangeable (Fig 2) . An important consideration is that up to 100 different proteins can be assayed simultaneously using non-magnetic beads and a Bio-Plex 1 200 instrument, whereas the maximum is 50 proteins using a MAGPIX 1 . If less than 50 proteins will be used, the MAGPIX 1 instrument is cheaper and enables washing steps to be conducted with magnets, which improves both bead retention [10, 13] and speed of the assay.For future use and development of the assay, we recommended that a reference laboratory provide both protein-coupled beads and a positive control, along with a Standard Operating Procedure for the assay. All protein-coupled beads should be tested for stability and researchers provided with an expiry date for their use, in addition to checking the performance of the standard curve before each use. This should ensure repeatable and comparable measurements are generated between different research groups. A key focus of P. vivax serology efforts should be to develop a standard WHO reference reagent for P. vivax that is available to any research group worldwide.Whilst these results were obtained in the context of P. vivax-specific IgG responses in individuals from malaria-endemic areas, the large panel of proteins used and consistent results obtained for all proteins suggest these results can be applied to guide studies in other fields. Luminex 1 xMAP 1 technology has been used to measure antibody responses against other infectious pathogens, such as HIV and influenza [14, 15] , to a variety of vaccine antigens such as tetanus toxoid [16] , and more recently to SARS-CoV-2 [17] [18] [19] .Supporting information S1 Fig. Representative example of standard curves generated for each P. vivax protein on non-magnetic and magnetic beads. MFI = median fluorescent intensity. S1 -S10 = standard 1 to standard 12 (2 fold serial dilution of positive plasma pool, starting at 1/50 dilution). The data are converted from MFI to relative antibody units (RAU) using a five-parameter logistic function to obtain an equivalent dilution value compared to the PNG control plasma. For example, an MFI of similar value to that of the 1/50 dilution of the standard curve would result in an RAU of around 0.02 (or 1/50). The RAU values therefore range from 1.95×10 −5 (equivalent to 1/51,200 or S11, as the curve is extrapolated one step further) to 0.02. The original coupled beads were tested at every week for 2 months after coupling, then again at 9 months post-coupling. The MFI of the standard curves are presented (S1 = 1/50, then 2-fold serial dilution). New vials of secondary antibodies were opened on 19/02/19, 26/02/19 and 08/03/19. Protein PVX_094255 (WGCF construct) was not tested in this experiment. (TIF)",Australia,first author,2020-12-04,12
16d6b70666cb1cce829aa76a54c7a7d27afd8fcf,REFUTING COVID-19 MISINFORMATION 1 Refuting Spurious COVID-19 Treatment Claims Reduces Demand and Misinformation Sharing,"the media, reducing both demand for the product and the propensity to share related misinformation online.Sharing Misinformation-defined here as any information that is false-represents a threat to societies that value evidence-based practice and policy making (Lazer et al., 2018; . Smear tactics and political fake news have affected voter attitudes (Landon-Murray, Mujkic, & Nussbaum, 2019; Vaccari & Morini, 2014) , vaccine myths have contributed to the re-emergence of measles (Poland, Jacobson, & Ovsyannikova, 2009) , and climate change misinformation continues to pose a barrier to mitigative action (Cook, Ellerton, & Kinkead, 2018) .COVID-19 is another case in point. At a time when demand for high-quality information has been pronounced, online misinformation has proliferated-both as a result of the rapidly-developing nature of the pandemic, where even the best available evidence of today may be invalidated tomorrow, and due to the actions of ill-informed or malicious disinformants. COVID-19 misinformation has included claims that the virus originated as a bioweapon, or that health supplements or even onions could be effective treatments (e.g., Dupuy, 2020) . The spread of such misinformation can fuel hostility towards groups perceived to be responsible for the pandemic (Devakumar, Shannon, Bhopal, & Abubakar, 2020) ; it can also draw people towards remedies that are unproven, ineffective, or even harmful, and prevent uptake of superior interventions (e.g., using a vitamin supplement to prevent viral J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infection while abstaining from social distancing, mask use, or vaccination), at variance with official health advice Van Bavel et al., 2020) . Accordingly, the World Health Organization (WHO) noted that the pandemic has been accompanied by an infodemic, characterized by a deluge of false information amplified by modern communication technologies (Zarocostas, 2020) . Given the scale of the problem, considerable efforts are being undertaken to fact-check common claims (e.g., Therapeutic Goods Administration, 2020; Weule, 2020) . However, it is unclear how successful these efforts will be, and to what extent individuals initially misled by misinformation will adjust their beliefs and behaviours after receiving a refutation.Cognitive psychology research suggests refuting misinformation is no easy task. Even clearly corrected misinformation often continues to influence memory, reasoning, and decision making--the so-called continued influence effect (Chan, Jones, Hall Jamieson, & Albarracín, 2017; Lewandowsky, Ecker, Seifert, Schwarz, & Cook, 2012; Walter & Tukachinsky, 2020) . Post-correction reliance on misinformation can occur despite demonstrable memory for the correction; it can even arise with fictitious or trivial information. This suggests that continued influence is a cognitive effect that does not necessarily depend on individuals' motivation-it can emerge from failures of memory updating or retrieval processes alone (Rich & Zaragoza, 2016; Swire, Ecker, & Lewandowsky, 2017) .Much of the literature on continued influence has focused on how misinformation is best counteracted (Ecker, O'Reilly, Reid, & Chang, 2019; Paynter et al., 2019; Walter & Tukachinsy, 2020) . Based on this research, several best-practice recommendations have been identified. Specifically, refutations should: (a) come from a trustworthy source (Ecker & Antonio, 2020; Guillory & Geraci, 2013) and, if applicable, discredit the disinformant by exposing their hidden agenda (Walter & Tukachinsky, 2020) ; (b) make salient the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f discrepancy between false and factual information, which has been shown to facilitate knowledge revision (Ecker, Hogan, & Lewandowsky, 2017; Kendeou, Butterfuss, Kim, & van Boekel, 2019) ; (c) explain why the misinformation is false, providing factual information to replace the false information in people's mental models (Paynter et al., 2019; Swire et al., 2017) ; and (d) draw attention towards any misleading strategies employed by misinformants (Cook et al., 2018; MacFarlane, Hurlstone, & Ecker, 2018 , 2020a .Regrettably, real-world refutation attempts often do not take into account these recommendations. For example, it is common for scientists and official bodies to adopt a tentative, ""diplomatic"" approach in their communication (MacFarlane et al., 2018 (MacFarlane et al., , 2020a Paynter et al., 2019) . To illustrate, to counter misinformation regarding the use of vitamin C for COVID-19, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) wrote, ""there is no robust scientific evidence to support the usage of [high dose vitamin C] in the management of COVID-19"" (TGA, 2020) . Such a diplomatic approach to refutation may sometimes be called for to express nuance, and this may be of particular concern during a pandemic characterized by much uncertainty (e.g., Chater, 2020) . However, it is important to recognize that tentative refutations leave open the possibility that misleading information may turn out to be true, which can then be exploited by individuals or organizations with ulterior motives (MacFarlane, Hurlstone, & Ecker, 2020b; Oreskes & Conway, 2010) . It is therefore clear that refutations of health misinformation need to be well-designed to both provide an accurate reflection of the best-available evidence and achieve the desired outcome, while also taking into account the cognitive biases that disinformants-such as health fraudsters trying to sell a product-seek to exploit.Arguably the greatest weakness of existing research into the continued influence effect is its near-universal reliance on questionnaire measures of reasoning. This is an issue because some of the most harmful effects of misinformation may be on behaviours. For this J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reason, a more consequential indicator of the success of a particular refutation strategy is consumer behaviour. The need for objective behavioural indicators is particularly acute in the context of COVID-19, where the combination of high anxiety levels and need for effective treatment may foster misinformation-driven demand for remedies that are ineffective and often dangerous, including bleach, methylated spirits, or essential oils (e.g., Spinney, 2020;  note, however, that for ethical reasons we selected a product for the current study that is unproven as a COVID-19 treatment but relatively safe). Given the well-established attitudebehaviour gap (e.g., McEachan, Conner, Taylor, & Lawton, 2011) , it is critical that studies take steps towards investigating how misinformation affects behaviour, and to what extent corrections can undo those effects (Hamby, Ecker, & Brinberg, 2020) .Against this backdrop, and building on previous theoretical work (MacFarlane et al., 2020b), our aim was to investigate the following two questions: (1) How does exposure to COVID-19 misinformation influence people's (hypothetical) willingness to pay for unproven health products, as well as their subsequent propensity to spread misinformation? (2) Are enhanced refutations based on best-practice psychological insights better suited to counteract the behavioural impacts of misinformation, compared to the tentative refutations often used by authorities?To this end, we exposed participants to misinformation 1 suggesting that high-dose vitamin E can reliably prevent and cure COVID-19. Although vitamins are essential for health, there is ample evidence that vitamin supplementation is contra-indicated in individuals with no pre-existing deficiencies (Guallar 2016) , and the present claim that vitamin E will reliably cure COVID-19 is demonstrably false (Shakoor et al., 2021) . The misinformation employed a number of deceptive techniques used by real-life disinformants (MacFarlane et al., 2020b) . We then provided participants with either no refutation, a tentative refutation based on reputable real-world sources, or an enhanced refutation based on best-practice psychological insights (MacFarlane et al., 2020a (MacFarlane et al., , 2020b Paynter et al., 2019; Walter & Tukachinsky, 2020 ). An additional control group received only an article that provided general information about vitamin E. Instead of using the questionnaire approach typical of misinformation debunking studies, we examined participants' willingness to pay for a vitamin E supplement in a hypothetical auction, and their propensity to promote a mock social media message endorsing the use of vitamin E to treat COVID-19. We hypothesized that misinformation exposure would increase willingness to pay and misinformation promotion, and that the enhanced refutation would more effectively reverse this effect than the tentative refutation.The experiment adopted a between-participants design with four conditions (control vs. misinformation vs. tentative refutation vs. enhanced refutation), with two dependent variables: ""willingness-to-pay""-the amount bid on the vitamin E supplement-and ""misinformation-promotion""-a score derived from a participant's engagement with the misleading social media post. Participants' general attitudes towards health supplements and alternative medicines, as well as their concern about the COVID-19 pandemic were used as covariates; additional predictors included frequency of past vitamin E supplement consumption, belief in the effectiveness of routine vitamin E supplementation, and current state of health.A sample of 680 U.S.-based adult participants were recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). To ensure data quality, participants had to meet eligibility criteria of 97% approval rate and a minimum of 5,000 prior tasks completed. An a-priori power J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f analysis suggested a minimum sample size of 309 to detect an effect of f = .16 (based on the contrast between control and ""full-contingency plus"" conditions in MacFarlane et al., 2018) in our primary contrast (misinformation vs. enhanced refutation) with df = 1, α = .05, 1 -β = .80. Total sample size of 680 was calculated by extrapolating this to incorporate four conditions and an estimated 10% exclusion rate. Participants were randomly allocated to one of the four intervention conditions, subject to the constraint of approximately equal cell sizes.Two a-priori (though not formally pre-registered) exclusion criteria were applied to remove careless responders. One participant was excluded for giving non-differentiated answers to every question in a survey block, and another for responding erratically, with overly inconsistent responses between pairs of equivalent questions (i.e., an odd/even threshold of > 2 Likert points apart). Final sample size was thus N = 678 (344 females, 328 males, 3 non-binary, 3 participants of undisclosed gender; age M = 42.81, SD = 12.64).Predictors. Prior beliefs can moderate responses to health messaging (Myers, 2014) .Thus, participants' general attitudes towards health supplements and alternative medicines were assessed using an 18-item questionnaire, following MacFarlane et al. (2018) . Each item consisted of a declarative statement relating to a motivation for consuming alternative health products (e.g., ""Vitamins are natural, and supplements are therefore safe""). Participants were asked to rate how much they agreed with each statement using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). A composite score was calculated for each participant indicating their general attitude to health supplements and alternative medicines (hereafter, ""general-attitude""). To measure response consistency, each item was paired with a reversephrased statement of similar meaning (i.e., 9 pairs of items). The order of items in the scale was randomized. The general-attitude scale was found to have very good internal consistency J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reliability (Cronbach's α = .87). The full scale can be found in the Supplement, which is available at https://osf.io/p89bm/.Participants' concern about the COVID-19 pandemic was measured as a composite score based on participants' responses to four questions (e.g., ""How severe do you think novel coronavirus will be in the U.S. general population as a whole?"" on a 5point Likert scale [1 = very mild; 5 = very severe]), following Ecker, Butler, Cook, Hurlstone, Kurz, & Lewandowsky (2020) . All items are provided in the Supplement. 2Interventions. Dependent on condition, participants were presented with one or two articles (all articles are provided in Supplement). The control condition used a news article emphasizing the importance of a healthy immune system for fighting COVID-19. The article was modelled on two pieces (Collins, 2020; Weule, 2020) from reputable and independent media outlets, The Conversation and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It highlighted the importance of maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise, and good sleep. To provide a background as to why participants were bidding on a vitamin E supplement, the article included a quote from the U.S. National Institute of Health ""Vitamins and Minerals"" website, ""Vitamins and minerals are…essential for health. The lack of a specific micro-nutrient may cause…disease. Vitamin E, for example, acts as an antioxidant and is involved in immune function. It helps to widen blood vessels and keep blood from clotting. In addition, cells use Vitamin E to interact with each other and to carry out many important functions."" The control article was therefore not fully neutral but contained some allusion that vitamin E supplementation might provide some protection from viral infection. The article also noted that whilst some people believe that vitamin supplements are essential, dietitians say that taking supplements is not necessary unless you have a specific nutrient deficiency or dietary need.The article in the misinformation condition additionally contained false claims suggesting vitamin E can protect against COVID-19. These were modelled on misinformation spread via social media during the early stages of the pandemic (Bogle, 2020; RMIT Fact Check, 2020; Weule, 2020) . We invented a fake expert, Dr. Avery Clarke, and used several deceptive techniques employed by real-life fraudsters (MacFarlane et al., 2020b;  see Table 1 for details).In the tentative-refutation condition, the misinformation article was followed by a second article that highlighted the lack of evidence for claims about vitamin E and COVID-19. It was based on a tentative, ""diplomatic"" refutation style commonly used in real-world attempts to debunk claims about ineffective or unproven health products; specifically, it was modelled on an article featuring interviews with a disease expert and a dietitian (Weule, 2020) . We invented a public health expert, Prof. Simon Corner, and outlined his response to Dr. Avery's claims, ""There is no conclusive evidence that vitamin [E] supplements can delay the onset of an infection or treat respiratory infections, such as COVID-19. Furthermore, vitamin and mineral supplements are not recommended for the general population."" The final paragraph noted that there were some exceptions (e.g., people with specific vitamin deficiencies) and recommended people talk to a doctor, pharmacist, or accredited dietitian.In the enhanced-refutation condition, the misinformation article was followed by a refutational article that, instead of simply noting lack of evidence, drew attention to deceptive and misleading techniques used in the misinformation article and explained how those techniques were used to deceive readers. This enhanced refutation was based on psychological insights regarding the effective debunking of misinformation (MacFarlane et al., 2020a (MacFarlane et al., , 2020b Paynter et al., 2019; Walter & Tukachinsky, 2020 ; see Table 2 for details).J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Dependent measures. We included two novel tasks to measure participants' hypothetical willingness to pay for a spurious treatment and their propensity to spread related misinformation.Willingness-to-pay. To assess willingness-to-pay, we used an experimental auction (MacFarlane et al., 2018 ; also see Becker, DeGroot, & Marschak, 1964; Kagel & Levin, 2011; Thrasher, Rousu, Hammond, Navarro, & Corrigan, 2011) . The auction was hypothetical but previous experiments have shown that results obtained using this hypothetical auction format are comparable to those under fully-incentivized conditions (i.e., when bidding using real money for real products; MacFarlane et al., 2020a). The decision to use a hypothetical format was made for both practicality reasons and ethical concerns about selling an unproven COVID-19 treatment during the pandemic. First, participants were asked to imagine they had been given a $5 endowment. They then had an opportunity to place a bid on a bottle of 100 vitamin E capsules. Participants were shown a plain-packaged picture of the product and a generic text (e.g., ""…The supplement is designed to be taken once a day."").It was explained that the auction was different from other auctions in that participants could only bid once, and it was in their best interest to bid the amount they were willing to pay for the product. Participants entered their bid amount b in cents, with b ∈ (0, 500). They knew this amount would be compared against a random number r ∈ (0, 500) drawn from a uniform distribution, and that if b ≥ r, they would win the auction and purchase the product for amount b but keep 500b of their endowment; otherwise they would lose the auction but keep the full hypothetical endowment. There was an initial practice auction to ensure participants understood the procedure. At the end of the auction, they were informed about the outcome, and were shown their bid amount, the random comparison amount, and their ""take-home"" amount. To mitigate hypothetical bias, we employed two established biasreduction techniques, namely ""cheap-talk""-asking participants to behave as they would if J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the auction was real-and consequentiality-reminding participants the results of this study would have implications for significant public health issues.To assess participants' propensity to promote misinformation via social media, we developed a novel measure. Participants were presented with four social media posts, and they were asked to indicate how they would engage with each post using one of three options, namely ""share"", ""like"", or ""flag"". Each option was accompanied by a brief explanation: Participants were told they could ""Share the post publicly, so more people could read it""; ""Like the post, so your contacts see that you agree with it""; or ""Flag the post if you think it is inappropriate (e.g., offensive, inaccurate, misleading, or promoting illegal activity)"". Participants were also told they could choose not to interact with a post, thus enabling ""pass"" as a fourth response option.The posts are shown in Figure 1 . Three posts were on topics generally related to health and/or COVID-19, whereas the fourth contained an endorsement of misinformation, namely that vitamin E can treat COVID-19. Interest centred on responses to this target post, which was always presented last. The general posts were presented first (in random order) as decoys to help manage demand characteristics. To ensure plausibility, two of the decoy posts were real tweets from the Wall Street Journal and the World Health Organization. To avoid a slight confound that only the target post was from an individual doctor, the third decoy post (relating to a tweet from New Scientist) was also from an invented doctor.Ethics approval was granted by the Human Research Ethics Office of the University of Western Australia. The experiment was run using Qualtrics software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). Participants were initially given an ethics-approved information sheet and provided informed consent. They then responded to questions on demographics, vitamin E consumption, the general-attitude scale, and the COVID-19 questions. Participants then read J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the article(s) associated with the condition they were assigned to (i.e., control, misinformation, tentative-refutation, or enhanced-refutation). This was followed by the hypothetical auction and the mock social media engagement task, in which participants bid for a bottle of vitamin E tablets and interacted with a series of posts (response options: share, like, flag, pass). Finally, participants were debriefed; this included a detailed refutation of the misinformation participants had encountered (following the procedure in the enhancedrefutation condition), and participants had to demonstrate their understanding by correctly answering a question regarding the gist of the debriefing. The experiment took approximately 17 minutes; participants were paid US$2.50.On a descriptive level, willingness-to-pay means across control (C), misinformation We conducted an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with a four-level condition factor, willingness-to-pay as the dependent variable, and general attitude towards health supplements (hereafter: general attitude) and COVID-19 concern as covariates. There was a significant main effect of condition, F(3,672) = 5.76, p < .001, ω 2 = .02 (see Figure 2) . There was also a significant effect of general attitude, F(1,672) = 150.45, p < .001, ω 2 = .18, indicating that greater support for supplements was associated with greater willingness-topay. There was no significant effect of COVID-19 concern, F < 1.Tukey post-hoc tests revealed mean willingness-to-pay was greater in the misinformation condition than the tentative-refutation condition (Δ = 43.86, 95% CI 4.73 -82.98, t = 2.89, p = .021, d = 0.28) and the enhanced-refutation condition (Δ = 59.46, t = 3.92, p < .001, d = 0.37) . There were no significant differences between the other conditions (see Table 3 for details). 3In terms of participant proportions across response categories and conditions, 50.0% of participants in the control condition engaged in liking or sharing of the misinformationendorsing social media post. This increased to 59.1% in the misinformation condition (i.e., an 18.1% increase) but dropped to 41.7% and 26.6% in tentative-refutation and enhancedrefutation conditions, respectively (i.e., 29.5% and 54.9% reductions relative to the misinformation condition). See Table 4 for further details.To formally evaluate participants' propensity to promote the misinformation post, we converted the four response options into a single measure (""misinformation-promotion""). We re-coded each response option to reflect the progression towards an increasing propensity to spread misinformation: flag = -1 (actively combatting the spread of misinformation); pass = 0 (not contributing to the spread of misinformation); like = 1 (signalling approval of misinformation and increasing its salience); share = 2 (actively spreading misinformation).An asymptotic Kruskal-Wallis test found that condition significantly influenced misinformation-promotion, H(3) = 54.25, p < .001 (see Figure 3 ). 4To assess the locus of condition differences, post-hoc Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni adjustment were run. Misinformation-promotion was significantly greater for participants in the misinformation condition, Mdn = 1, compared to control, Mdn = 0.5, Ws = 12434, p = .017, r = -.09, the tentative-refutation condition, Mdn = 0, Ws = 17712, p < .001, r = -.15, and the enhanced-refutation condition, Mdn = -1, Ws = 20566, p < .001, r = -.27. Participants in the enhanced-refutation condition showed significantly lower misinformation-promotion than those in the tentative-refutation condition, Ws = 17386, p < .001, r = -.15, and the control condition Ws = 18494, p < .001, r = -.19. There was no significant difference between the control condition and the tentative-refutation condition, Ws = 15473, p = .168, r = -.05.The present study is one of the first to incorporate behavioural measures into the continued influence paradigm. Specifically, we tested whether exposure to misinformation that presented vitamin E as a potent remedy to prevent and cure COVID-19 affected (hypothetical) product demand and misinformation promotion behaviour. To test the efficacy of interventions counteracting the misinformation, we contrasted a tentative refutation based on real-world sources and an enhanced refutation based on best-practice recommendations.We included general attitude towards supplements and COVID-19 concern as covariates.We found that pre-existing attitudes predicted demand and propensity to promote misinformation, whereas we found no effects of COVID-19 concern. Even though this is perhaps surprising, we refrain from drawing strong conclusions based on this null finding; it is of course possible that degree of concern has little influence on the processing of related misinformation and subsequent decisions (similarly, Ecker, Lewandowsky, & Apai, 2010, reported limited impact of emotionality on the continued influence effect).More importantly, with regards to our experimental manipulation, we found that exposure to misinformation significantly increased participants' subsequent propensity to promote a mock social media post endorsing the misinformation. Although willingness to pay J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f was not reliably affected by the misinformation relative to control, this is best explained by the control article's allusion that vitamins provide some protection from viral infection, meaning that the control condition arguably did not provide a fully-neutral comparison baseline. Compared to the misinformation condition, both refutation types substantially reduced willingness-to-pay and misinformation-promotion, which underscores the general utility of refutations beyond the realm of inferential reasoning measures. The enhanced refutation was more effective than the tentative refutation in reducing misinformation promotion, 5 reinforcing the best-practice recommendations used.Our results demonstrate the persuasive appeal of (COVID-19) misinformation and its potential to influence behaviours (Zarocostas, 2020 ; see also Pennycook, McPhetres, Zhang, Lu, & Rand, 2020) . They also demonstrate the value of an evidence-based approach to debunking. This is in line with previous research (Paynter et al., 2019; Swire et al., 2017) but one of the first demonstrations of this kind with behavioural measures (also see Hamby et al., 2020) . This is of particular relevance given (1) the need for studies to take steps towards addressing the attitude-behaviour gap (McEachan et al., 2011) , and (2) previous work questioning the utility of refutations when it comes to behaviours (Swire-Thompson, DeGutis, & Lazer, 2020; Swire-Thompson, Ecker, Lewandowsky, & Berinsky, 2020) .The practical implications are clear. Individuals exposed to refutations are less likely to waste money on spurious products. Also, individuals exposed to misinformation may be more likely to later on spread it to those around them, but this harmful sharing behaviour can be mitigated through refutations. Although sharing decisions may also be affected by factors other than veracity (e.g., inattention, worldview; Mercier; 2020; Pennycook et al., 2020) , the present study suggests that well-designed refutations are an indispensable tool. The fact that our enhanced refutation was more effective at reducing misinformation promotion illustrates the need for debunking practices to be based on insights from psychology (MacFarlane et al., 2020b ). This will be especially critical during crises such as the current infodemic.Nonetheless, limitations must be acknowledged. First, our enhanced refutation included many elements and it is unclear which ones contributed to the enhanced refutation's success. There may also be nuisance factors such as perceived confidence in evidence, memorability, and article length that differentiated tentative and enhanced refutations.Further research should thus include component analyses to aid the construction of specific best-practice guidelines (see also Lewandowsky et al., 2020; Paynter et al., 2019) . This would also help add theoretical nuance beyond the scope of the current study, furthering understanding of why certain interventions work better than others.Second, we relied only on a hypothetical auction and a mock social media scenario to assess behaviours. Although an important first step, willingness-to-pay methods may display substantial heterogeneity despite bias-reduction techniques (e.g., Kanya, Sanghera, Lewin, & Fox-Rushby, 2019; Voelckner, 2006) , and the same may apply to our social media scenario.It is therefore critical that future studies use measures that correspond with behaviours of interest even more closely (e.g., incentivized auctions, social-media simulations) and validate results using real-world data (e.g., Mosleh, Pennycook, & Rand, 2020) .Third, we did not find a difference in willingness-to-pay between the enhanced and tentative refutation conditions, suggesting that the auction measure may not have been sufficiently sensitive. Potentially related to this, we also did not find a reliable willingness-topay difference between misinformation and control conditions. However, consistent with effects of implied and subtle misinformation (e.g., Ecker, Lewandowsky, Chang, & Pillai, 2014; Powell, Keil, Brenner, Lim, & Markman, 2018; Rich & Zaragoza, 2016) , this may have also been driven by the insinuation in the control article that vitamins can provide some J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infection protection. This suggests that the framing of ""neutral"" educational communications by impartial media sources needs to be carefully considered. The fact that the control condition was non-neutral means there was no neutral no-misinformation baseline; this makes it impossible to conclude with certainty whether there was continued influence (i.e., above-baseline reliance on refuted misinformation) in either of the refutation conditions. Furthermore, there was no time lag between misinformation and correction, nor between interventions and behavioural tasks. This may constrain applicability of current findings for real-world scenarios; future research should explore the impact of longer time delays (see Paynter et al., 2019) .Finally, we recommend that communicators dealing with misinformation consider additional strategies beyond refutations. The speed of misinformation generation and spread presents a challenge to fact-checkers and their capacity to refute misleading content (Lazer et al., 2018) . Future work should thus examine inoculation strategies, which pre-emptively explain misleading techniques common to misinformation campaigns and thus increase resilience to misdirection (e.g., Comptom, 2013; Maertens, Roozenbeek, Basol, & van der Linden; van der Linden, Leiserowitz, Rosenthal, & Maibach, 2017) . In particular, more research is needed to assess the impact of inoculations on behaviours.Both the data and a Supplement containing the materials and supplementary analyses are available at https://osf.io/p89bm/.Author Contributions: All authors jointly developed the study concept and contributed to the study design.

NSW Drug and Alcohol Clinical Research and Improvement Network","Globally, individuals in treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) are facing unprecedented challenges during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Individuals with OUD are at an elevated risk of vulnerability to COVID-19, due to co-occurring health comorbidities, mental health sequelae arising from isolation and socioeconomic instability, (Volkow, 2020) , as well the need to regularly attend treatment programs for supervised dosing in close proximity to other patients and staff.Pre-COVID-19, existing Australian treatment paradigms for opioid agonist treatment (methadone, buprenorphine) required most patients to attend dosing points-large centralized clinics, or community pharmacies-on a daily basis during the early phases of treatment, with gradual increases in access to unsupervised doses over months to years, contingent on risk assessment and mitigation strategies (Gowing, Ali, Dunlop, Farrell, & Lintzeris, 2014) . Most jurisdictions' guidelines recommended up to 4 or 5 take-away doses (TADs) of methadone or sublingual buprenorphinenaloxone per week, and while monthly unsupervised doses of buprenorphine-naloxone have been available, few patients across Australia have been able to access this option.Because methadone and buprenorphine are essential medicines (World Health Organization, 2019), several international bodies issued new guidance and policy directives to facilitate access and ensure continuity of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) during COVID-19. In Australia, professional and consumer groups developed consensus guidance (Nicholas Lintzeris, Hayes, & Arunogiri, 2020) to address some of the specific challenges that face individuals on MOUD. Recommendations included increased access to TADs, strategies for dosing patients in self-isolation, patient surrogates and/or next-of-kin for medication pick-up or supervision, and increased use of telemedicine approaches. The transition to a large number of TADs in response to COVID19 has been a significant divergence from ""routine care"" in Australia.Another response to COVID-19 has been the uptake of long-acting depot buprenorphine treatment options (Alexander, Stoller, Haffajee, & Saloner, 2020; Dunlop, Lokuge, et al., 2020; Nicholas Lintzeris et al., 2020; Samuels et al., 2020) . This commentary aims to provide a perspective on depot buprenorphine in the context of COVID-19, logistical considerations and challenges, and potential implications for future service provision following the pandemic.Two formulations of depot buprenorphine are available in Australia-Buvidal® (Therapeutic Goods Administration, 2020a) and Sublocade® (Therapeutic Goods Administration, 2020b). Both preparations are subcutaneous injections, with the former available for weekly or monthly dosing, and the latter for monthly (see Table 1 ). These formulations have only recently been introduced to the market in Australia, with Buvidal® receiving regulatory approval and government subsidy of medication costs (Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) since September 2019, while J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Sublocade® received regulatory approval in early 2020; however, it received government subsidy only as of May 1, 2020. Sublocade ® is available for MOUD in the U.S. and Canada; Buvidal®/ Brixadi® is available in a number of countries in Europe, and will potentially be available in the U.S. as of late 2020.The potential for infrequent attendance with depot buprenorphine is clearly attractive in the context of the challenges that COVID-19 poses. Patients do not need to leave home frequently, travel (often using public transport), queue within health services (pharmacies, clinics) that may be crowded and carry the risk of exposure from other patients and staff (Dunlop, Lokuge, et al., 2020) ; and all these reduce the risk of exposure for staff working in these services. Depot formulations also mitigate risks related to nonmedical use of methadone or buprenorphine provided as TADs, including overdose deaths, which is particularly relevant for high-risk patients for whom a large number of TADs may not be appropriate. Finally, treatment with depot buprenorphine is generally not associated with any out-of-pocket expenses for patients, whereas dosing at community pharmacies is usually associated with a patient fee of approximately $AUD40 per week (insurance schemes do not subsidize).Yet delivering depot treatment during COVID-19 has posed new challenges, such as the need for procedures to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission when administering depot SC injections, and how to respond to patients in depot treatment who are in quarantine or self-isolation (Lintzeris, Hayes, Arunogiri 2020). Another challenge has been responding to patients in methadone treatment who have requested transfer to depot buprenorphine injections, a process that remains poorly documented or evaluated. An important aspect of patient-centerd care is patient consent, and while there may be advantages in depot treatment in response to COVID-19, it has been important to ensure that service providers work collaboratively with patients in choosing treatment options, recognizing that not all patients will choose this medication approach.Clinical trials that developed pre-registration expertise (Dunlop, Roberts, & Lintzeris, 2020; Frost et al., 2019; Nicholas Lintzeris, Dunlop, & Haber, 2020; Lofwall et al., 2018; Walsh et al., 2017 ; Larance, Byrne, Lintzeris et al 2020), clinical guidance (Nicholas Lintzeris, Dunlop, & Masters, 2019), training programs for service providers, and patient literature from consumer groups (NSW Users and AIDS Association, 2019) have been important in providing strategies to enhance the uptake of this treatment approach. Nevertheless, the uptake of depot buprenorphine treatment prior to March 2020 had been largely concentrated in a number of clinical services that had been involved in clinical trials, or a handful of ""early adopter"" individual private practitioners.It is not possible yet to accurately describe the uptake of depot buprenorphine in response to COVID-19 across Australia. Nevertheless, data are available from some sectors. In New South Wales, government-sector services (traditionally accounting for approximately 40% of opioid treatment, with 60% in private sector) have seen an increase in the use of depot buprenorphine treatment in many, but not all, clinical services (Fig 1) . As at May 2020, data from these 10 local health districts (accounting for 592 patients) showed 40 (7%) patients prescribed Sublocade® and 552 (93%) prescribed Buvidal®. The data suggest that service providers experienced in using depot buprenorphine expanded their use of depot treatment at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak (e.g., those with prior participation in clinical trials); it is these program that account for the majority of all buprenorphine treatment. In contrast service providers with minimal experience with depot buprenorphine did not substantially expand their use of this medication approach. It appears the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic was not a time to ""learn new tricks"". The impact of COVID-19 in Australia has been relatively limited, with few COVID-19 infections and related deaths, by international standards. Addiction treatment services are now focusing on the development of sustainable ""exit"" strategies. Within this context, providers are reflecting on how to retain aspects of service changes that have proven beneficial to patients and staff.We cannot predict the role that depot buprenorphine will play within the OUD treatment armamentarium post-COVID-19 restrictions. COVID-19 interrupted many of the usual translational activities (e.g., consumer and workforce development), and renewed efforts will be required to ensure widespread access to this new treatment. Uptake is likely to improve with widespread implementation of low-risk procedures to minimize risk associated with SC injections (e.g., personal protective equipment [PPE] for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases; routine screening for symptoms, contacts, temperature; and clinicians and patients wearing masks). Workforce training and sharing of clinical practice will also contribute to increased clinician familiarity, capacity, and confidence over time. One key factor that will impact the uptake of depot treatment will be the extent to which treatment services revert to the predominately pre-COVID-19 supervised model of treatment for methadone and sublingual buprenorphine. If this occurs, it will likely propel more patients toward the convenience of depot treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about circumstances that have catalyzed the uptake of longer acting treatments and demonstrated the potential utility of depot buprenorphine from both patients' and providers' perspectives.

As a result, the development of nucleic acid-based tests using different molecular approaches has been rapid. SARS-CoV-2 is currently identified using real-time reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR 4 , isothermal methodologies 5,6 or CRISPR 7, 8 . Isothermal approaches typically require more development and optimisation but have the advantage of speed and are more readily implemented into point-of-care systems 9 . PCR based assays have the advantage of simplicity of design, easier multiplexing potential and in most cases, greater sensitivity. Typical commercial tests use a one tube combined RT and amplification protocol, are carried out in fairly large volumes and use slow protocols with real time data acquisition that result in typical assay times of 1-1.5 h. They are broadly comparable, although their reported sensitivity of 500 viral copies per reaction 10 is significantly lower than generally achievable using this technology, and assays differ significantly in the speed of their overall workflow 9 . Although a more recent publication describes a streamlined assay with a detection limit of 15 copies, this is based on experiments performed by spiking total human RNA with in vitro synthesised viral transcripts, and the total workflow time remains at 2 h 11 . Most SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assays target two viral genes, and positive results are most commonly obtained through the hydrolysis of dual-labelled probes 12 . Targeting more than one viral gene is advisable as there are reports of significant false negative rates for SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR testing 13, 14 . A potential challenge for any nucleic-acid based testing methods is the potential of the virus to mutate and an analysis of primer binding sites targeted by RT-qPCR assays has indeed shown that a high percentage are mutated 15 . A mutation in a reverse primer has been shown to affect the sensitivity of an RT-qPCR assay in use early in the pandemic 10 and further mutations could lead to the occurrence of false negative results, particularly if the mutation occurs at the extreme 3′ end of the primers. Since false negative Primers and probes. Human SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) and SARS-CoV-1 (NC_004718.3) reference sequences and a Bat SARS-like coronavirus genome (MG772933) were downloaded to the Allele ID 7 qPCR assay design software package and SARS-CoV-2 specific primers and probes were designed with manual adjustments aimed at maximising the analytical sensitivity and robustness of the assay. Three SARS-CoV-2 targets, Nsp10, N-gene and Nsp12, were chosen to accommodate sequence variabilities in primer or probe locations and minimise the likelihood of a 3′-mutation at primer binding sites reducing the reliability of the assay. JUN was chosen as a human extraction control to verify that human nucleic acid was present in the sample; it is intronless, thus permitting detection of DNA and RNA, has low tissue-specificity and is highly expressed in proximal digestive tract (https ://www.prote inatl as.org/ENSG0 00001 77606 -JUN/tissu e). The specificity of primers, probes and amplicons was analysed in silico using Primer-BLAST (https ://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools /prime r-blast /) and BLAST (https ://blast .ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast .cgi).In addition, the human SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) genomic sequence was imported to the Beacon Designer 8.2 qPCR assay design software package and an LNA-based genotyping assay for discriminating the D614G mutation (A to G) was designed. Finally, two extraction and inhibition control artificial sequences (EICAS1 and 2) were designed so that they contained no matching sequences in published databases. EICAS1 is amplified using a bespoke primer set, whereas EICAS 2 was designed with terminal 5′ and 3′ sequences amplified by the JUN primers, to avoid potential primer interference during the multiplex PCR. EICAS1 and EICAS2 are detected by the same probe.Upon receipt, all DNA oligonucleotides were resuspended in sterile RNase-free water at 100 µM and stored in aliquots at − 20 °C. The RNA oligonucleotides were diluted to 1 × 10 -9 relative to the original stock with sterile RNase-free water and stored at − 80 °C.RT, qPCR and digital PCR. RNA extracted from clinical samples at a dedicated COVID-19 testing facility at the Broomfield Hospital Microbiology laboratory was tested for SARS-CoV-2 using Viasure's single tube RT-qPCR protocol. RNA (5 µL neat sample) was tested in a final reaction volume of 20 µL, with a 15 min/45 °C RT step, 2-min polymerase activation step and 45 cycles of 10 s/95 °C denaturation and 50 s/60 °C annealing and polymerisation step using Biomolecular Systems' Mic qPCR cyclers with manual threshold setting. Clinical laboratory testing protocols regarded samples as positive for SARS-CoV-2 if a Cq < 38 was recorded either for both ORF1ab and N gene targets or ORF1ab alone. The newly designed SARS-CoV-2 test described in this report, termed CoV2-ID, was validated on the 23 clinical samples (batches A-D) samples using a modified single tube RT-qPCR protocol (PrimeScript III, Takara and 1Step Go, PCRBio) with 1 µL RNA in a final reaction volume of 5 µL, a 5 min/50 °C RT step, 1 min polymerase activation and 40 cycles of 1 s/95 °C denaturation and 1 s/60 °C annealing and polymerisation. Absence of contamination was determined by running no template (NTC) and no RT (NRC) controls.Subsequent one-step combined RT and qPCR reactions were carried out with 0.5 µL RNA, of sample-dependent, varying and unknown concentration, per 5 µL reaction. Where two tube reactions were carried out, 1 µL Scientific Reports | (2020) 10:22214 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79233-x www.nature.com/scientificreports/ RNA was reverse transcribed in 10 µL with Superscript IV Vilo using random primers; EICAS cDNA synthesis was supplemented with specific reverse primer (R) at 10 nM final concentration. RT conditions were 5 min at 25 °C, 5 min at 50 °C and 5 min at 95 °C and cDNA was diluted into 20 µL of water, with 1-5 µL used for further analysis.Primer optimisation was carried out using PrimeScript III by comparing Cqs using combinations of forward and reverse primers at 0.3, 0.6 and 1 µM and choosing the concentrations that recorded the lowest Cq. Probe optimisation was carried out by comparing Cqs obtained using 0.4 µM or 0.8 µM final probe concentration. Optimal annealing temperatures were determined by using SARS-CoV-2 cDNA and the temperature gradient option available on the BioRad CFX followed by melt curve analysis, together with SensiFast SYBR Green mix and optimal primer concentrations. Ideal annealing temperatures were identified as those resulting in the lowest Cq whilst retaining a single melt curve peak.Minimum qPCR run times were established by preparing a single master mix, sufficient to carry out all experiments. The master mix consisted of SensiFast qPCR Probe mix, SARS-CoV-2 cDNA, and primers and probes specific for the targets and was kept on ice until required. 5 µL aliquots were subjected to qPCR for decreasing denaturation and polymerisation times, with 1 s for each step being the minimum possible on the qPCR instruments used.The experiments aimed at reducing RT times were initially carried out as using PCRBio OneStep RT-qPCR reagent, as the RT is supplied separately from the buffer. A 1× master mix of SARS-CoV-2 sample and EICAS RNA, CoV2-ID assay oligo blend (targeting Nsp10, N-gene, JUN and EICAS2) and RT-qPCR buffer was prepared and kept on ice. Immediately prior to each run, 10 µL of that master mix was placed in a microfuge tube, 1 µL of PCRBio RT was added and 2 × 5 µL were added to two wells of a 48 well qPCR plate. The plate was briefly spun and subjected to different RT times, with qPCR times kept constant. All experiments were repeated using PrimeScript III, but since this reagent is a single tube mixture of buffer and RT, a premix of RNAs, CoV2-ID and water was prepared, and 2× PrimeScript III mix was added just prior to each run.RT-qPCR reactions were carried out on the following instruments: CFX (BioRad), Eco (PCRBio), Prime Pro (Techne) or Mic (BMS). Data were analysed using instrument software, Microsoft Excel for Mac v. 16 .38 and PRISM for Mac v.9.Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) reactions were set up as instructed in the operating guide using the QX200 droplet generator (BioRad), clear well semi-skirted 96 well plates, pierceable foil and PX1 PCR plate sealer (BioRad). Each reaction contained concentrations of cDNA corresponding to the ones used in parallel qPCR experiments, with the optimal primer and probe concentrations established for qPCR runs, which are slightly different from the recommended ones for primers (0.9 µM) and probe (0.25 µM). Following droplet generation, PCR reactions were carried out in 40 µL volumes on a C1000 Touch Thermal cycler (BioRad) using the standard program of 10 min enzyme activation at 95 °C, and 40 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94 °C and 1 min annealing/ polymerisation at 60 °C, with the ramp rate set to 2 °C/s. The droplets were analysed immediately on the QX200 reader. RT-ddPCR reactions added a 1 h reverse transcription at 45 °C at the start of the PCR protocol. Data were analysed using QuantaSoft Analysis Pro and QX Manager software.Multiple cycle fluorescence detection PCR. Multiple cycle fluorescence detection PCR assays were carried out using SensiFast in 5 µL volumes using the protocol shown in Table 1 on the CFX Connect instrument (BioRad). The first plate read after cycle 8 was used to establish a baseline fluorescence, thus allowing the calculation of fluorescence increases after cycles 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35. In each case the relative fluorescence change (∆F) was calculated by subtracting the cycle 8 fluorescence reading from the fluorescence readings after the respective cycles.Assay design and characteristics. In silico analysis by PrimerBlast and BLAST analyses of primers, probes and amplicons signified that all virus oligonucleotide sequences were specific for SARS-CoV-2 and that the assays were not complementary to any other coronavirus. Since the oligonucleotide manufacturer enclosed a cautionary note with primer and probe shipments indicating that they ""could contain trace amounts of long oligo templates"" specifying SARS-CoV-2 sequences, all panels were immediately assessed in qPCR assays without addition of template. None resulted in amplification signals, demonstrating that they were not contaminated with either SARS-CoV-2 or JUN templates. Assay details, oligonucleotide sequences, fluorophores, final optimised annealing temperatures (Ta) conditions and PCR efficiencies are shown in Table 2 .The supplementary data file contains the detailed optimisation results for primer and probe concentrations ( Table 2 ) and Tas (Table 3 ). All six assays resulted in efficient RT-qPCR assays, ranging from 94 to 103% (Table 2) with melt curves resulting in a single peak, indicating the amplification of a single amplicon (Supplementary Figure S1) .A conservative limit of quantification was established based on results from ddPCR experiments using Nsp10. Results from a five-fold serial dilution series indicated that quantification was linear down to around 50 copies (Supplementary Figure S2a,b) . In order to determine whether this was the approximate threshold of reliable and reproducible quantification, seven individual dilutions of the template were subjected to ddPCR assay. The results establish that this assay can reliably quantify 41 ± 12 copies of viral target (Supplementary Figure S2c ,d), although this limit is lower if additional probes are used (see below). In order to translate this to an RT-qPCR limit of detection (LOD) for viral targets, the sample containing 50 copies was diluted further to nominal 10, 5, 2 and 1 copies and subjected to qPCR amplification using the Nsp10 assay. This resulted in the detection of 5 copies by 12/12 replicates and two and one copies by 10/12 and 8/12 replicates, respectively (Fig. 2a) , with similar results obtained with Nsp12 (Fig. 2b) . A repeat experiment using the dilution that had a predicted two-copy per Comparison of assay performance; individual or multiplex assays. To reduce sample processing time, reduce reagent usage and increase throughput it was desirable to optimise the assays to run in multiplex. Two viral targets (Nsp10 (FAM) and N-gene (Texas Red), JUN (Cy-5) and EICAS2 (HEX) panels were combined to form the initial assay. Cq values obtained from assays run individually were compared with those obtained in the multiplex reaction. The assays perform equally well in both conditions ( Fig. 3 , supplementary data file Table 5 ) with only JUN amplification being approximately two cycles later in the multiplex reaction. This was solved by increasing the JUN primer concentration to 1.3 µM (Supplementary data file Table 5a ). The performance of the two EICAS assays and their effect on the amplification of the other markers was compared by carrying out four replicate multiplex RT-qPCR with either EICAS1 or EICAS2 as the internal control. Results were similar, suggesting that the inclusion of the additional primer set required for EICAS1 had no detectable adverse effect on assay performance (Supplementary data file Table 6 ).For validation of this test panel, 1 µL RNA was used per sample to reanalyse all 28 clinical samples and our results were 100% concordant (Table 3 ; Cqs are shown in supplementary data file Table 7) .For sample A8, Broomfield Hospital recorded discordant ORF1ab/N-gene results but these were positive for both markers when tested with our panel. Six positive and four negative samples were also tested using a commercial diagnostic kit (Sansure), with comparable results. In this case, the commercial kit did not detect one of the viral targets (ORF1ab) in sample B1, which was detected both at Bromfield Hospital and with our panel. There was significant correlation between Cqs recorded for Nsp10 and N-gene (r (95%CI) = 0.96 (0.89-0.98) as well as between Nsp 10 or N-gene and JUN (r = 0.73 (0.45-0.88) and 0.86 (0.68-0.94, respectively (Supplementary Figure S3 and supplementary data file, Table 7 ). An analysis of all clinical samples using the D614G genotyping assay revealed that all isolates harboured the A to G transition, characteristic of the more infectious phenotype, whereas the control clinical sample and Twist BioScience control 1 were both wild type, A, at this location (supplementary data file, Table 7 ).Inclusion of the EICAS template in the assay panel permitted some analysis of the quality of RNA extracted from patient samples. If inhibitors of the RT or the PCR were present in the clinical samples, an increase in Cq was expected for the EICAS assay compared with no template control samples, analogous to the principle underlying the SPUD assay 19 . An analysis of the 28 samples revealed little, if any inhibition, with a median Cq Table 7a ). The C to T transition at the − 9 position in the Nsp10 F primer binding site of isolate MT412262 did not impede the binding of the CoV2-ID F primer to mutant target (Supplementary Figure S4a) . The reverse was also true, in that the mutant primer bound efficiently to the WT target (Supplementary Figure S4b) . In each case the qPCR data were in broad agreement with the ddPCR results. Targets with mutations at positions − 10 and − 7 at the N-gene primer binding site were also efficiently amplified by the CoV2-ID F primer (Supplementary Figure S5c) , as was the WT sequence by the two mutant primers (Supplementary Figure S5d) . Since a mutation had been identified for three isolates (MT506889/506904/506907) at position 2 of the 5′-end of the N-gene probe, the effect of that mutation on the efficiency of amplicon detection by the N-gene probe was also investigated. Two specific probes were synthesised, one with (MuN) and one without (N-Pr2) the mutation at position 2 of the probe. Both gave virtually the same results (Supplementary Figure S5a) , as did an alternative probe with WT sequences (Supplementary Figure S5b) . The performance of both CoV2-ID and mutant primers with their respective templates was further analysed using an annealing temperature gradient analysis, which showed that the mutations had little effect on assay performance below 65 °C. Details of all underlying data for both qPCR and ddPCR results are listed in the supplementary data file Tabs 8, 8a, 8b and 8c. Table 2 . Details of oligonucleotide sequences, fluorophores, optimal concentrations and annealing temperatures used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 targeting Nsp10, N-gene, Nsp12, JUN and EICAS, collectively referred to as CoV2-ID. All oligonucleotides are listed in the 5′-3′ direction. Nucleotides that differ from the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence, but have been detected at low frequency are shown in red. Table 9 ). To test this concept, Nsp12 was added as a third viral target to the four plex CoV2-ID assay, making it a five plex, with two of the viral targets being detected on the FAM channel. The results confirmed a reduction in Cq in the FAM channel, without affecting any of the other results (Supplementary Figure S7 , with underlying data in supplementary data file Table 10 ). Performance of the four-and five plex assays was further assessed in four additional patient samples and the results indicated that they performed comparably, with the viral targets being detected earlier in the five plex assay (Supplementary Figure S8 , with underlying data in supplementary data file Table 11 ). Finally, in order to determine whether the sensitivity of the assay could be increased further, the five plex assay was modified so that all three viral targets (Nsp10, Nsp12 and N-gene) were detected with FAMlabelled probes. Both qPCR ( Figure S9a ,b) and ddPCR (Supplementary Figure S9c ,d) data revealed that there was indeed a further increase in sensitivity (data in supplementary data file Table 12 ). Development of rapid cycling conditions. In order to further improve the potential throughput of the assay in a diagnostic setting, the ability of the assay to perform adequately under short RT times and fast PCR conditions was tested. Baseline Cq data from the initial conditions of 10 min RT, 5 s denaturation and 10 s polymerisation were obtained for all three viral targets. Then RT time was reduced to 5 min, followed by stepwise reduction of both denaturation and polymerisation times to 1 s each, although in practice, the annealing/ polymerisation step took around 6 s, as the fluorescence scanning required around five seconds. There was no decline in the performance of the assay, but the run times were reduced from 33 min 40 s to 20 min (Fig. 4a , with data in supplementary data file Table 13 ). The initial 5 s/10 s and final 1 s/1 s conditions were applied to replicate five plex assays, and the results confirmed that all panels could be run using this protocol ( Fig. 4b ; with data in supplementary data file Table 13b ).The next aim was to try and reduce run times by further reducing the RT times. The results shown in supplementary Figure S10 (underlying Cqs are in supplementary data file, Table 14 ) suggested that a 1-min RT step resulted in Cqs similar to the 5-min RT reaction, reducing run times to 16 min.Reductions in run times could also be achieved on instruments not designed to run as fast as the PCRMax/ Techne, as shown for the BioRad CFX. Here the reduction in RT time from 10 to 1 min and cycling times from 95 °C/5 s and 60 °C/20 s, to 1 min RT and 1 s each at 95 °C and 60 °C reduced the run time from 58 to 32 min. The Cqs from seven targets present at a wide range of concentrations were compared and there was very little difference. Indeed, most of the targets recorded slightly lower Cqs with the fast run (supplementary data file, Table 14a ).Since the cooling step is the slowest part of the PCR cycle in block-based qPCR instruments, reducing the temperature gap between denaturation and annealing/polymerisation temperatures should further reduce run times. Following an initial calibration run with a 1 min RT step followed by 1 s 95 °C denaturation and 60 °C annealing/polymerisation steps, denaturation temperatures were reduced and annealing/polymerisation temperatures were increased. Even without further modifications to primer or enzyme concentrations, the small differences in Cq (Fig. 5 , with Cqs in supplementary data file, Table 15 ) indicated that this would be a potential method to reduce reaction times further, in this case from 16 to 14 min 11 s.Multiple cycle fluorescence detection. We have developed a multiple cycle fluorescence detection (MCFD) protocol linked to a 5-level rating algorithm. This resulted in faster run times and permitted the inclusion of the quantitative information inherent in qPCR without the confusion surrounding the use of quantifica- www.nature.com/scientificreports/ tion cycles. The feasibility of using this method rather than real-time detection was tested by comparing the performance of the two approaches using the same master mixes. As the PCRMax/Techne software does not permit a PCR run to be carried out without collecting fluorescence data, the experiment was carried out on the BioRad CFX. Whereas the standard qPCR run took 43 min to complete, the MCFD run took just over 22 min. The results for five different concentrations of viral target, together with the NTC control are shown in Fig. 6a , with the proposed algorithm in Fig. 6b . All underlying MCFD data are shown in supplementary data file Table 16 .Quantification potential. The inclusion of ddPCR quantified, internal EICAS, facilitates an indirect measurement of copy number, thus allows this RNA to function both as a measure of quality control, as well as an assessment of viral load. The same quantity of Nsp10 target was detected using qPCR as well as digital PCR. The results shown in Supplementary Figure S11a demonstrate how the reported Cq depends on the threshold setting, which is subjectively set by the operator or automatically determined by a software algorithm that can vary between runs and instruments. This interferes with accurate quantitative reporting of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, as the highest and lowest threshold-dependent Cq recorded in that run varies by 8.7, ie corresponds to a 400-fold difference. In contrast, the copy numbers calculated using the ddPCR platform showed little variation, recording an average Table 17 .The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, has led to the development of a wide range of diagnostic assays, many of which are RT-PCR based, utilise real time detection and report a Cq value to indicate presence or absence of the virus. However, it has become increasingly clear that there are significant shortcomings in the use and interpretation of many of these assays for testing and monitoring populations for viral spread. This has resulted in some confusion as to whether these diagnostic assays are capable of adequately addressing their three main functions: First, to identify patients presenting with symptoms consistent with COVID19 as SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative. Second, to provide a meaningful assessment of viral load, given that Cqs are subjective and not sufficiently reproducible or robust to allow an appraisal of the validity of marginal results, i.e. those around cycle 35. Third, to monitor the spread of virus using screening programmes of populations and environmental samples, allowing that a high percentage of those infected remain asymptomatic. In general, the most critical features of a diagnostic assay are high specificity and sensitivity, with reliability, speed, and ease of use also being highly desirable. In addition, where large numbers of samples are processed, cost saving on reagents is a serious consideration. Well-designed RT-qPCR assays certainly fulfil the first two criteria and have the potential to meet the remaining ones. Each of the three scenarios above requires a subtle variation on assay design and application. In the first case, the assay must be highly specific, reliable, sensitive and rapid. At this stage a binary positive or negative readout is sufficient. However, in the second scenario where therapy may be informed by an indication of viral load, the assay requires the same features with the addition of a quantitative assessment. Finally, widespread screening protocols benefit from low cost, high throughput and require simple binary readout without the absolute requirement to reduce time. The assay described in this communication, termed CoV2-ID, has been developed to be adapted to any of the situations described.CoV-2-ID offers maximum sensitivity by targeting three viral targets and detecting their presence using the same fluorophore, building on a previous report, which used two hydrolysis probes to increase the sensitivity www.nature.com/scientificreports/ of a SARS-CoV-2 assay 21 . This is appropriate for a diagnostic test, which does not need to distinguish between different viral targets and increases the sensitivity by around threefold, thus improving on currently used commercial assays. Whilst it may be desirable to measure viral load in patients exhibiting COVID-19, there is considerable misunderstanding with regards to the quantitative interpretation of diagnostic RT-qPCR test results. These are routinely recorded as stark Cqs, which can be rather misleading. When RT-qPCR is used to quantify gene expression, Cqs are normalised against reference genes, with amplification efficiencies determined by dilution curves 22 and meaningful quantification dependent on efficiencies being similar between targets of interest and reference genes. Importantly, if not normalised, Cq values are subject to inherent inter-run variation 23 and are operator, reagent-and instrument-dependent. Huge variations in Cq value ranges of up to 21 Cqs, the equivalent of a 2 × 10 6 -fold difference, have been reported for the same clinical virology run controls run in different laboratories 24 . Consequently, results are not readily comparable when carried out using different master mixes, instruments and analysis criteria and should not be used without appropriate calibration standards 17 . Since Cq values are affected by numerous parameters, not least by operator intervention with regards to threshold settings, as shown in Supplementary Figure S11 , they must not be used quantitatively and should not be used to determine viral loads. Hence, in the absence of certified controls or even validated standards, the inclusion of the EICAS RNA control template, quantified by ddPCR, allows not just monitoring of the RT-qPCR reaction but also quantification of viral load. It must be stressed, however, that any quantitative data will still be laboratoryspecific, and that use of the EICAS must be validated separately and repeatedly in different laboratories. The EICAS serves additional control functions in the assay: It provides an indication of potential inhibitors of the RT or PCR within the sample and has the potential to serve as an RNA extraction control. The addition of an intron less human gene control permits screening of samples for nucleic acid content regardless of whether DNase is used during sample preparation.The single tube reaction format, with low volumes and all reagents premixed, results in a simple workflow and we have minimised RT and qPCR times 20 to generate an assay that can be run in less than 20 min on a suitable instrument. Furthermore, since it is useful to run a diagnostic test as quickly as possible, we have combined endpoint and real-time analysis by measuring fluorescence towards the beginning of the run and then monitoring any increase at defined intervals thereafter. This permits the detection of target-dependent amplification, whilst at the same time saving the considerable time it takes to scan a plate at the end of each cycle. Our data demonstrate that this results in fast run times, even on an instrument such as the BioRad CFX, which is not optimised for maximum speed. The incorporation of defined fluorescence detection cycles into a reporting algorithm also has the advantage of allowing the quantitative aspect of qPCR to be used to generate a viral load determination, without resorting to the use of a subjective Cq or controversial cut-off point. This algorithm associates increases in fluorescence with a 5-level ratings system that can be used to inform further action, with any patient testing at level 1 being retested immediately. Importantly, this protocol can be applied to most conventional qPCR instruments, in contrast to a recent report that requires specialist instrumentation 25 .It is widely accepted that SARS-CoV-2 mutations are arising constantly, although there is still no evidence for the evolution of distinct phenotypes in SARS-CoV-2 26 . Nonetheless, a SARS-CoV-2 variant carrying the Spike protein amino acid change D614G has replaced the original D614A variant in many locations [27] [28] [29] . This mutation increases infectivity 30, 31 and may increase the severity in infected individuals 32 , although it remains unclear what the impact of the mutation on transmission, disease, and vaccine and therapeutic development is 33 . These data certainly support the finding that this variant is ubiquitous, as all of the UK isolates tested back as early as 14th April carry the D614G mutation.Although human coronaviruses harbour a proofreading exoribonuclease, a number of location-specific mutations have been identified in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 that result in potential mismatches with all published primer and probe sequences (https ://covid 19.edgeb ioinf ormat ics.org/#/assay Valid ation ) 15 . Hence, it is important to continue monitoring any assay, so as to sustain routine scrutiny of sequence mutations in primer and, to a lesser degree, probe binding regions of the viral genome, as recommended by the American Society for Microbiology COVID-19 International Summit 34 . CoV2-ID targets three viral genes, as this allows scope for the test to remain accurate even if mutations arise at the 3′-ends of the primers that could result in false-negative results. Our analysis of the effects of mutations in primers suggest that their impact is limited, as long as they are not at the 3′-ends of the primers. Variants with C to T transitions at positions − 9 and − 10 and an A to T transversion at position − 7 of the N-gene present a frequency of 0.006% 35 displayed no difference in sensitivity compared to the WT assay. Two mutations within the N-gene probe binding site, one a G to T transversion at 5′-end nucleotide 3, the other a C to T transition at nucleotide 5 with respective frequencies of 0.053% and 0.029% also had no discernible effect on sensitivity.CoV2-ID is presented as an adaptable assay that can be applied to all SARS-CoV-2 detection and quantification applications. In presenting the development of this assay we also sought to provide maximum transparency for the verification process, effect of protocol variations and the requirement for adequate standards and controls in order for the assay to be reliable and robust. The current pandemic has revealed shortcomings in global response procedures and it is essential that public health institutes, regulatory bodies and standards organisations adopt a shared set of guidelines, protocols and standards that allow a common and meaningful interpretation of any emerging molecular testing regimen.In conclusion, we have used the MIQE guidelines to design, develop, optimise and validate CoV2-ID, an enhanced, value-added RT-qPCR assay specific for SARS-CoV-2. It is robust, sensitive and is optimised for a rapid protocol, providing the opportunity for high throughput, multiplex viral detection with the potential to quantify viral load. Its design minimises the likelihood of assay failure causing false negative test results and its robustness provides a promise for its further development as an extreme PCR assay for use with point of care devices.

c6167843bfbdaa166cf6cd1c56d41612d6fdd674,Personal View Lancet Infect Dis 2020 A decentralised point-of-care testing model to address inequities in the COVID-19 response,"By mid-October, 2020, more than 37 million cases of COVID-19 had been diagnosed in over 215 countries, and over 1 million deaths. 1 The highest rate of cases per 1 million population has been reported in the USA at 48 526 cases per 1 million, followed closely by Brazil. 2 In Australia, daily case counts rose sharply in March, 2020, with a trajectory similar to the outbreaks experienced in China, Europe, and the USA; 3 however, rapid public health control measures led to a steady decrease, with many jurisdictions now observing few or no cases per day, except for a major resurgence in one jurisdiction from June to September. 4 Overall in Australia, the case rate of 1099 cases per 1 million population is much lower than that of the USA, UK, and Europe. 2 A close examination of the epidemiology shows that, in many countries, COVID-19 has disproportionately affected vulnerable people in society, including Indigenous people. 5 In the USA, non-Hispanic American Indian, Alaska Native, and non-Hispanic Black people are overrepresented in the number of diagnoses and hospitalisations. 6 In Brazil, Indigenous populations (many located remotely) have higher case fatality rates than do the rest of the population. 7, 8 In Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (hereafter respectfully referred to as Aboriginal people), particularly individuals living in remote areas, were identified as a vulnerable population early in the pandemic. 9 Fortunately, to date, Aboriginal people account for a low proportion of cases (0·5%) relative to the proportion of Aboriginal people in Australia (3%), and very few cases have been reported in individuals living in remote communities. 4 However, ongoing strategies are needed to protect Aboriginal people in Australia, who are vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19 for many reasons.First, Aboriginal people have high rates of comorbidities, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, with individuals living in remote or very remote areas of Australia having 1·4 times the burden of disease compared with the general population living in major cities. Therefore, these individuals are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality related to COVID-19, 10 as evidenced by the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, in which Aboriginal people comprised 2·5% of the Australian population but accounted for 16·0% of hospitalisations and 9·7% of intensive care unit admissions. 11 Second, many remote Australian communities have housing shortages and overcrowding, with the average household size reported as 11 people per house in some areas, compared with the Australian average of 2·6, 12 making physical distancing virtually impossible and increasing the risk of rapid transmission. Mathematical modelling for the Australian Government's COVID-19 response showed that an undetected case in a remote Aboriginal community in Australia would spread rapidly via overcrowded housing and mixing between households. 13 Third, nearly 20% of Aboriginal people live in remote areas of Australia, 14 where there is usually only one primary care clinic staffed by small teams of registered nurses and Aboriginal health practitioners, supported by resident or fly-in-fly-out doctors and specialists. 15 Emergency care frequently requires medical evacuation to tertiary care, 16 and there are lengthy delays in access to pathology results due to distances between the health centres and laboratories. 17 Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, specific guidelines were developed for remote Aboriginal communities. These guidelines recognised that although self-isolation is recommended while people wait for their test results, it is often impractical in remote communities char acterised by large families living in close proximity. For these reasons, the guidelines recommend that any suspect COVID-19 case in a remote Aboriginal com munity should be air-lifted out of the community while waiting for test results.Additionally, if cases are detected, any community action is agreed on in partnership with community members. Possible actions include relocating older or sick residents, restricting move ment, and testing all community residents (including asymptomatic individuals). 18 Airlifting individuals out of the community while waiting on test results is a resource-intensive process, which can be avoided with access to rapid test results.Globally, there is an urgent need for new testing models to improve access to rapid test results. In many countries, people live in rural and remote areas where access to COVID-19 testing requires several hours or days' travel to the primary health centre, whereby speci mens are then transferred to a centralised laboratory for testing, creating substantial barriers to timely results. In this Personal View, we describe a framework for the implementation of decentralised point-of-care (POC) PCR testing in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Australia, using and expanding an existing network of GeneXpert platforms introduced for the diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections, to improve access to timely COVID-19 testing in remote communities. A formal evaluation of the programme is planned and will be reported elsewhere. We are unaware of any other similar models implemented in remote primary care clinics.Since April, 2020, we have developed and implemented the COVID-19 POC testing programme for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (hereafter referred to as the programme), in partnership with jurisdictional government health departments, the Aboriginal community-controlled health sector, industry, and laboratories. The framework that supported the programme involved site selection criteria, gover nance and community engagement, policies and guidelines, risk and quality management, training and protocols, connectivity and reporting systems, and supply manage ment and costs (figure 1).The GeneXpert platform was selected for the programme because a network of decentralised primary care facilities was already operating a GeneXpert platform for testing of sexually transmitted infections. 19 In addition, the Xpert Xpress severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) assay for use on the GeneXpert platform was regulatory approved in March, 2020, and was the only PCR that could be used at the POC. 20 The Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay (Cepheid, CA, USA) is an in-vitro SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test with results available in 45 mins, 21 and is authorised for use outside of the laboratory setting in Australia and elsewhere. 20, 22 Single-use disposable cartridges hold the PCR reagents and host the PCR process for testing purposes. 21 The GeneXpert sys tem consists of a GeneXpert platform, barcode scanner, laptop computer, and integrated Xpert DX software for running tests and viewing results. The test cartridges are self-contained, reducing the risk of cross-contamination and operator risk at the testing site. Each cartridge requires a testing kit consisting of a swab and viral transport medium, and any viral transport medium can be used. During the programme, we changed from using a universal viral transport medium to a molecular transport medium (Longhorn, TX, USA), which preserves the integrity of the RNA, 23 is useful for transport of specimens, and inactivates the virus, rendering the sample noninfectious, 24 thereby increasing POC test operator safety.With more than 150 remote Aboriginal communities in Australia, and a global shortage in Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridges, site inclusion criteria were developed to identify priority health services for the programme (panel 1). Participating services were agreed on by a series of jurisdictional and national governance committees. To optimise coverage and benefits of POC testing, a so-called hub-and-spoke model was established, in which a health service designated as a testing hub had the GeneXpert platform installed, and small, nearby community spokes collected specimens and transported them to the hub services for COVID-19 testing on the GeneXpert platform. By October, 2020, 86 health services were participating in the programme across six jurisdictions (figure 2). A further 67 services are planned to act as spoke sites, increasing the reach of the programme to over 150 remote communities.The programme was established with a governance model that ensured national and community ownership of outcomes. The programme was funded by the Australian In each jurisdiction, committees were formed, including representatives from the Department of Health, reference laboratories, state and local Aboriginal communitycontrolled health services and their peak bodies, government health services, and programme staff. Key issues arising from the jurisdictional meetings were raised at the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander COVID-19 Advisory Group and this group also approved the final selection of participating services. Each jurisdiction adapted the programme framework to suit their local structures.The development of programme governance, training, competency, quality and risk management, and infection control procedures were aligned with the current National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council guidelines for POC testing in Australia and its associated advisory notes (April, 2020). 25 Additionally, the programme aligned with evolving recommendations from the Public Health Laboratory Network, a group of expert public health microbiologists in Australian and New Zealand laboratories, 26 and with the series of national guidelines on COVID-19 produced by the Communicable Diseases Network Australia. 27 Early in the COVID-19 response, national and international guidance was developed on laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, including that respiratory samples should be handled and processed within a biosafety cabinet due to the risk of aerosol generation. 26 However, by April, 2020, there was no specific guidance on the use of POC PCR assays outside of a laboratory, despite GeneXpert and other assays being approved by regulatory bodies in many countries. Use of biosafety cabinets or other containment devices in primary care facilities is not feasible or affordable, and the Xpress SARS-CoV-2 testing process minimises the risk of infectious aerosols given that it involves a few sample manipulation steps and that the PCR procedures are completed within a closed, single-use cartridge. 21 Therefore, the programme requested specific guidance from the Public Health Laboratory Network on SARS-CoV-2 POC PCR testing outside of a biosafety cabinet, and the network requested guidance from WHO. On April 15, 2020, the Public Health Laboratory Network released a statement recognising the diff erence between traditional laboratory-based testing and POC testing. 26 On May 13, 2020, WHO released a statement confirming that molecular POC testing assays, such as GeneXpert, ""can be performed on a bench without employing a biosafety cabinet, when the local risk assessment so dictates and proper precautions are in place"". 28 New guidelines were also required on the use of POC testing, whereby a working group, convened by the Australian Government, developed recommendations on the rational use of POC testing in primary care settings (panel 2). 291 The site must be at least a 2 h drive away from a laboratory testing facility 2 The site must provide services to a single community of at least 500 Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders; or is a hub health service that provides testing to spoke communities with a total population of at least 500 people, and has reasonable road access to the hub community; or is a health service on an island 3 At least three staff members must be employed by the site to ensure staffing capacity within the service Sites were required to fulfil all three criteria to be considered as a priority health service. A standard risk assessment matrix was adapted by use of the most reasonable consequence and likelihood of the consequence (ie, COVID-19 infection) occurring without risk mitigation strategies in place. Following this assessment, risk mitigation strategies for each task were identified and ranked according to the local relevant legislation. These processes guided the site suitability assessment and training procedures. These mitigation strategies led to the residual risk rating for the programme processes to be categorised as low. Analytical quality for the programme was managed by regular internal quality control and external quality assurance tests. To be consistent with routine specimen types, positive and negative internal quality control swabs were prepared by the University of Queensland Centre for Clinical Research (Herston, QLD, Australia) by use of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 clinical viral isolate (POW004) 30 and permissive Vero E6 cells in culture (immortalised African monkey kidney cells, ATCC CRL-1586) sourced from the Doherty Institute (Melbourne, VIC, Australia). Heat inactivated stocks were then diluted to reach 1 × 10⁶ TCID 50 /mL viral titre before use. The quality control swabs were transported with routine postal services and refrigerated on arrival, overcoming a key barrier related to maintaining cold chain in transportation to geographically remote settings. 31 Health services were required to test one posi tive and one negative quality control sample per month. If quality control results were not concordant with expected results, the operator contacted the programme help desk for troubleshooting. Internal quality control results were collated and monitored by the programme's quality management scientific team.External quality assurance (proficiency testing) specimens were manufactured specifically for this POC programme by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia Quality Assurance Program (Sydney, NSW, Australia). Two external quality assurance deactivated respiratory specimens were dispatched to each participating service 5 months apart. Testing was done by competent GeneXpert operators with a blind sample format, and results were returned and reviewed for acceptable test results by the programme's scientific team on quality management.Informed by the standard risk assessment matrix, a formal site assessment was done at each eligible health service. Programme staff worked with each health service to ensure the service's suitability for participating in the programme. Key site requirements included: having a room to place the device that was well ventilated, away from high throughput areas, and had access to infection control supplies (eg, personal protective equipment [PPE], alcohol solution, and bleach); adequate health service staff and COVID-19 pandemic management plans in place; electricity and internet connectivity; and on-site operators who were required to complete prerequisite training in COVID-19 infection control prac tices, PPE training, and hand hygiene before attending POC testing training. Following successful site assess ment, each service was able to formally register by completion of programme registra tion forms that outlined training, quality assurance, and reporting requirements to enable participation in the programme.A comprehensive training resource package developed for the programme consisted of standard operating procedures, Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, associated reference posters, and quality management documents, among other documents (appendix p 1). These programme documents can be requested through the programme. The training aimed to provide test operators with the following skills that relate to SARS-CoV-2 testing: infection control measures; documentation; operation of the GeneXpert device; how to prepare and test patient samples; quality management; how to prepare and test quality control and external quality assurance samples; and general maintenance, cleaning, and disinfection procedures.Health service staff completing POC operator training were required to complete theory and practical components. For theory training, operators were required to successfully complete a multiple-choice written assessment following the theoretical presentation. Practical competency was assessed by successful completion of A technical support help desk, operating during business hours, was established to enable POC operators to telephone or email queries about device operation and troubleshooting. Additionally, a 24 h on-call telephone hotline was provided and staffed by a senior medical scientist, to whom any positive or presumptive positive patient test results were referred. On receipt of a call, the scientist would immediately (remotely) log in to the device on which the positive or presumptive test was done to collate details regarding recent quality testing results and information on cycle threshold values for the positive sample, so that an assessment of the analytical validity of the result could be reviewed. Consultation with the relevant clinical staff and a jurisdictional public health representative would then take place to establish the follow-up actions regarding the positive result.A multifaceted, adaptable connectivity framework was developed to meet the clinical and public health data requirements of each jurisdiction, and to provide crucial data to monitor programme implementation and quality assurance (figure 3). It is envisaged that these systems will be used for POC testing of other infectious diseases.A set of public health and key performance indicators were developed for the programme. With data from the programme's centralised database, two reporting dashboards were created with Tableau Desktop software: a public-facing dashboard, hosted on Tableau Public, and Due to the fluctuating international supply of Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assays, a dynamic supply model was established, in which supply numbers were regularly adjusted with smaller and more frequent deliveries (3) (4) (5) (6) week cycles) than usual circumstances. However, this model allowed for the flexibility to respond to an outbreak. In addition to regular use, the supply model provided health services with an additional internal surge capacity, in case SARS-CoV-2 assays were needed during outbreaks. Test deployment and usage were monitored in real time with connectivity systems to ensure that no stockouts occurred. A central surge capacity was also established, whereby SARS-CoV-2 assays were held in centralised urban or regional-based locations to enable rapid deployment, along with a surge capacity team to respond to outbreaks and test contacts. Additionally, jurisdictions have also agreed to provide a supply, if needed, during an outbreak. Excluding programme management and set-up costs, the main drivers of cost per test in this setting were staff time for sample preparation and processing, followed by the SARS-CoV-2 cartridges, collection kits, and PPE. A formal cost-effectiveness analysis is underway.The implementation of a decentralised POC testing model is feasible in some of the remotest lands of Australia to enhance access to testing and to reduce time to results, and we have identified a series of enablers and challenges that should be considered when implementing elsewhere (panel 3). The framework could be adapted for use in other high-income countries to enhance the response for Indigenous communities. The framework could also be used in low-income and middle-income countries, where many people live in rural and remote areas with limited or no access to laboratory testing. In many low-income and middle-income countries, GeneXpert platforms are already located within provincial and regional hospitals for tuberculosis management 32 but are often not used at full capacity, providing an opportunity to leverage existing infrastructure in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Outside of hospitals, the framework could be used at large rural health facilities, • New POC testing policy required (only laboratory guidance existed beforehand) • Limited supply of tests with quantities only known weekly, requiring frequent deployment and transport • Frequent modifications to GeneXpert and middleware software required for optimal connectivity • The dynamic nature of the COVID-19 response, resulting in regular protocol changes • Health service staff time constraints and turnover of remote health service staffhub-and-spoke models, or mobile outreach models to rapidly deploy to locations of epidemiological concern. Decentralised use of platforms capable of detection of multiple pathogens might also enhance capacity and autonomy in infectious disease testing. 33 Many of the protocols and systems established are also relevant for high-performing antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests. Although registered by several health authorities, many tests are less sensitive than PCR, ranging from 0% to 94% (average 56%). 34, 35 However, a test with a sensitivity of 90% is better than no test at all, particularly if it can be scaled up. Two new funding initiatives (WHO's Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator and the National Institutes of Health's Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics) aim to accelerate equitable access to POC PCR tests and high-performing rapid diagnostic tests. 36, 37 In October, 2020, WHO listed two rapid diagnostic tests as emergency use for detecting SARS-CoV-2, and announced a partnership to ensure that 120 million of these tests are available for low-income and middleincome countries. 38 Overall, decentralised POC testing models could enable rapid public health responses, minimise further transmission and adverse patient outcomes, and reduce the burden on secondary and tertiary health facilities. Further investment to maximise the supply of POC tests and associated consumables is urgently needed.BH and RG conceptualised the Personal View.

efdc631170dec13bd79b7673742cc0da13482f43,Discovery of Cyclic Peptide Ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Pro- tein using mRNA Display,"has led to substantial morbidity, mortality and disruption globally. Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the viral spike protein and affinity ligands to this surface protein have the potential for applications as antivirals and diagnostic reagents. Here, we describe the affinity selection of cyclic peptide ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) from three distinct libraries (in excess of a trillion molecules each) by mRNA display. We identified six high affinity molecules with dissociation constants (KD) in the nanomolar range (15-550 nM) to the RBD. The highest affinity ligand could be used as an affinity reagent to detect spike protein in solution by ELISA, and the co-crystal structure of this molecule bound to the RBD demonstrated that it binds to a cryptic binding site, displacing a -strand near the C-terminus. Our findings provide key mechanistic insight into the binding of peptide ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and the ligands discovered in this work may find future use as reagents for diagnostic applications.The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to widespread morbidity and mortality and has resulted in crippling effects on the global economy. At the time of writing there had been > 77 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and >1.7 million deaths resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infections. Since the first reported case of COVID-19 in the province of Hubei, China in December 2019, there has been an intense global research effort centered on the development of an effective vaccine for the control of the disease. Very recently, two mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, respectively) and a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, from Oxford University and AstraZeneca) have completed phase III clinical trials and demonstrated a favorable safety profile and promising efficacy. [1] [2] [3] In addition to the requirement for a vaccine, effective antiviral drugs are also critically needed for COVID-19 treatment; these drugs will be particularly important for use in unvaccinated individuals, in cases where the efficacy of a vaccine wanes or the virus develops resistance to vaccine-induced responses. 4 While several candidate antiviral molecules are already in clinical trials, none were developed specifically for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, even the most promising of these, including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir and type I interferon therapy, have been deemed Figure 1 . Cartoon depicting the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor, a key step in viral entry (endocytic entry route shown). Inset: crystal structure (PDB: 6LZG) showing the interaction between the N-terminal helix of ACE2 (blue) and the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (grey).ineffective or only modestly efficacious in clinical trials. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Thus, in addition to investigations into the repurposing of existing drugs, there is an urgent need for the development of novel molecules that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 for the treatment of COVID-19. These molecules may also find use for immediate deployment in situations where SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic, including for pre-exposure prophylaxis in high-risk populations, or for further SARS-CoV outbreaks, e.g. through future zoonoses.The critical initiating step in viral infection involves entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, a process that is mediated by interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein with cell-surface angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Figure 1 ). 14 Crystal structures of RBD-ACE2 complexes have elucidated the mechanism of this interaction and shown that the RBD-binding site on ACE2 is located on an N-terminal helical region, distinct from the catalytic site (Figure 1) . 15, 16 Importantly, it has recently been demonstrated that blocking this interaction (through addition of either soluble RBD protein or soluble ACE2 protein) potently inhibits viral infection of cultured cells in a dose dependent manner. [17] [18] [19] These data provided early evidence that the RBD-ACE2 interaction was a valid target for the development of novel antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several approaches have since been adopted for the discovery of novel RBD binding ligands, including full antibodies, 20-28 as well as antibody fragments such as VH domains, 29, 30 nanobodies 31-35 and monobodies. 36 In addition, engineered ACE2 mimetics/decoy receptors, 37-39 de novo designed miniproteins, 40, 41 peptide-based ACE2 mimetics 42, 43 and synthetic peptide libraries 44 have also been reported that are capable of binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD.Macrocyclic peptides are a class of molecules demonstrated to be highly effective at disrupting protein-protein interactions, particularly in cases such as the spike-ACE2 interaction where a defined binding pocket is lacking. [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] In this work we explored this chemotype for the development of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding molecules that block the spike-ACE2 interaction, with a view to discovering novel inhibitors of viral entry. To discover novel cyclic peptides we employed cyclic peptide mRNA display, an approach that enables the generation of libraries of >10 12 macrocyclic peptides that can be subsequently selected against the target of interest, in our case the RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 1 ).To identify ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we performed three parallel affinity selections using very high diversity macrocyclic peptide libraries (Figure 2A ). Two of these were genetically reprogrammed Random non-standard Peptide Integrated Discovery (RaPID) libraries, comprising thioetherclosed macrocyclic peptides (one initiated with N-chloroacetyl-L-tyrosine and one initiated with N-chloroacetyl-D-tyrosine). The third comprised disulfide-closed macrocyclic peptides. In each case, a semi-random DNA library was transcribed into mRNA, followed by covalent ligation to puromycin and in vitro translation to yield a cyclic peptide-mRNA fusion library in excess of 10 12 unique molecules. Following counter selection (to remove streptavidin ligands), each library was panned against biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD immobilized on streptavidin beads, and an enriched DNA library was recovered by RT-PCR. After seven iterative rounds of this process, the final DNA library was sequenced to identify peptide ligands predicted to bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with high affinity (see Supporting Information). From this sequencing we chose nine diverse and enriched peptides for further evaluation: three L-tyrosine initiated, three D-tyrosine initiated, and three disulfide closed cyclic peptides ( Figure 2B ).The nine target cyclic peptides 1-9 were subsequently synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). Specifically, the target peptide sequences were first assembled on Rink amide resin using Fmoc-strategy SPPS (Scheme 1). For peptides 1-6 the N-termini were derivatized with chloroacetic acid (Scheme 1A), while the N-terminal methionine was N-acetylated in 7-9 (Scheme 1B). Each of the peptides was subsequently cleaved or G) codons were transcribed into mRNA, covalently ligated to puromycin (to allow conjugation between each mRNA and its cognate peptide), translated in in vitro reactions and reverse transcribed to afford very high diversity (>10 12 molecules) peptide-mRNA:cDNA libraries. Iterative rounds of affinity selection against recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein followed by recovery of the DNA by PCR and re-synthesis of the peptide-mRNA:cDNA library were conducted to enrich for SARS-COV-2 RBD ligands. In two libraries, the initiating N-formyl-methionine residue was genetically reprogrammed to N-chloroacetyl-L-tyrosine or N-chloroacetyl-D-tyrosine (DY), which spontaneously cyclizes to a downstream cysteine residue to form a thioether. A third library included an additional cysteine residue affording cyclic peptides through disulfide formation. B) Sequence alignment of the nine enriched unique peptide sequences from each library chosen for further characterization. from resin with concomitant side chain deprotection by treatment with an acidic cocktail. It should be noted that, despite significant optimization of the solid-phase synthesis, the precursor linear peptides to 5 and 7 were generated with significant sequence truncations (as judged by LC-MS analysis after the cleavage step); these peptides were also poorly soluble in both aqueous media and organic solvents. We therefore chose to re-synthesize these two sequences with a hexaethyleneglycol solubility tag on the C-terminus. Given that the RaPID peptides were panned on the RBD bearing a large mRNA tag on the C-terminus, we were confident that this modification would not influence the binding affinity to the RBD 55, 56 (Scheme 1). For the thioether-linked peptides 1-6, the linear peptide precursors were cyclized by treatment with Hünig's base in DMSO or acetonitrile/water mixtures (depending on the solubility of the linear peptides, see Supporting Information). In contrast, the disulfide-linked cyclic peptides 7-9 were generated through oxidation of the linear cleaved peptides by incubating in aqueous ammonium bicarbonate. Purification of each of the macrocyclic peptide targets by reverse-phase HPLC afforded 1-9 in 2-14% yield over the iterative SPPS and cyclization steps.With the synthetic cyclic peptides 1-9 in hand, we next assessed the ability of each to bind to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Briefly, RBD was expressed and purified before immobilizing onto a CM5 SPR chip using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) chemistry according to the manufacturer's protocol (see Supporting Information). Of the nine cyclic peptides screened, the six N-chloroacetylated peptides all exhibited high affinity for the RBD with dissociation constants (KD) in the nanomolar range (KD = 12 -550 nM, Table 1 , see Supporting Information for SPR sensorgrams). The highest affinity of these was peptide 4, with an observed KD = 15 nM against RBD and a markedly low rate of dissociation (koff = 1.4 x 10 -3 s -1 ). Interestingly, this molecule is a higher affinity cyclic analogue of a linear RBD ligand recently identified through an affinity selection-mass spectrometry approach. 44 Peptide 5 was also notable in the series with a KD = 76 nM against the RBD. The disulfide-closed peptides showed very high apparent RBD affinity, but also strong non-specific binding (data not shown). Based on these data we selected peptides 4 and 5 for assessment of antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Table 1 . Binding kinetics and dissociation constants (KD) for the 9 SARS-CoV-2 RBD cyclic peptide ligands synthesized and evaluated against the RBD by SPR. * peptides contain C-terminal hexaethylene glycol moieties; # refractive index values high on sensorgram; NSB = non-specific binding (see Supporting Information for sensorgrams).The antiviral activity of 4 and 5 was assessed in VeroE6 cells using high content fluorescence microscopy. Briefly, the cyclic peptides and SARS-CoV-2 were pre-incubated for 1 h and then co-incubated with VeroE6 cells for 72 h (MOI 0.5) within 384well plates. SARS-CoV-2 infection under these conditions leads to viral cytopathic effects (CPE) and cell loss that is correlated to the level of available infectious virus in the initial inoculum. Addition of inhibitors that bind the RBD of the spike protein, thus preventing interactions with cell surface ACE2, e.g. monoclonal antibodies, reduce CPE/cell loss in a dose dependent manner. [20] [21] [22] To enumerate the reduction of CPE in high content, live cell nuclei were stained using Hoechst 33342 (Nu-cBlue) and then the entire 384-well plate imaged (see Supporting Information). Nuclei were then counted in high content using InCarta image analysis software used to give a quantitative measure of cytopathic effect (see Supporting Information). Unfortunately, despite their nM affinities for RBD, neither 4 nor 5 showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 up to a concentration of 10 M. Additionally, no inhibition was seen in a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirion neutralization assay at peptide concentrations of up to 50 μM (see Supporting Information). These data Scheme 1. General scheme depicting the synthetic route to A) thioether cyclic peptide targets 1-6 and B) disulfide linked cyclic peptide targets 7-9.were corroborated by biolayer interferometry (BLI) experiments, in which 4 and 5 were unable to disrupt the interaction between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD (see Supporting Information).Although disappointed with the lack of antiviral activity of the RBD-binding cyclic peptides, we rationalized that the affinity of the peptides could instead prove useful for detection of the spike protein. In order to assess this possibility, we developed an ELISA-based detection assay for the full spike ectodomain and the spike RBD. Peptides 4 and 5 were first re-synthesized bearing a C-terminal biotin tag (see Supporting Information). ELISA plates were first coated with BD-218, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody identified from a COVID-19 patient. 28 Either spike ectodomain trimer or RBD alone was captured and then detected with biotinylated 4 or 5 and HRP-conjugated streptavidin ( Figure 3A) . In a second strategy, ELISA plates were directly coated with spike or RBD protein and antigen detected as above ( Figure 3B) . Gratifyingly, detection of both the RBD and spike ectodomain was possible with biotinylated 4 and 5, however 5 had substantial non-specific binding, as evidenced by detection of unrelated protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA). In further quantitative assays, biotinylated 4 allowed detection of spike ectodomain trimer at concentrations as low as 30 ng mL -1 (see Supporting Information). Finally, we sought to understand the mechanism by which peptide 4 binds to the RBD. To this end, we obtained crystals of the RBD-4 complex and solved the structure of the complex by Xray crystallography to a resolution of 3.96 Å (Figure 4 ; PDB code 7L4Z). Despite the relatively low resolution, we could identify the binding site of peptide 4, which lay near the clearly N-and C-termini of the RBD ( Figure 4B and Figure S7 ). Unexpectedly, the peptide binds to a cryptic region of the RBD by displacing a C-terminal -strand of the domain ( 523 TVCG 526 ) with residues 5 VVYG 8 of the peptide, which adopt essentially the same backbone conformation and make corresponding interactions with the RBD. Interestingly, a similar motif is observed in a linear RBD peptide ligand ( 1 TVFG 4 ; Figure 4C ) that was previously identified by affinity selection-mass spectrometry by Pentelute and co-workers. 44 Ala mutagenesis of this 13residue linear peptide highlighted the importance of the motif, particularly residues Val2 and Gly4, which are also present in the sequences of both the RBD C-terminus and peptide 4. It is therefore tempting to speculate that a similar mode of binding for RBD would be observed for the linear peptide that was discovered through an independent affinity selection method. The peptide-binding site is distal from the ACE2-binding interface ( Figure 4A) , providing a rationale for the lack of antiviral activity. Within the context of the full-length spike protein, peptide binding would only be achieved if the C-terminal -strand of the RBD undergoes a similar rearrangement to what we observe in our RBD-4 crystal structure. Moreover, conformational changes in the regions directly flanking the RBD domain would also be required, as the helix formed by peptide 4 residues 9 YNAWIR 14 would otherwise clash with these regions. Although peptide 4 could differentially detect spike when the latter was immobilized either by direct adsorption or indirectly via BD-218 antibody capture (Figure 3 ), we were unable to detect an interaction between 4 and spike using SPR under the conditions tested (see Supporting Information). Together, these data suggest that spike may undergo conformational changes that expose the peptide-binding site when directly immobilized onto plates, and that 4 may therefore be useful in detecting full-length spike using ELISA-based approaches.In summary, we have shown the utility of cyclic peptide mRNA display for the discovery of high affinity ligands to a viral glycoprotein, specifically the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We identified six peptides that bind to the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with nanomolar dissociation constants, including two with KD values <100 nM. While these peptides were unable to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells, we identified a 15residue cyclic peptide (4) which was capable of selectively and quantitatively detecting SARS-CoV-2 spike or RBD protein in an ELISA-based detection assay. Moreover, we solved the structure of 4 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. The unexpected binding mode of the cyclic peptide adjacent to the Nand C-termini of the domain suggests that significant structural reorganization of the spike protein would be necessary to accommodate the ligand. The binding of the ligand distal to the ACE2 binding site of the RBD explains the lack of antiviral activity of the cyclic peptide. Importantly, while there have been more than 120 structures of RBD-ligand complexes deposited in the protein data bank over the past 12 months, this represents the first structure of a peptide complexed with the domain, and the first structure of a ligand bound in this cryptic site. This binding mode is likely made possible by the small size of cyclic peptide 4 that enables it to access the compact site on the RBD. A similar binding mode would be difficult to achieve with ACE2 mimics, antibody and antibody fragments that have been the primary focus of RBD-and spike-binding ligands to date. Future work in our laboratories will capitalize on the unique binding mode discovered here by investigating cyclic peptide 4 (and analogues thereof) as easily accessible and cheap reagents for use in rapid, reproducible and simple ELISA-based quantitation of virally expressed SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in patient or environmental samples. Furthermore, the location of this new binding site adjacent to a recently discovered fatty acid binding pocket on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD raises the interesting possibility of designing lipid-linked variants of 4 ( Figure 4D ). 57 This hybridization approach may lead to molecules that possess improved affinity for the spike RBD, as well as antiviral activity.No unexpected or unusually high safety hazards were encountered during the course of this research.

37d8392d4afebe8ab816fd055562ffb0978cdb5e,Screening for a Potential Therapeutic Agent from the Herbal Formula in the 4 th Edition of the Chinese National Guidelines for the Initial-Stage Management of COVID-19 via Molecular Docking,"Coronavirus can cause multiple system infections including respiratory, digestive, and neurological systems in humans and other mammals [1] . e novel variant SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the subfamily of beta coronavirus. is makes the new virus the third zoonotic human coronavirus identified in this century. e last two zoonotic human coronaviruses which wreaked havoc in the global health system in the last CoV-2 Infection (Trial version 4), in most of the cases, the common symptoms are fever, drowsiness, and dry cough. In severe cases, serious symptoms may rapidly emerge, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy. e susceptive groups are young children and elderly people [5] . Since the beginning of this epidemic, researchers have focused on new medications that could show potential to contain the transmission of the new virus and management of its collateral symptoms. e 4 th edition guidelines included the treatment including Chinese herbal medicine with 3 formulas to target 3 different stages of this disease. e symptoms in the initial stage of this disease are mild and relatively easy to manage compared to the severe stage. Herein, we aimed to investigate the modified herbal formula (Magnificent Atractylodes Rhizome powder; 神术散) designated for the management of the initial stage of this disease, namely, the stage of cold dampness stagnation in the lung, in Chinese medicine. It contains 9 herbs including e dosages of the ingredients are 15 grams for Atractylodes lancea ( unb.) Dc., 6 grams for both Amomum tsaoko Crevost et Lemarie and Ephedra sinica Stapf, and 10 grams for the rest of ingredients [5] . However, scientific evidence is presently lacking to justify the claim of its effectiveness for the management of this disease. e angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is viewed as the key protein in humans for the development of SARS-CoV-induced lung injury [6] . Since SARS-CoV-2 may target the same receptor to induce lung injury, it is proposed that computational molecular docking analysis is a feasible and rapid strategy to apply for the analysis of the interaction mechanism between the virus' spike glycoprotein and ACE2 receptor. However, there is presently no experimentally obtained structural model of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein deposited yet in the Protein Databank (PDB) (http://www.rcsb. org). Despite several published and ongoing studies performed using docking analysis for the virus' proteins and ligands, the protein models applied in previous studies are based on the protein models from the SARS-CoV virus. However, the genetic data of the new viruses are available from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). erefore, in this study, we have modelled the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 to examine the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and, in particular, to provide a molecular-level understanding of the difference in transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV.e binding sites of the binding complex of the spike glycoprotein of both viruses and ACE2 were identified. e chemical compounds from these 9 herbs were explored for their binding affinities with ACE2. Finally, the identified chemical compounds were screened for their pharmacokinetic properties including ADME and toxicity to find a therapeutic agent with good potential to be a pharmaceutical candidate.Glycoprotein and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2. e genetic information of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in PubMed with accession number as YP 009724390.1.1 was extracted into a FASTA format file. is sequence was used as input data for homology modelling in SWISS-MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/). Among the results, Model 2 was selected because of the high values of Coverage, GMQE, and QMEAN. Further detailed information is presented in the Supplementary SWISS-MODEL building result file and structure assessment file. e ACE2 protein structure was extracted from the Protein Data Bank with the PDB ID 1R4L in the PDB format. e ClusPro online server (https://cluspro.bu.edu/queue.php) was applied to perform protein-protein docking for SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and ACE2. Model 0 was selected out of the top 10 models in the balanced order (Supplementary ClusPro protein-protein docking file). e complex structural model was created and visualised using PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.2r3pre, Schrödinger, LLC., with various colours applied to label the different chains of these two proteins to facilitate visualization and interpretation.e binding complex of these two proteins was extracted from Protein Data Bank with PDB ID 6ACG (https://www.rcsb. org/structure/6ACG) in PDB format. e structural model was created and visualised using PyMOL with various colours applied to label the different chains of these proteins to facilitate interpretation.Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2. PDBePISA (https://www.ebi.ac. uk/pdbe/pisa/) was employed for the identification of binding chains and binding sites of the SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins and ACE2. e interface result and hydrogen bonds are summarized in Table 1 . e binding chains for the interactions of these two proteins were acquired from the interface result, while the binding sites were obtained from the results of the hydrogen bond analysis. Further detailed information is presented in the supplementary files with the file names as follows: SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 interface results, SARS-CoV-2 chain B and ACE2 (chain D) binding sites result, SARS-CoV-2 chain C and ACE2 (chain D) binding sites result, SARS-CoV and ACE2 interface results, and SARS-CoV chain C and ACE2 (chain D) binding sites results. e above-identified binding chains and binding sites from these two viruses were compared to elucidate the similarity and difference. Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative MedicineHerbs. e TCMSP server (http://tcmspw.com/tcmsp.php) is an open online database with a large number of herbal entries with ADME properties, providing phytochemical information [7] .e Chinese character names of the identified herbs were used as input data for the search (Table 2 ). e chemical compound results of each herb were screened by the designed selection criterion, namely, that the logP value is not more than 3. is is based on the theory that logP values of 2-3 had been recommended as the cutoff value for hydration, which has been established as a benchmark for the solubility of compounds [8] . e results were saved as PDB files via PubChem for further analysis. Chemical compounds without PubChem ID were extracted directly from the database. e chemical structures of the compounds with strong binding affinities (≥9 kcal/mol) are summarized in Table 3 in Results. e chemical structures for the compounds with binding scores in the range of −7 kcal/mol to −9 kcal/mol are presented in the supplementary table. Protonation states for titratable sidechains of the protein were based on those assigned using OpenBabel (OpenEye Scientific Software, Santa Fe, NM, USA) at pH 7. Gasteiger charges were applied to protein and ligands. Docking boxes were set using the ""maximise"" option in PyRx around the protein receptor in order to enable ""blind"" docking, in which the entire protein surface and accessible interior pockets were made available for potential binding of ligands. All dockings were performed with the default exhaustiveness value of 8. e dockings were semirigid, with full torsional flexibility allowed for the ligands, while the protein receptor structures were kept fixed. e cutoff value used to define strong binding affinity was set to be equal to or more than 7.0 kcal/mol. erefore, the compounds with binding affinity values higher than this value were excluded for further study.e identified chemical compounds with binding affinity (≥7.0 kcal/mol) were searched in PubChem for antiviral activity evidence from bioassay results. e chemical compounds with active results from bioassay studies against respiratory infection virus that have similar symptoms with COVID-19 were summarized with the minimal concentrations, study types, and references provided in Table 4 .e identified chemical compounds in PDB format were translated into MOL files using ChemDraw 3D version. SwissADME (http://www.swissadme.ch/) and PreADME (https://preadmet.bmdrc.kr/) were applied to predict pharmacokinetic properties including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and toxicity. e results are summarized in a supplementary screening and prediction of ADME and toxicity table in terms of water solubility, Pharmacokinetic, Druglikeness, Medicinal Chemistry, Toxicity, and Eligibility. e screening criteria dictate that the chemical compound must be water-soluble, have high gastrointestinal absorption, satisfy Lipinski rule, Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2. e identified chemical compound and the ACE2 target were visualised in PyMOL to facilitate identification of specific residue interactions with active binding sites on the target. e PDBQT files of the binding ligand (chemical compound) and ACE2 obtained from AutoDock Vina were used as input files in PyMOL.e binding sites were highlighted in different colours and labelled with residue names.e predicted model of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 illustrated the interactions of these two proteins. Figure 1 shows the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein coloured by its 3 different chains, with green for chain A, cyan for chain B, and red for chain C. ACE2 is coloured in magenta. Figure 1 indicates that the chain B and chain C of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein both contact ACE2.For comparison, the predicted model of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 illustrating the interactions of these two proteins is shown in Figure 2 . e SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein is coloured by its 3 different chains, with green for chain A, cyan for chain B, and red for chain C. ACE2 is coloured in magenta. Inspection of the complex structural model shown in Figure 2 indicates that, in contrast to that of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, only chain C of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein is predicted to bind with ACE2.e interface result of the PDBePISA analysis for the binding complex of SARS-CoV-2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine spike glycoprotein and ACE2 confirmed that both the chain B and chain C of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein form binding contacts with ACE2 (chain D). Detail information regarding the interaction between each of the relevant protein chains, interface contact areas, and estimated free energies of interactions is listed in Table 1 . ese results suggest that chain B and chain C of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein contribute to the interaction with ACE2, with an estimated binding ΔG of −11.2 kcal/mol and an estimated ΔG of −5.3 kcal/mol, respectively. e hydrogen bonds predicted to be formed between chain B of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and ACE2 (chain D) showed that the main contributors to the interactions on chain B include THR333, ASN370, and ALA372. Likewise, the residues which make up binding sites on ACE2 included LYS600, SER254, and ALA614. e hydrogen bond-forming residues of chain C in SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein include GLU484, GLN493, LYS417, ASN487, TYR489, GLN493, and TYR505. Likewise, the binding site residues on ACE2 which contribute to its interactions with SARS-CoV-2 chain C include ASP157, ASN159, ASP615, SER280, TYR252, and TYR613. Further detailed information regarding these key interactions is listed in Tables 5 and 6.e interface result of the PDBePISA analysis for the binding complex of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein and ACE2 confirmed that the chain C of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein is the only chain which forms close contact with ACE2 (chain D), in contrast to SARS-CoV-2 in which both chains B and C form close contact. Further detailed information is listed in Table 7 .e hydrogen bond-forming residues of chain C in the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein and ACE2 (chain D) complex showed that residues on chain C involved in binding ACE2 Table 8 .Comparison of the predicted binding chains and binding sites of the complexes demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 had two chains (chain B and chain C) binding with ACE2, while in contrast, the SARS-CoV only had one chain (chain C) binding with ACE2. Examination of the specific residues involved in binding indicates that there is one common residue, at position 487, which is used by both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins to bind with ACE2. Table 4 .e chemical compound which satisfies the binding affinity and ADMET screening selection criteria is atractylenolide III from Atractylodes lancea ( unb.) Dc. (Cangzhu) with eligible water solubility, high GI absorption, eligible druglikeness and low hERG inhibition risk. All the other chemical compounds were excluded due to unsuitable water solubility, GI absorption, druglikeness, and toxicity. Specifically, oroxindin was excluded with the reason of low GI absorption. For Amomum tsaoko Crevost et Lemarie (Caoguo), quercetin 3-o-glucoside, hirsutrin, and hyperin were excluded due to low GI absorption, violations of Lipinski's rules, and high hERG inhibition risk. Quercetin 3o-rutinoside and quercetin 3-o-rhamnopyranosyl were excluded due to low GI absorption and violations of Lipinski's rules. For Citrus reticulata Blanco (Chenpi), hesperidin, hyperin, naringin, and orobanchoside were excluded due to low GI absorption, violations of Lipinski's rules, and high hERG inhibition risk. For Magnolia officinalis Rehd. et Wils. (Houpo) , neohesperidin was excluded for the reasons of low GI absorption, violations of Lipinski's rules, and high hERG inhibition risk. For Agastache rugosa (Huoxiang), acanthoside B, acteoside, and campneoside were excluded due to low GI absorption and violations of Lipinski's rules. For Notopterygium franchetii H. de Boiss (Qianghuo), chrysoeriol 7-rutinoside was excluded due to low GI absorption, violations of Lipinski's rules, and high hERG inhibition risk. Coumarin-glycoside was excluded due to low GI absorption and medium hERG inhibition risk. 6′-Feruloylnodakenin was ruled out due to low GI absorption, violations of Lipinski's rules, and medium hERG inhibition risk. For Ephedra sinica Stapf (Mahuang), cosmetin was excluded due to low GI absorption and high hERG inhibition risk. Hesperidin and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide were excluded due to low GI absorption, violations of Lipinski's rules, and high hERG inhibition risk. Rutin was excluded due to low GI absorption and violations of Lipinski's rules. Tilianine was excluded due to low GI absorption and medium hERG inhibition risk. Vitexin was excluded due to low GI absorption and high hERG inhibition risk. Further detailed information of each identified chemical compounds' pharmacokinetic property screening and prediction is summarized in Table 9 .e molecular graphic of the docking residue is shown in Figure 3 , showing the predicted interaction between ACE2 and atractylenolide III, shown in ribbon form in magenta, and atractylenolide III, Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine displayed as a ""licorice"" 3D structure. e key residues on ACE2 predicted to be involved in interaction with the ligand are also shown and involve a conventional hydrogen bond via ASN-149 (green) and pi-alkyl interaction via PHE 274 (yellow). As the binding results from hydrogen bond (H-bond) in chain B (Table 3) showed that SER254 can form a H-bond with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. e binding results from hydrogen bond in chain C (Table 6) showed that ASP157, ASN159, TYR252 on ACE2 can form the H-bonds with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. e ligand therefore binds in a region that shares a similar face as the ACE2 residues which are predicted to form contact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. e ligand may therefore serve to disrupt, or weaken, ACE2-mediated virus-host cell interactions acting via this surface. A 2dimensional diagram showed that the ASN 149 binding site in ACE2 is connected with a hydroxyl group in the molecule.e novel SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged to challenge the current medical system, exposing the shortfalls of existing pharmaceutical agents for its management.e Chinese Health Commission included Chinese herbal medicine amongst its current recommendations for disease management and have prescribed herbal formulas from its 4 th edition of SARS-CoV-2 virus management guidelines.In the initial stage, 9 herbs were prescribed for treating the symptoms, including chills, dry cough, dry throat, drowsiness, and chest tightness. Except Amomum tsaoko Crevost et Lemarie (Caoguo) and Areca catechu L. (Binglang), the other 7 herbs are among the highfrequency Chinese medicines for the management of pestilence throughout the history in China [19] . ACE2 receptors are viewed as the key protein in human for the development of SARS-CoV-induced lung injury [6] . Molecular docking was used to predict the binding mechanisms of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins to ACE2, and it was identified that residue 487 for both viral proteins played a role in their binding to ACE2. e residue at position 487 for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins has been proposed to be crucial for cross-species and human transmission for SARS-CoV [20] . Our results have echoed the findings from previous research that may strengthen the understanding of a similar role for the residue at this position of the new virus. Despite this similarity, there is still a large discrepancy between these two viruses in terms of binding chains and binding sites. ese differences may be contributed by their genomic sequence diversity [20] . e binding results showed that SARS-CoV-2 could have two chains binding with ACE2 receptor rather than SARS-CoV with one chain binding with ACE2. More chain bindings or interactions and more energy consumptions indicate much stronger binding affinity for this new virus [21, 22] . e simulation predicted that chain C for both viruses is critical for the binding activities with ACE2. For SARS-CoV-2, the residues in chain C are LYS 417, GLU 484, ASN 487, TYR 489, GLN 493, and TYR 505. From the findings in another in silico study with the same PDB ID (6ACG) protein for modelling, the residue in position 505 (−4.23 kcal/mol) plays an important role for spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in terms of the binding energy contribution in comparison with the residues in position 487 (−1.5 kcal/mol) and 489 (−3.0 kcal/mol) [22] . From another in silico study, the amino acid residues ASN157, ASN159, and SER 280 have contributed to the solvent at the surface of the ACE2 molecule (PDB ID : 1RIX) in the binding with SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins [23] .Molecular docking and pharmacokinetic screening were also used to identify atractylenolide III, from Atractylodes lancea ( unb.) Dc. (Cangzhu) as a therapeutic agent with strong binding affinity with ACE2, which also satisfy selection criteria based on pharmacokinetic properties. e key predicted binding site residues on ACE2 are ASN 149, which form a conventional hydrogen bond by one hydroxyl group in the molecule and ASN 149 in ACE2. e results from in vitro inhibition assay showed atractylenolide III with antiviral activity instead of the same analog testing compounds atractylenolide I and atractylenolide II. Since the hydroxyl group is the structural difference between atractylenolide III and the same analog compounds, it can be deduced that the hydroxyl group may play a key role in the inhibition effect against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [10] . e existing evidence could support the therapeutic potential of atractylenolide III for its antiinflammatory activity, anti-porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus activity, and heavy lung tissue distribution. Atractylenolide III (50 µM and 100 µM) possessed anti-inflammatory effects associated with the inhibition of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogenactivated protein kinases-(MAPK-) signaling pathways in lipopolysaccharide-(LPS-) induced RAW264.7 cells via suppression of the production of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) [24] . Intriguingly, atractylenolide III has been shown to possess inhibitory effects against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, which is of importance in the swine industry. is virus can cause similar symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection including fever, cough, and dyspnea. e 50% inhibited concentration (IC 50 ) was 99.6 µmol/L for this compound [10] . Atractylenolide III had been found to have high concentration level in the lung tissues of rats in pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution experiments [25] . It may shed light on the therapeutic potential of this compound for new virusinduced respiratory infections and inflammations. Despite the fact that our findings suggested other compounds with antirespiratory viral activity, the pharmacokinetic properties of these compounds are not eligible to be used as drug candidates. erefore, atractylenolide III is the sole compound with antirespiratory activity and eligible pharmacokinetic properties to be considered as a drug candidate in our study. is finding is based on in silico study with limited evidence. It is noteworthy that there is no existing evidence from clinical studies to prove the efficacy of this formula. In order to acquire more solid evidential support, further in vitro and in vivo studies are required. e safety of Chinese herbal medicine is often a concern for its application and marketing. From the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2015 edition, for the formula in the study, most of the herbs are safe to be applied but Citrus reticulata Blanco (dried tangerine peel; Chenpi), Ephedra sinica Stapf (ephedra; Mahuang), and Areca catechu L. (areca seed; Binglang) contain toxic substances. Aflatoxin can be found in both Citrus reticulata Blanco (dried tangerine peel; Chenpi) and Areca catechu L. (areca seed; Binglang). ere are strict restrictions for aflatoxin in these herbs. For both Citrus reticulata Blanco (dried tangerine peel; Chenpi) and Areca catechu L. (areca seed; Binglang), Aflatoxin B1 cannot exceed 5 µg per 1000 grams. Also, the total amount of aflatoxin G1, aflatoxin G2, aflatoxin B1, and aflatoxin B2 cannot be more than 10 µg. e toxic compound ephedrine in Ephedra sinica Stapf (ephedra; Mahuang) may raise the biggest concerns among all the herbs in the formula. A series of toxic events and adverse effects had been reported that included arrhythmia, hepatotoxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, and dilated pupils after application of ephedra. Despite such safety concerns, the safe application of ephedra can be safeguarded by different processing techniques [26] .In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 could bind with the ACE2 receptor at chain B and chain C to induce lung injuries in humans. e residue at position 487 may play a vital role as it did on SARS-CoV for the progression of lung injuries. Atractylenolide III is found to have a strong binding affinity with ACE2 by conventional hydrogen bond formation via ASN-149 and possess favourable pharmacokinetic properties, and it has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects and antiviral effects in a previous in vitro study and high distribution in the lungs in a previous in vivo study. All these findings support further research for the therapeutic effects of atractylenolide III for the management of this new virus.Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ADME:Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion H-bond:Hydrogen bond IL-6: Interleukin 6 LPS:Lipopolysaccharide MAPK:Mitogen-activated protein kinases MERS-CoV:Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus NF-κB:Nuclear factor-κB NO:Nitric oxide PGE2:Prostaglandin E2 SARS-Cov:Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus TNF-α:Tumour necrosis factor-alpha WHO:World Health Organization.Data Availability e data are available upon request to the corresponding author.e authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.Y.

0afddc0d3edb26c9095212a0a8c7f08892ffe7ff,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Manual Therapy Service Utilization within the Australian Private Healthcare Setting,"The novel coronavirus disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (COVID- 19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020 [1] . Major human events and natural calamities such as global pandemics have the potential to affect human behavior and access to resources, including healthcare seeking behavior and service utilization. There is emerging evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted a wide range of health services, including stroke emergency services [2] [3] [4] , medical imaging services [5, 6] , and hospice care [7] . However, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on manual therapy service utilization is unknown.In Australia, chiropractors, osteopaths, and physiotherapists are registered healthcare practitioners trained to diagnose, treat, and manage patients with musculoskeletal conditions. As of the first quarter of 2020, there were 5383 chiropractors, 2627 osteopaths, and 33,299 physiotherapists with general registration to practice in Australia [8] [9] [10] . The manual therapy services provided by these professions are predominately paid for by non-government sources (i.e., private health insurers and individuals). Studies have documented increased utilization of manual therapy services over time in Australia, albeit with diverging trends across professions [11, 12] . It has been estimated that approximately 21.6 million manual therapy services with a total cost of AUD 1.4 billion were provided within the Australian private healthcare setting annually in the period between 2013 and 2017, which represented a significant increase from the preceding five-year period [12] . It remains to be determined how these trends and figures have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.This study aimed to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on manual therapy service utilization within the private healthcare setting in Australia. The specific objectives were to quantify the absolute and relative difference between forecasted and observed number and total cost of services during the first half of 2020 for each manual therapy profession.Statistics on private health insurance industry activity in Australia are available from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) [13] . For the present study, we extracted quarterly data on the number and total cost of services for each manual therapy profession (i.e., chiropractic, osteopathy, and physiotherapy) from the first quarter (Q1) of 2015 to the second quarter (Q2) of 2020. We also extracted quarterly data on the estimated number of persons covered under private health insurance general treatment cover. A pyramid plot of the number of persons insured by sex and age group in 2020 Q2 is provided in Section A of the Supplementary Materials ( Figure S1 ). Statistics on registered healthcare practitioners are available from the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) and each profession's registration board [8] [9] [10] 14] . For this study, we extracted quarterly data on the number of registered providers from each manual therapy profession from 2015 Q1 to 2020 Q2. We did not include registrants listed as limited or non-practicing. We then estimated the number of providers working in the private sector for each profession as follows: For chiropractic and osteopathy, 100% of registrants were taken to be working in the private sector because neither of these professions contribute to service provision in the public sector. For physiotherapy, 63.5% of registrants were taken to be working in the private sector, as estimated by a National Health Workforce Report [15] .There are three types of private health insurance coverage in Australia: hospital treatment only, general treatment only, and combined hospital and general treatment. General treatment cover includes most services for preventing or managing injuries, diseases, and conditions that are provided outside of the hospital setting. However, it excludes services for chronic disease management that are covered by Medicare. A service was defined as one visit to a healthcare provider.All dollar values were adjusted for inflation using the Reserve Bank of Australia's online inflation calculator and reported in second quarter of 2020 Australian dollars [16] . The main outcome variables were number of services per quarter and total cost of services per quarter. The number of providers was used as the denominator to calculate the following secondary outcome variables: number of services per provider per quarter and total cost per provider per quarter. The number of individuals with general treatment cover was used as the denominator to calculate the following secondary outcome variables: number of services per 100,000 insured population per quarter and total cost of services per 100,000 insured population per quarter.Time series forecasting involved fitting seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models of service utilization data from 2015 to 2019 using the methods described by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos [17] . The seasonal ARIMA models provided estimates that account for seasonality and trends over time. Point forecast estimates with 95% prediction intervals for 2020 Q1 and Q2 were calculated from the seasonal ARIMA models and compared against observed values. The resulting mean errors and mean percentage errors were used as measures of absolute and relative impact. All statistical analyses were conducted using R, version 3.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) using the forecast and hts packages.For the three manual therapy professions combined, an estimated 1,322,370 (13.2%) fewer services were provided during the first half of 2020. The estimated reduction in total cost of services provided amounted to AUD 83,972,816 (11.5%). The combined estimated relative reduction in quarterly number and total cost of services provided was greater in Q2 (21.7% and 16.6%, respectively) than in Q1 (5.7% and 6.8%, respectively).During the first half of 2020, the estimated relative reduction in number of services provided was considerably larger in physiotherapy (20.6%) and osteopathy (12.7%) than in chiropractic (5.2%). Figure 1 shows a time series plot of observed values and point forecast estimates with 95% prediction intervals of the quarterly number of services provided by each manual therapy profession from 2015 to 2020 Q2. Similarly, the estimated relative reduction in the quarterly total cost of services provided was considerably larger in physiotherapy (17.0%) and osteopathy (13.1%) than in chiropractic (4.7%). Figure 2 shows a time series plot of observed values and point forecast estimates with 95% prediction intervals of the quarterly total cost of services provided by each manual therapy profession from 2015 to 2020 Q2. Table 1 provides an overview of observed values, point forecast estimates, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error of the quarterly number and total cost of services provided by each manual therapy profession during 2020 Q1 and Q2.

Table 1 provides an overview of observed values, point forecast estimates, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error of the quarterly number and total cost of services provided by each manual therapy profession during 2020 Q1 and Q2. The estimated relative reduction in number and cost of services provided during the first half of 2020 varied by Australian state and territory. The estimated relative reduction in number of services provided was largest in New South Wales (17.5%), followed by Australian Capital Territory (16.3%), Victoria (16.2%), Tasmania (15.0%), South Australia (10.3%), Queensland (8.7%), Western Australia (7.9%), and Northern Territory (0.3%).

Figures 3 and 4 are heatmaps depicting the estimated mean percentage error in number and total cost of services, respectively, provided by the three manual therapy professions during the first half of 2020 across Australian states and territories. Because the number of individuals with general treatment cover and the number of manual therapy providers varied from quarter to quarter, supplementary analyses were conducted using secondary outcome variables and are presented in the Supplementary Materials (Sections B and C, respectively). These supplementary analyses generated similar estimates of the percentage change in manual therapy service utilization.This is the first study to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on manual therapy service utilization. During the first half of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic coincided with approximately 1.3 million fewer chiropractic, osteopathy, and physiotherapy services provided within the Australian private healthcare system. The associated loss of revenue was estimated to be AUD 84 million. Physiotherapy incurred the largest relative reduction in service provision and revenue, while chiropractic was found to be the least impacted of the three manual therapy professions. Geographically, the largest relative reductions in manual therapy service utilization were observed in the south-eastern corner of mainland Australia (i.e., New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, and Victoria).Our findings show that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on manual therapy service utilization in Australia. It is not unexpected to observe disruption of health services during a global pandemic. While much of the initial disruption of health services has been characterized by the surge in demand for front-line care of COVID-19 patients, there has also been a concomitant reduction in or discontinuation of prevention and rehabilitation services for noncommunicable diseases. For instance, the World Health Organization reported that more than half of the countries surveyed had partially or completely disrupted services for the treatment or clinical management of hypertension, diabetes and diabetes-related complications, cancer, and cardiovascular emergencies [18] . A similar situation exists in Australia, where there have been marked reductions in a wide range of health services, including breast and prostate cancer screenings [19, 20] , pediatric orthopedic hospital services [21] , trauma care in Emergency Departments [22, 23] , and initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation by Emergency Medical Services in public areas [24] . It is important to note that our findings encompass only the initial disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It remains to be determined whether the decline in manual therapy service utilization persists beyond the first half of 2020, whether manual therapy service utilization returns to pre-pandemic levels after the virus has been eliminated, and whether economic factors such as sustained or transient changes in disposable income, uptake of private health insurance, and cost of services have any lasting effects on healthcare-seeking behavior and manual therapy service utilization. Future studies are encouraged to explore these unresolved questions.The magnitude of the decline in manual therapy service utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic was not uniform across the three professions, with physiotherapy and chiropractic experiencing the largest and smallest relative reductions, respectively. The exact reason for this difference is unclear, but it may be related to differences in revenue streams (e.g., proportion derived from private health insurance) and patient characteristics (e.g., level of disposable income) across the three professions [12] . For instance, as the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded and loss of income became more prevalent in the population, perhaps Australians have forfeited their private health insurance with general treatment cover as a cost-saving measure. While this explanation may sound reasonable given the circumstances, it does not explain why there was a larger decline in physiotherapy service utilization relative to chiropractic and osteopathy. Nor does it explain the fact that the results from our supplementary analyses of service utilization per 100,000 insured persons were very similar to our main findings, which suggests that any changes in the number of insured persons are unlikely to explain the observed differences. An alternative explanation may be differences in case-mix across the three manual therapy professions. Although this explanation is not supported by the scope of practice of the three professions, which all state that they diagnose and treat musculoskeletal conditions, industry reports indicate that physiotherapy provides more specialized services (e.g., neurological rehabilitation, geriatric services, and sports injury prevention and rehabilitation) than osteopathy and chiropractic [25, 26] . Thus, it is conceivable that public health orders and social restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., stay-at-home directives, limited access to aged care facilities, and shutdown of community sport activities) may have resulted in a marked reduction in utilization of specialist physiotherapy services. Although this may explain the larger relative reduction in physiotherapy service utilization (20.6%), it does not adequately explain the differences in relative reduction in services between osteopathy (12.7%) and chiropractic (5.2%). Further research is needed to examine the factors influencing healthcare-seeking behavior and manual therapy service utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic and to elucidate the underlying reasons for the observed differences across the three manual therapy professions.There are strengths and limitations of the present study. This research builds on our previous reports of manual therapy service utilization within the Australian private healthcare setting [11, 12] . We added an inflation adjustment for all dollar values to remove the effect of inflation from our analyses. More importantly, we applied sophisticated analytical techniques to produce forecasts that account for both seasonal variation and long-term trends across professions and geographical regions (i.e., states and territories). In an attempt to account for changes in the number of providers and people with private health insurance, we provided supplementary analyses using secondary outcome variables (i.e., number and total cost of services provided per provider and per 100,000 persons with private health insurance). These supplementary analyses produced very similar estimates of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on manual therapy service utilization. Lastly, because our study was limited to private health insurance data, the estimates presented herein can only be generalized to services provided under private health insurance general treatment cover.The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on manual therapy service utilization in Australia. The magnitude of the decline in service utilization varied considerably across professions and locations. The long-term consequences of this decline in manual therapy utilization remains to be determined.The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/8/4/558/s1, Section A: Figure S1 : Pyramid plot depicting the number of persons insured under general treatment cover by sex and age group in the second quarter of 2020; Section B: Figure S2 : Time series plot of observed values and point forecast estimates with 95% prediction intervals of the quarterly number of services provided per 100,000 insured persons by each manual therapy profession from 2015 to 2020 Q2; Figure S3 : Time series plot of observed values and point forecast estimates with 95% prediction intervals of the quarterly total cost of services provided per 100,000 insured persons by each manual therapy profession from 2015 to 2020 Q2; Table S1 : Observed values, forecast point estimates with 95% prediction intervals, mean errors, and mean percentage errors of the quarterly number and total cost of services provided per 100,000 insured persons by each manual therapy profession in Australia during 2020 Q1 and Q2; Figure S4 : Heatmap of the estimated mean percentage error in number of services provided per 100,000 insured persons by each manual therapy profession during the first half of 2020 across Australian states and territories; Figure S5 : Heatmap of the estimated mean percentage error in total cost of services provided per 100,000 insured persons by each manual therapy profession during the first half of 2020 across Australian states and territories; Section C: Figure S6 : Time series plot of observed values and point forecast estimates with 95% prediction intervals of the quarterly number of services provided per provider by each manual therapy profession from 2015 to 2020 Q2; Figure S7 : Time series plot of observed values and point forecast estimates with 95% prediction intervals of the quarterly total cost of services provided per provider by each manual therapy profession from 2015 to 2020 Q2; Table S2 : Observed values, forecast point estimates with 95% prediction intervals, mean errors, and mean percentage errors of the quarterly number and total cost of services provided per provider by each manual therapy profession in Australia during 2020 Q1 and Q2; Figure S8 : Heatmap of the estimated mean percentage error in number of services provided per provider by each manual therapy profession during the first half of 2020 across Australian states and territories; Figure S9 : Heatmap of the estimated mean percentage error in total cost of services provided per provider by each manual therapy profession during the first half of 2020 across Australian states and territories.

e04f5c932a1cf6152390037091eabd6a84565446,Priority allocation of pandemic influenza vaccines in Australia - Recommendations of 3 community juries,"The challenges of managing pandemic have become newly pertinent in 2020, as countries around the world struggle to manage SARS-CoV-2 infection in their populations [1] . Healthcare capacity has been overwhelmed, even in high-income contexts, and shortages of critical health care resources have resulted in rationing in many jurisdictions [2] . Intensive mitigation and suppression measures have led to a significant reduction in new cases in several countries. However, the economic impact of such measures has been severe with those in lower socio-economic positions worse affected [3] . In the absence of effective treatment for COVID-19, populations will remain at risk requiring governments to balance https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.12.010 0264-410X/Ó 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. the need to ease social and economic restrictions against the potential for surging case numbers [4] . The development of a safe and effective vaccine, typically an essential part of pandemic response plans, is now a shared global strategy for the longerterm control of COVID-19 [5] [6] [7] .More than a hundred vaccine candidates are in development as of late November 2020, with eleven already in phase III trials [8] .As new vaccines are licensed and become available, demand is expected to far outstrip supply in the early stages. One of the few precedents for vaccine distribution strategy in such a context is pandemic influenza planning; thus, governments are already looking to existing pandemic influenza management plans for guidance on strategies to distribute scarce vaccine [7, 9] .The WHO's Pandemic Influenza Risk Management guidance advises member states to establish which groups should be prioritised for initial vaccination, guided by ethical considerations and informed by local risk assessment [10] . The current Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza (AHMPPI) prioritises direct protection for groups who are considered likely to be at higher risk of severe illness, based on risk groups targeted by the seasonal influenza vaccination program [11] . Drawing on their plans for pandemic influenza, the World Health Organization (WHO) has published guidelines for managing scarce resources in COVID-19 prevention and care, recommending a framework for priority setting that considers context and extent of scarcity. It suggests equality of access, maximising best outcomes, prioritising those at greatest risk of becoming seriously ill, and prioritising essential workers, depending on scenario [7, 12] .Our paper is one of two in a series that aims to provide a framework for the prioritisation of vaccine allocation. In the companion paper, a cross-disciplinary research team was commissioned by the Australian Government Department of Health to undertake modelling and perform an ethical analysis to develop a flexible framework to guide the distribution of limited influenza vaccine supplies in the early phases of a pandemic response [13] . This framework recommends promotion of three overall objectives in health protection decision-making: (i) creating and maintaining trust; (ii) promoting equity; and (iii) focusing on outcomes. The first objective supports effective pandemic and post-pandemic healthcare management. The second attempts to redress preexisting disadvantage so that disparities in pandemic burden are not socially patterned. The final objective focuses on reducing the negative impacts of the pandemic while it is occurring and into the future. Outcomes include both harms (broadly, things that threaten people's essential interests) and benefits (things that impact positively on well-being of individuals and groups). The framework aims to achieve these objectives by establishing two priority levels for vaccine allocation. The first priority (Level 1) comprises two groups: frontline healthcare workers (HCW) and First Nations Australians. Vaccinating HCW who are likely to be in contact with COVID-19 patients reduces risk of infection and spread and ensures that the provision of care is not compromised by HCW who are ill or reluctant to attend work. Protected HCW maximises beneficial health outcomes for patients and promotes trust in healthcare settings. First Nations Australians are known to be at the highest risk of adverse outcomes in pandemics and experience considerable structural disadvantage [14] ; prioritising this group promotes equity. Level 1 groups are prioritized irrespective of other evidentiary factors. Less clear, however, is which groups should receive 'Level 2' vaccine access (that is, which groups should be next). Following distribution to Level 1 groups, Level 2 priority groups need to be defined consistent with the three overall objectives.Based on outcomes of the modeling on influenza pandemics described in the companion paper (see also supplementary materi-als), our framework proposed two strategies that could be used to distribute influenza vaccines among Level 2 groups and the remaining population [13] : the 'high-risk' strategy -which aims to provide direct protection to individuals at higher risk of severe illness; and the 'school-based' strategy -which aims to provide indirect protection to the population through vaccinating primary school children, who, in the case of influenza, are most likely to develop and spread infection.In Australia the annual vaccination program for seasonal influenza prioritises direct protection for high risk groups [15] . This strategy is adopted by many other high-income countries, with the notable exception of the UK. Seasonal influenza vaccination has been offered to British children, in a phased roll-out since 2013, for the dual purpose of protecting the children themselves and reducing transmission across all age groups to protect those at risk of severe outcomes [16] . While school-based programs for delivery of some vaccines to teenagers have been in place in most Australian states and territories since the 1970s (e.g. rubella, and more recently hepatitis B followed by HPV), adoption of a 'primary school' strategy for seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccines would be a significant strategic shift in Australian immunisation policy. The primary school strategy serves as a useful proxy for evaluating the acceptability of indirect vaccination strategies in general. It is important to note, however, that the suitability of vaccination strategies is always dependent on underlying disease epidemiology. In the context of COVID-19, for example, epidemiology so far suggests that children are not significantly affected, or driving disease transmission [17] , and so school-based vaccination should not be prioritised [2, 9, 12 ].The disease model described in the companion paper was also designed to inform decisions about whether to base the pandemic vaccination program on a 1-or 2-dose strategy [13] . Decisions about dosing strategies depend on early clinical studies of a pandemic vaccine to show whether it produces antibody levels considered sufficient for protection. In past pandemics, a single dose has sometimes been sufficient for older individuals. But if two doses are needed for full protection, a vaccine program may a) use limited vaccine supplies to fully protect fewer people; or b) provide partial protection to more people with just one dose. These alternative pandemic vaccine distribution strategies require different approaches to implementation, have different goals and allocate the benefits and burdens of vaccination differently (Supplementary Textbox 1).The WHO guidance document on pandemic preparedness emphasises the important role of the public in effective planning and response to an influenza pandemic [18] . Consistent with this, we conducted community juries in different parts of Australia to provide recommendations on how best to use limited vaccine resources in the event of an influenza pandemic, in collaboration with the Australian Government Department of Health Office of Health Protection. The modelling studies indicated that positive impacts from vaccine distribution strategy were only possible in the event of a pandemic with low virus transmissibility but high severity of illness among those infected (Supplementary Figs. 1 & 2) . Although SARS-CoV2 is a highly transmissible virus in many contexts, including Australia, widespread suppression measures have reduced transmission significantly. Thus although the influenza virus has different characteristics to SARS-CoV2, the current policy context is to some extent comparable. Based on the preliminary work described above, the question put to the juries and supporting evidence focused on a low transmission, high severity scenario ( Fig. 1 Textbox 1), the aim being to gather evidence about C. Degeling, J. Williams, S.M. Carter et al.Vaccine xxx (xxxx) xxx the acceptability and perceived legitimacy of two specific strategies for prioritising pandemic vaccine distribution in this situation, and reasons for acceptance or non-acceptance of these strategies.A citizens' or community jury meets for two to five days to carefully examine an issue of public significance [19] . Usually 10-15 members of the public serve on a jury, acting as a 'mini-public' or microcosm of the broader public [19, 20] . While a small group cannot statistically represent 'the general public', participants are recruited to capture a diversity of experiences and backgrounds in a community [21] , and so can suggest what an inclusive and informed public would advise, given factual information and time to deliberate [20, 22, 23] . Community juries have been used in Australia and elsewhere to consider issues surrounding infectious disease control and prevention [24, 25] , including the appropriateness of different measures that can be used in response to a pandemic [26] [27] [28] [29] .Formal deliberation is more than a dialogue and not just a debate. The deliberative process is designed to extend the thinking of participants beyond their own interests to think about whole-ofpopulation good and the collective needs of the community. To be considered robust and reliable deliberative processes must (at a minimum): (ii) ensure that a sufficiently diverse range of potentially conflicting, minority and marginal perspectives are considered; and (iii) create opportunities for free and open discussion and debate within and between citizens, experts and/or policy actors, to challenge and test competing claims.The method assumes that people can think rationally and change their views should the evidence warrant it [30] . Community juries are usually directed to consider a specific issue -typically formulated as a 'charge' (as in a court hearing). They hear from a variety of expert witnesses, question those witnesses, and deliberate together on the issue. The process is like a legal proceeding, but the outputs are not legally binding and consensus is encouraged but not required. When conducted in this way, community juries can provide perspectives that can inform policy recommendations and evidence of public values, concerns and arguments. Juries thus reflect the likely acceptability and public legitimacy of different policy alternatives, and provide an indication of what an informed public thinks should be done to address a specific issue [19, 20, 31] .There is a longstanding debate about the relationship between empirical and theoretical work in bioethics, which is beyond the scope of this paper [32] . This project is an example of empirical bioethics, which assumes that the moral judgements of members of the public have an important place in final determinations of the right thing to do [33] . What role public judgements should have in final determinations differs between research traditions. In particular, deliberative research methods are different from perhaps more familiar social science methods. They ''arise from political theory, enact an ideal form of democracy, and are intended to have direct and indirect consequences in governance"" [34] . Jurors engage with normative questions when they consider evidence. They make value-based decisions about what matters and provide researchers with insight about public moral intuitions and judgements and how they are enacted. Researchers can combine a highly contextual understanding of a particular scenario with ethical deliberation to draw normative conclusions. As a result, projects such as this can report descriptive outcomes -what did juries decide? -and normative recommendations -what do well-informed, inclusive groups of people say we should do, and for what reasons?We convened three community juries: Jury 1 in Wollongong (NSW), Jury 2 in Melbourne (Victoria) and Jury 3 in Kalgoorlie (Western Australia) -representing regional, metropolitan, and rural populations, respectively. All were held over two days (Saturday-Sunday) in April and May 2019.An independent research service was contracted to recruit jury participants, using randomly generated list-based samples of mobile and fixed-line telephone numbers, located in specific geographic areas, and a social media advertising strategy targeting those same areas. To reduce selection bias the social media advertisement was blinded as to the research topic area. The jurors were then selected purposively from the resulting pool of potential participants, to promote an approximate 50:50 gender split, and ensure a range of ages and socioeconomic and cultural diversity within each jury [22, 35] . Jurors were compensated $200 AUD for each day of their time.Each jury commenced with an orientation session to introduce the process, the questions for consideration and to seek consent. Day 1 focused on understanding: basic influenza virus biology (seasonal and pandemic strains); the individual and population impacts of influenza infection (during seasonal outbreaks and pandemics); different interventions to manage infection risks; influenza vaccinology including manufacturing pipeline and licensing; different pandemic vaccine distribution strategies; and different ethical perspectives on prioritising pandemic vaccine (Supplementary Table 1 ). Logistic considerations related to vaccine production and distribution were highlighted, as well as common challenges to vaccination program implementation.Testimony from four experts was pre-recorded and shown to jurors as video presentations -and are available online [36] . Experts were selected on the basis of their institutional roles, experience and expertise to provide balanced, factual information supporting different expert perspectives on the potential impacts, benefits and costs of direct or indirect vaccine protection strategies. Each presentation ran for approximately 25-30 min. Prerecording ensured the format of the evidence presented was standardised across juries. After each video presentation the expert was available by teleconference call or in person, for jurors to ask questions. These question and answer sessions, facilitated by a researcher, allowed jurors to clarify or question the evidence and opinions presented. Facilitation focused on promoting constructive dialogue and fair interaction amongst jurors. For the first hour of Day 2, jurors reflected on, discussed and debated the evidence, aided by a facilitator. Juries then deliberated for an hour, without facilitation, to reach a verdict on the questions posed. The verdicts, underpinning reasoning, and dissenting views were then reported to the research team in a final facilitated feedback session. Our research and reporting processes for these Community Juries were cross-checked against the CJChecklist protocol [37] .The three deliberative groups (juries) are the units of analysis in this study. All jury deliberations (facilitated and un-facilitated) and expert question and answer sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. To track changes in the positions held by individual jurors, participants completed an anonymous ballot at 4 timepoints during jury proceedings: (i) before any evidence had been presented at the beginning of Day 1; (ii) after having considered the evidence at the end of Day 1; (iii) after reflecting on it at home overnight at the beginning of Day 2; and (iv) after the deliberation and delivery of the verdict at the end of Day 2. Jurors also completed a process evaluation exit survey at the conclusion of each event. During the final session a researcher/facilitator recorded the verdict and reasons on a flipchart. Each point was reviewed by the jury to ensure accuracy. In what follows the characteristics of each jury are described; a summary of jurors' own descriptions of the rationale and reasoning that underpinned their responses to the questions is then provided.34 people were recruited across the three study settings ( Table 1 ). All juries included participants of both genders and a range of ages, but those in Melbourne and Kalgoorlie had more male than female participants. Compared with the national average educational attainment, jurors in Wollongong were skewed C. Degeling, J. Williams, S.M. Carter et al.Vaccine xxx (xxxx) xxx towards either higher or lower levels and those in Melbourne towards a slightly higher level. Participants in each jury resided in postcodes representing a range of 'socioeconomic indices for areas' (SEIFA) scores (a measure of average socioeconomic status of local areas) largely consistent with those of each study setting.PART A: At the end of jury proceedings all three Community juries voted to support a vaccine distribution strategy aimed at achieving indirect protection -Melbourne with an 10-2 majority and Wollongong and Kalgoorlie by consensus verdicts. The results of the time-point ballots represented in Table 2 demonstrate that the balance of the vote changed throughout each event, with support, after jurors had deliberated, swinging definitively behind strategies aimed at providing indirect protection.Jurors supported the goal of indirect protection during a low transmissibility/high severity pandemic. The key reasons given were fairly consistent, although there was some underlying differences in the values underpinning the positions in the three locations. Based on the evidence presented, jurors preferred the 'school-based' strategy over prioritising high-risk groups because it was most effective for everyone: more people would benefit from the available resources, not just those vaccinated. This was not a decision to deny protection for those in high risk groups, but about prioritisation. People at higher risk would be protected indirectly and, eventually, have the opportunity to be vaccinated and protected directly.Jurors argued that a strategy focused on protecting children would be more acceptable to the general public, and gave two central reasons for supporting the school-based strategy: maximising the utility of vaccine resources, and the moral significance of protecting children. The Wollongong group emphasised that ''kids are important"" and should be protected early; therefore indirect protection was construed as an ''extra benefit"". The Melbourne group was more concerned with maximising the potential utility of vaccine resources and thereby building community trust and maintaining social cohesion. The overarching goal of the Kalgoorlie jury was to exploit the potential utility of vaccine resources for population benefit and to maximise the number of people protected. The logistical efficiency of schools-based vaccination was also more appealing to jurors than relying on members of vulnerable groups to access primary care for vaccination. All juries emphasized that compassion for those at greater risk of severe illness was important, and two of the 12 Melbourne jurors voted to prioritise high risk groups in the early stages of a pandemic, out of concern for those at greatest risk of a severe illness. However, on balance, all three juries voted to use vaccine resources to maximise population health outcomes.PART B: At the end of proceedings, juries in Wollongong and Kalgoorlie voted in support of commencing the program with a 2-dose vaccine distribution strategy, whereas the Melbourne jury supported a 1-dose strategy. Table 3 shows that the juries were relatively evenly split on this question at the first ballot (before any evidence had been presented). The balance of the vote, at each poll, changed throughout proceedings, with 3-4 votes swinging definitively behind the preferred strategy, after each jury's final deliberations.The Melbourne jury supported adoption of a 1-dose strategy during the early phases of vaccine roll-out. They concluded that giving more people some protection sooner was fairer, would make more people feel safer, promote trust in authorities and, ultimately, help to maintain social order and cohesion. They argued that some people would not present for a second dose, risking loss of an opportunity to protect more people sooner, and wastage of time and resources, especially if one dose was found to be sufficient.In Wollongong and Kalgoorlie juries supported a 2-dose strategy during the early phases of vaccine roll-out, because starting with a 1-dose strategy without evidence of its effectiveness would risk wasting vaccine doses and may make the indirect strategy ineffective, and a 2-dose strategy would be more likely to promote public trust in vaccine effectiveness because fewer vaccinated people may become infected. Juries strongly argued that authorities should be transparent about uncertainty regarding dosage. While acknowledging that a 1-dose strategy might be seen as rapidly helping more people, these juries argued for maximising effectiveness until the efficacy of a single vaccine dose was known.When asked what citizens should be told about why different groups will get earlier access to vaccines during a pandemic, jurors at all three sites told us that the population health value of the indirect approach -i.e. that it protects more people, including those at higher risk of severe illness -and why vaccine would be limited, initially, would need to be explained.Juries were also asked about strategies to manage a high transmission/high severity pandemic: a scenario that would more closely approximate an unmitigated SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The Wollongong and Melbourne juries voted to retain an indirect protection strategy because: a) children are important and worthy of prioritization (given greater emphasis in Wollongong); b) a simple school-based (rather than risk-group based) strategy would be easier to defend, publicly (important for both Wollongong and Melbourne); and c) it was more likely to maintain trust and social stability (given greater emphasis in Melbourne). In contrast the Kalgoorlie jury drew on evidence they had heard that, in a high / high severity pandemic, an indirect protection strategy was unlikely to provide a transmissibility population benefit, and argued for directly protecting those most at risk of severe illness. Notably, the reasons given by each group for these different positions align quite closely with their key reasons for supporting an indirect protection strategy, namely: protecting children (Wollongong); maintaining social cohesion (Melbourne); and, maximising the potential utility of vaccine resources (Kalgoorlie).Most pandemic plans around the world do not substantively attend to ethical considerations in prioritising scarce pandemic vaccine. Those that do emphasise the need for procedural justice, usually explicated as a set of principles embedded in response decision-making and communication [13, 38] . Ethical justifications for prioritising particular groups tend to be utilitarian, maximising 'good' by minimising illness and death in those most at risk. The recommended framework in our companion paper for Australian priority vaccine allocation has three overarching objectives: (i) creating and maintaining trust; (ii) promoting equity; and, (iii) focusing on outcomes. These aims were communicated to each community jury in expert testimony, and ideas relevant to the priority that should be afforded to each of these aims also arose during jurors' deliberations.All juries affirmed that ensuring public trust was vitally important. Their decisions explicitly prioritised the need to create and maintain public trust in two key areas: public perceptions about effectiveness of pandemic vaccination; and, more broadly, how health authorities communicate with the public before and during a pandemic. Of relevance to the second and third objectives, all groups juxtaposed ideas of equity and best outcomes, saying that, while both were important, maximising population effectiveness was more critical in their decision making. All three juries supported providing indirect protection of the population, by vaccination of primary school children. They were not opposed, in principle, to prioritising groups at higher risks of adverse outcomes, but chose the indirect strategy based on evidence they had seen that it would be more effective and efficient. Given the apparently limited role of children in transmitting SARS-CoV2, alternative groups would need to be identified and vaccinated in an indirect protection strategy, based on best evidence of effectiveness and implementability. The current study supports the findings of previous deliberative research in Australia [26, 27] , which indi-cates that while informed publics generally support prioritisation of high-risk groups on equity grounds, as in the current AHMPPI [11] , given the opportunity to consider the trade-offs entailed, they prefer that vaccine resources be used, optimally, to maximise utility and benefit the broader population while also working to sustain social order.Including members of the public in deliberation forums can provide local sources of evidence for those planning and implementing pandemic policy and anticipate local issues which may support or impede successful implementation. Decision-making during a pandemic must take into account both evidence-based models and likely community acceptability of the chosen policy [39, 40] . Unless they ask, decision-makers can only speculate on what the public's values are, and are likely to be unaware of the extent to which the perspectives of different groups in society might be aligned; for example, the potential for the school-based strategy to provide indirect population protection and a previously identified strong preference (measured by a population survey), among many people, to give highest priority to protecting children during a pandemic [41] . In the case of COVID-19, indirect immunisation strategies are unlikely to be targeted at children, potentially leading juries to reach different conclusions about such strategies. As our results show, a shared consensus in public deliberations is not necessary to enhance the basis for decision-making; the reasons jurors provided for their support of either 1-or 2-dose vaccination strategies were coherent, well-reasoned, and depended on how each group responded to the probability of vaccine efficacy (1 dose 35% / 2 dose 70%), which highlights how difficult the choice will be without knowledge of the efficacy of a single dose. Public deliberations should include diverse perspectives to understand what is at stake for different groups and develop possible pathways for action [22, 23] . Publicity, transparency and deliberation can promote greater social and political engagement, public accountability and confidence in difficult policy decisions.Community juries are a deliberative method that involve a process of iterative two-way exchange of information between members of the public and experts. By providing extensive information from a range of experts, and ensuring conditions for reasonable and extended debate, independent community juries elicit more considered judgements than other social research methods such as surveys or focus groups. The sample size is small, but this is nec- essary for high-quality deliberation. Participants were asked to select between a pre-determined range of strategies. It is possible that there are other strategies participants would prefer. However, our design prioritised the direct policy relevance of the questions put to the jurors: that is, we put to the jurors the questions policymakers were asking, and wanted answers to. It is possible that other policy options would be more relevant for deliberation in other jurisdictions. A further limitation is that we did not collect data from participants regarding whether they were parents of school aged children such that we are unable to analyse any potential effect of this variable on jurors' reasoning.Defining clear and justifiable objectives for pandemic response in context aids development of flexible and adaptive decision support frameworks and facilitates clear communication and engagement activities. Previous deliberative research in Australia found public support for using limited pandemic vaccine resources to protect healthcare workers and maintain social services -largely driven by a desire to maintain societal functioning. The current study indicates the Australian public may also prefer distribution strategies aimed at maximising the utility of vaccines so as to provide population benefits through indirect protection, if time and resources allow. These findings have direct relevance for COVID-19, despite being undertaken for an influenza pandemic model, in that the initial supply of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be well short of demand and necessitate rationing. A key difference is the high susceptibility to infection in countries that achieved effective COVID-19 suppression, which will require vaccine prioritisation over a longer time period because more people may need to be vaccinated to achieve community protection. All groups agreed that transparency in communication and trust in authorities is paramount -a value given highest priority by our jury groups. Responsiveness to emerging evidence is also key, particularly in further identifying higher risk groups such as the elderly and those with co-morbidities [2, 12, 17] , and in determining optimal vaccination schedules. Once available, governments should communicate their vaccine allocation plans effectively and transparently, both to other levels of government and the public.

During the pandemic, several wards 65 were repurposed as dedicated areas to cohort patients with COVID-19 and were designated 66 ""COVID wards"". Maximum patient occupancy for COVID wards was reduced from standard 67 capacity to minimise density quotients for shared rooms, while maintaining sufficient staffing 68 to accommodate the increased time requirements for changes of PPE and additional cleaning. 69Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system was modified to supply 100% fresh air 124 intake and exhaust return air from the ward outside the building to avoid recirculation. Air 125 flow was adjusted to achieve a net negative pressure differential of 3-4 Pa to establish inward 126 air movement to the ward from adjoining corridors. At the time of the detection of the first 127 staff case on Ward A, the PPE worn by staff entering Ward A included P2/N95 respirators (a 128 change made prior to the formal updates in state and national guidelines in response to 129increasing HCW cases at other healthcare institutions and aligned with the decisions at those 130 institutions at the time 1, 9 ), face shield, isolation gown, and gloves. Most nursing and cleaning 131 staff worked exclusively on Ward A and were experienced in caring for patients infected with 132 COVID. Ward A shared the same PPE donning room and staff bathroom with another 133 adjacent COVID ward (Ward B), but had separate doffing areas (located immediately prior to 134 exiting each ward) and dedicated staff tearooms outside the clinical areas. 135The first case identified on Ward A returned a positive PCR test to SARS-CoV-2 in late July 137 2020 after developing mild respiratory symptoms ( Figure 3 and Table 1 ). Testing of contacts 138 identified Case 2, who had tested negative on two occasions in the previous week after 139 exposure to a positive HCW on another ward in mid July. Case 2 acknowledged having 140 respiratory symptoms when interviewed with an interpreter, and had worked six shifts during 141 the infectious period. All staff who had worked on Ward A during the infectious period were 142 tested upon detection of Case 2, and again at day 7 and 11 after last exposure on the ward. 143In response to the outbreak, staff break room policies were revised to apply stricter controls 173 to mitigate the potential risk of transmission (Table 2) .

d46c87714fceffdf6cdae0d3c11eb13c228783f7,"Impact of COVID-19 related unemployment on increased cardiovascular disease in a high-income country: Modeling health loss, cost and equity","The COVID-19 pandemic had infected 65 million people and caused over 1.5 million deaths globally at the time of writing (early December 2020). (1, 2) Unfortunately at this time, pandemic spread was still accelerating and so its final impact before widespread vaccination is used, is likely to be substantially greater.Globally, this pandemic has disrupted international travel and domestic economies (often via the use of ""lockdowns"" that depress normal consumer activity and close some workplaces). As such it has depressed gross domestic product (GDP) with this figure for OECD countries being by -10.5% in the second quarter in 2020, (3) and with an increase in unemployment by an absolute increment of 3.2% (8.57% in the second quarter vs 5.35% in the first quarter) (4) for these countries. (5) (6) (7) There is established evidence that economic recessions and depressions can increase poor health. (8, 9) This includes cardiovascular disease (CVD) (8) (9) (10) as per our recent review of this topic. (11) In particular, one meta-analysis, (9) which included 174,438 participants with a mean follow-up of 9.7 years and 1892 incident cases of CVD from 13 cohort studies, reported that increased job insecurity was associated with increased CVD incidence. Also, there is evidence that people experiencing economic hardship are at higher risk of CVD mortality. (8, 9, 12) Stress and loneliness (eg, potentially exacerbated by pandemic-related lockdowns) are also known risk factors for CVD onset. (13) (14) (15) According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, CVD is still the leading cause of death in the world at an estimated 17.8 million deaths. (16) In New Zealand (NZ), CVD makes up around 14% of all health loss nationally, and is responsible for a third of the total number of deaths annually. (17) CVD is a particularly important contributor to health loss for the Indigenous Māori population (17, 18) and it contributes to health inequities in NZ in terms of both ethnicity and socioeconomic position. (19) (20) (21) Although NZ has had a relatively successful health sector response to the COVID-19 pandemic (with an elimination strategy (22) ), the economic impact of the response (via lockdowns, lost revenue from international tourism and international students) has been severe. (23, 24) This study therefore aimed to quantify via modeling the health loss, health cost burden and health inequities due to CVD onset as a result of unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in NZ. (25, 26) We adapted an established and validated multi-state life-table model for CVD for the national NZ population. (27) (28) (29) We modeled only indirect effects (ie, higher CVD incidence due to high unemployment rates) arising from COVID-19 pandemic-related unemployment. Direct effects of the COVID-19 pandemic onto CVD were not considered since the disease burden (only 25 deaths as of 15 December 2020) has been relatively low in NZ prior to the elimination of community transmission. We used various scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on unemployment projections in NZ. (23, 30) The timeline for the pandemic impact on unemployment was for five years as per the Treasury projections, but a lifetime horizon was used for measuring benefits and costs (a five-year horizon was also implemented).The NZ Government stated that ""the COVID-19 pandemic is a 'once in a century' public health shock that is also having a profound impact on economic and financial systems around the world and in NZ."" (30) The Government also suggested that the impact of COVID-19 and related response measures on the NZ economy is highly uncertain. So the NZ Treasury presented four different economic scenarios based on health response measures and on key economic assumptions, including the reduction in production output in NZ, the Government's support for households and businesses, and world real production outputs. Detailed scenarios including the baseline unemployment projection before COVID-19, the base case and alternative scenarios (ie, earlier recovery in services exports, extended border controls, and resurgence in community transmission) are presented in Table 1 . The key estimates were that the peak of unemployment rates would vary from 7.7% in the most relaxed response, to 9% in the most restrictive one (Table 1 ). In all of the scenarios, however, the unemployment rates were still higher than that in the baseline scenario (had there never been a pandemic) which was around 4% after five years (in 2024). The unemployment rate is 6.2% on average over the forecast period and is 4.8% at the end of the forecast. (5.3, 7.7, 6.4, 5.5, 4.8) Border restrictions are unchanged from the main forecast, but exports of services recover more strongly. Real services exports are 4% lower at the end of the forecasting period than in the December 2019 quarter.The unemployment rate is 7.5% on average over the forecast period and is 6.6% at the end of the forecast. (5.3***, 7.7, 8.1, 7.6, 6.6) Border restrictions are partially eased on July 2021 but there is no further substantive easing. Real services exports are 35% lower at the end of the forecasting period than in the December 2019 quarter.The unemployment rate is 7.8% on average over the forecast period and is 5.8% at the end of the forecast. (5.3***, 9.0, 8.5, 7.3, 5.8) Border restrictions and real services exports are unchanged from the main forecast; however, potential output is 0.6% lower, and real GDP is 1% lower, at the end of the forecast period.* Services exports such as international education and international tourism in NZ. b. Calibration of the changes in unemployment rates due to the COVID-19 pandemic by age, sex and ethnicityIn the NZ Treasury Reports, (23, 30) projected unemployment rates were not disaggregated by age, sex and ethnicity. We therefore calibrated the projected changes in unemployment rates annually between 2020-2024, so that it could be used directly in our model as follows.We averaged the unemployment rates by ethnicity (ie, Māori and non-Māori) over 2010-2014. (31, 32) We also averaged the unemployment rates by sex and by age over 2010-2014. Of note is that these rates were for people aged 15-64 years old in NZ. We used real population by age, sex and ethnicity from Census 2013 to calibrate the unemployment rates. (33) Assumption: We assumed that the relative rate of unemployment rates by age, sex and ethnicity before the COVID-19 pandemic held. That meant that:Where U is unemployment rate, dU is the absolute change in unemployment rate, w_e is the weight of unemployment rate for Māori over non-Māori, w_s is the weight of unemployment rate for women over men, and w_a35-44 is the weight of unemployment rate for people aged 35-44 over the reference age group which is people aged 45-54 years.Algorithm: From the assumptions in equations (1) to (3), we derived the absolute changes in unemployment rates by ethnicity, sex and 10-year age group, in sequence, as follows:(4) dU_M=(dU*U_M)/(pop_M*U_M + pop_NM*U_NM) (5) dU_f=(dU*U_ f)/(pop_ f *U_f + pop_m *U_m) (6) dU_a35-44=(dU*U_ a35-44)/(pop_ a35-44 *U_ a35-44 + pop_ a45-54 *U_ a45-54 + pop_ a55-64 *U_ a55-64+ pop_ a15-24 *U_ a15-24+ pop_ a25-34 *U_ a25-34)Where pop_M is the real Māori population in 2013, pop_ a35-44 is the real population aged 35-44 years, and so on. Of note is that if any of the assumptions in equations (1)-(3) are altered, the absolute changes derived in equations (4)-(6) are changed accordingly. Furthermore, we assumed sex and age patterns (equations (5)-(6)) followed that for the general population, not by each ethnicity. This involves a slight simplification since there are minor differences in age structure by ethnicity within the studied age-groups, eg, Māori has a younger age group. But as young people have higher unemployment rates, by using the age structure for the general population, our results were conservative towards smaller changes in absolute unemployment rates.Output: The output of the calibration was absolute changes in unemployment rates (as projected by the Treasury (23, 30) ) by ethnicity (Māori/non-Māori), sex and 10-year age group (35-64 years old) for each unemployment scenario annually (2020-2024).c. Associations between unemployment and, all-cause mortality and CVD incidenceIn this study, we modeled health burdens from pandemic-induced unemployment in terms of CVD morbidity and mortality. We focused on only modeling the impact of unemployment on CVD incidence, and ignored other economic impacts arising from the reduction in real GDP.We also assumed that the effect size in CVD incidence increased linearly with an increase in unemployment rate, ie, a 2% increase in relative unemployment rate translated to 1.7% relative increase in CVD incidence rate with a RR of 1.0085. The assumption of linearity is the most parsimonious assumption -especially for these relatively small changes. But it is plausible that large increases in unemployment would have normalizing effects and perhaps reduce the impact on CVD (eg, if a large increase in unemployment triggered a disproportionate government response such as a major expansion of welfare provisions). Table 3 . (27) (28) (29) We calculated unemployment rates by age, sex and ethnicity used in the BODE 3 CVD model for each economic scenario listed in Table 1 . These were the differences in the projected unemployment rates between the pre-COVID-19 baseline and after the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic (Baseline Scenario in Table 1 ). All unemployment rates followed a lognormal distribution with an assumed 20% standard deviation (due to all health responses and economic outlooks being highly uncertain).Value Heterogeneity UncertaintyAll-cause mortality and time trendsAs per the BODE 3 CVD model. (27) (28) (29) Trends for allcause mortality were made consistent with long-run mortality trends for NZ (annual 2.25% mortality decline for Māori and 1.75% per annum for non-Māori). Trends were modeled out to 2026 (ie, for 15 years), with no subsequent decline for both ethnic groupings thereafter.By ethnicity (Māori/non-Māori), sex and ageBaseline CVD incidence/morbidity /mortality and time trendsAs per the BODE 3 CVD model. (27) (28) (29) . As per the NZ Burden of Disease Study (NZBDS) (34) we assumed a continued decline in incidence rates for both CHD and stroke of 2.0% annually, and also a 2.0% annual reduction in case fatality so that it reflects improved treatment and management.By ethnicity (Māori/non-Māori), sex and age Uncertainty: ±5% SD, log-normal distribution.Background health system costs for all citizens (adjusted for CHD and stroke costs)As per BODE 3 costing methods (35) By sex and age Uncertainty: ±10% SD, log-normal distribution.Further to four economic scenarios as mentioned above, we also modeled the following sensitivity analyses:(A) Māori CVD epidemiology parameters as per non-Māori to avoid penalizing Māori due to lower life expectancy and higher comorbidity, (B) Unemployment persists for longer (ie, 10 years), (C) No reduction in CVD trend over time (eg, on the assumption that the long-term downward trend in CVD is halted by the obesity epidemic -as seen in some highincome countries). (36) (D) Zero percent discount rate, and (E) Six percent discount rate. Table 4 shows the estimated CVD-related health loss (in HALYs) for the base case (most likely scenario) (3% discount rate for the remaining life of the NZ population alive in 2011) for various COVID-19 pandemic induced unemployment scenarios (base case, early recovery and extended border control). The health loss for the base-case was estimated at -30,300 HALYs (uncertainty interval: -66,700 to 4,100). However, only 10% of the loss (-3,010 HALYs) was accumulated in the first five years and more than 50% (-17,770 HALYs) in the 20 years in the future. The estimated CVD-related heath loss in NZ ranged from 23,300 (early recovery in export and services) to 36,900 lost HALYs (resurgence in community transmission) for the different unemployment scenarios. Of which, health loss for Māori ranged between -7,700 HALYs and -13,000, and for non-Māori from -15,700 to -26,600.For the base case (best-estimate) scenario, health inequities for Māori (Indigenous population) were 3.7 times greater than for non-Māori (49.9 vs 13.5 HALYs lost per 1000 people). Māori men suffered the most health loss per capita (95.9 HALYs per 1000 people); however, the worst inequity impacts between Māori and non-Māori were seen in women aged 45-54 years across all scenarios (six fold difference). Inequities were exacerbated much more than the sum of existing inequities in CVD burden and unemployment, ie, in some groups, the CVD burden for Māori was increased to six times higher than that of non-Māori (compared to a double unemployment rate or CVD burden). The overall pattern of inequity by ethnicity, age and sex was similar among various economic scenarios.The CVD-related health loss, inequities and health costs were similar in term of relative patterns across scenario analyses and sensitivity analyses ( Supplementary Tables 1-5 ). The equity scenario (Scenario #A), where Māori CVD epidemiology parameters were assumed to be as per non-Māori, suggested more health loss (up to -13,200 HALYs) and more inequity for Māori population (up to a ratio of Māori/non-Māori HALYs of 7.1). Unemployment persisting for 10 years (#B) suggested the most health loss (-57,100 HALYs), and 6% discount rates (#E) resulted in the smallest health loss (-18,500 HALYs).In this modeling study, we estimated the CVD-related heath loss in NZ to range from 23,300 to 36,900 HALYs for the different unemployment scenarios. For the base case (best-estimate) scenario, health inequities for Māori were 3.7 times greater. While Māori men suffered the most health loss per capita, the worst inequity impacts between Māori and non-Māori were seen in women aged 45-54 years across all scenarios (six fold difference). Inequities were exacerbated much more than the sum of existing inequities in CVD burden and unemployment, ie, in some groups, Māori's CVD burden was increased to six times higher than that of non-Māori (compared to a double unemployment rate or CVD burden). The additional health costs due to higher CVD burden were also substantial (at NZ$276m to 458m in 2011 values) for the various unemployment scenarios.Our study has several strengths as follows. First, we used a validated disease model that has been previously applied in the NZ context. Second, we followed economic scenarios projected by the NZ Treasury with valid assumptions on border controls, international tourism and education for NZ. Third, as the COVID-19 pandemic response in NZ was among the strictest (37) and one of the most successful as of December 2020, (38) our analysis reflects a pandemic related impact that is relatively independent of the direct disease impacts (ie, it reflects unemployment from the indirect impacts of the NZ response and international impacts impacting on trade). Finally, our study benefited from detailed unemployment data by age, sex and ethnicity in NZ.We did not consider that all-cause mortality and CVD mortality can also change due to behavioral changes vs supply changes (tobacco, fast food, alcohol, and physical activity level) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. We assumed that the background trend in case fatality risk before the COVID-19 pandemic still held. While it is possible that there is an effect of recessions on poorer health care delivery care (that might increase case fatality risk in those with CVD), in the absence of data we assumed no such additional impact. Also if a recession lowers the affordability of tobacco and alcohol -then there might be non-linear social contagion impacts as whole cohorts of people reduce consumption of these products in social settings (eg, going out less to bars and restaurants). But we had inadequate data on such impacts to consider these in this research. If increased unemployment-induced poverty resulted in less affordable tobacco and less expenditure on junk food (generally more expensive than home-cooked food in NZ (39) ),-then those factors would tend to reduce CVD. Finally, we ignored people aged 64+ who are in retirement age (although around 20% of this group are still in formal employment in NZ).This modeling work suggests that unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to cause significant health loss and health costs from CVD in NZ. Furthermore, this burden exacerbates the health inequities in CVD for Māori due to higher background risks of CVD, and higher unemployment rates. Prevention measures should be considered by central and local governments to reduce this risk, including job creation programs and measures directed towards CVD prevention eg, enhanced progress towards a smokefree country and reducing the hazardous processed food environment as we discuss elsewhere. (11) e. Further research work Further work could be done on modeling health inequity, health burden and health cost impacts of COVID-19-related unemployment by occupation. It may also be worth modeling unemployment interventions. Examples could be assuming that a government could implement a job creation package, such as via promoting tourism and education to international visitors and students, so that an absolute 1% of additional jobs could be created over the period 2020-2024. In addition, a modeled intervention could assume that the NZ Government could target job creation for Māori so that the absolute increases in unemployment rates of Māori were reduced to those of non-Māori. Some of these new jobs could have substantial co-benefits eg, additional tree planting on farmed hill country has benefits in terms of carbon sequestration, enhanced biodiversity, erosion prevention, flood prevention and improved water quality.To conclude, this modeling work suggests that unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to cause significant health loss, health costs and exacerbate inequities from CVD in this high-income country. Prevention measures should be considered by governments to reduce this risk, including job creation programs and measures directed towards CVD prevention (eg, enhanced progress towards a smokefree country and reducing the hazardous processed food environment).Author contribution: The study was designed by NN and NW.

Western Blot: Samples were processed as described for 143 SDS PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane with iBlot2 (ThermoFisher). After 144 transfer, membranes were washed with tris-buffered saline 0.1% Tween20 (TBST) for 145 5 min at room temperature, followed by 1 h in blocking buffer (TBST, 5% skimmed 146 milk powder). Membranes were washed three times for 5 min with TBST. MERS The relative density of this band (20.7%) permitted estimation of the proportion of the 157 FIV total protein that was Coronavirus-specific (178µg/mL). 10mg/kg). SARS-CoV-2 Victoria/01/2020 26 was prepared as described previously 24 . It 202 was delivered to ferrets by intranasal instillation (1.0mL total, 0.5mL per nostril) diluted 203 in PBS. A single dose of virus (5x10 6 pfu/ferret) was delivered to Ad-GFP-(n=4) and 204 FIV-(n=6) vaccinated ferrets. Macaques were challenged with 5 x 10 6 delivered by the 205 intratracheal route (2ml) and intranasal instillation (1ml total, 0.5ml per nostril). The 206 schedule of euthanisation and sampling is shown in Table 1 . 207 Nasal washes were obtained by flushing the nasal cavity with 2mL PBS. Throat swabs 208 were collected using a standard swab (Sigma Virocult ® ) gently stroked across the back 209 of the pharynx in the tonsillar area. Throat swabs were processed, and aliquots stored 210 in viral transport media (VTM) and AVL at ≤ -60°C until assay. Clinical signs of disease 211 were monitored as described previously 24 25 . The necropsy procedures were also as CoV-2 N ORF (accession number NC_045512.2) with quantification between 1 x 10 1 229 and 1 x 10 6 copies/µL. Positive samples detected below the limit of quantification were 230 assigned the value of 5 copies/µL, whilst undetected samples were assigned the value 231 of 2.3 copies/µL, equivalent to the assay's lower limit of detection. The severity of the histopathological lesions was scored as: 0=none (within normal 320 limits), 1=minimal, 2=mild, 3=moderate, and 4=severe. The following samples from each rhesus macaque were fixed, processed, cut and 338 stained as described above: left cranial and caudal lung lobes, trachea, larynx, 339 mediastinal lymph node, tonsil, spleen, liver, kidney, duodenum and colon. Fig. 2) . inflammatory foci within the parenchyma (Fig. 3B) . Moreover, perivascular cuffing 494 was observed frequently (Fig. 3C) , with the infiltrates being mostly mononuclear 495 cells, including CD3 + T lymphocytes identified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 496 staining (Fig. 3D) . Occasionally, neutrophils and eosinophils were also present ( Fig.   497 3C, insert). The cuffing also affected numerous airways (Fig. 3C) . Due to the small 498 numbers of animals, the differences in scores observed between FIV and Ad-GFP-499 vaccinated groups did not reach significance.In contrast, at 13-15 days pc, the lesions observed were minimal to mild with no 501 obvious differences between groups (Fig. 3A) . 502 RNAScope ISH technique was used to detect viral RNA in lung and nasal cavity tissue immune responses before SARS-CoV-2 challenge (Fig 4) . geometric mean viral RNA copies per ml (p=0.168) were measured in macaques that 539 received FIV than no vaccine controls (Fig 4C) . No significant changes in body 540 temperature (Supplementary Fig. 2C) where observed. Slight weight loss was 541 observed in both groups (Supplementary Fig. 2D ), but no adverse clinical signs were 542 recorded for any macaque despite frequent monitoring during the study period. in the total CT score in the FIV group compared to the scores attributed to macaques 559 in the unvaccinated group (Fig. 6D) . Similarly, the FIV vaccine reduced both the 560 amount of abnormalities induced (pattern score) and distribution of disease (zone 561 score) (Supplementary Fig. 4 H and I) . macaques. The total pathology score for the no vaccine group was greater than the 569 FIV group (Fig. 6B, p=0.013 ). RNAScope analysis of the percentage of area positively 570 stained for SARS-CoV-2 RNA showed a greater lung area infected in the no vaccine 571 group than FIV-vaccinated macaques (Fig. 6C, p = 0.0238) .Immune responses to FIV in rhesus macaques. Serum from control macaques 573 obtained on the day of challenge did not show any N, RBD or S-specific IgG but rises 574 in RBD and S-specific IgG were detected in serum from the FIV-vaccinated macaques 575 (Fig. 7) . FIV-vaccinated animals also showed a rise in neutralising antibody titre on the 576 day of challenge (p=0.0287). Both groups showed a rise in neutralising antibody titre 577 25 7 days following challenge (Fig. 7) . Similarly, on the day of challenge, a higher 578 frequency of spike-specific IFNγ-secreting cells was measured by ELISPOT assay in 579 the FIV group compared to that determined in the unvaccinated group suggesting the 580 induction of a modest but significant (p = 0.0433) SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular 581 response (Supplementary. Figure 3B) . The trend reversed six to eight days after 582 challenge when frequencies were assessed at the end of the study, with higher Binding curves revealed that ligands binding to formaldehyde-treated S protein gave 610 substantially lower maximum binding than that to the untreated S counterpart (Fig.   611   8A) . Area under the curve (AUC) analysis revealed that binding was significantly 612 reduced for sACE2-Fc and CR3022, and had a trend to reduction for EY6A (Fig. 8B) . 613 Interestingly, the reduction for sACE2 and CR3022 was almost precisely 2-fold, 614 suggesting either that the formaldehyde treatment had reduced the binding activity of 615 a subset of RBD domains, or that half of the formaldehyde-treated S trimers were in a 616 non-RBD available conformation. To differentiate between these two possibilities, we 617 tested binding directly to the isolated untreated or formaldehyde-treated RBD (Fig.   618   8C) . Strikingly, formaldehyde treatment had no effect on RBD-ligand binding, with 619 AUC analysis showing near identical values for formaldehyde-treated and untreated 620 RBD (Fig. 8D) . It therefore seems most likely that formaldehyde treatment is stabilising The SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Ad-GFP-or FIV-vaccinated ferrets followed a 677 similar course to that observed in our previous study 24 with peak viral RNA shedding 678 between 2 and 4 days pc. It was interesting to note that higher viral loads were The presence of inflammatory infiltrates, and particularly perivascular cuffing, has 715 been described as a feature potentially related to VED in SARS-CoV-1 preclinical 716 vaccine trials 19 21 22 . In our study these infiltrates were always of mild to moderate 717 severity. IgG was quantified by ELISA to recombinant nucleocapsid protein (NP), receptor binding domain (RBD) and full-length trimeric and stabilised spike protein (Spike).Bars are geometric mean titre. The significance of any difference from pre-to postvaccination is shown, determined by a paired t-test. The micronutralisation 50% titre (ND50) is also shown with samples obtained pre-and post-vaccination and following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Bars are geometric mean ND50 titre.
