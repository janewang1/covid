61391bd3540707c5b2b08e9233f5ad03501463fa,On the heterogeneous spread of COVID-19 in Chile,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the seventh reported coronavirus that can infect humans (Chan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) . As a consequence of the fast global spread and severe effects of the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020, resulting in 214 countries affected to date (Worldometers.info, 2020; OMS, 2020) . After eight months of living in a pandemic world and despite scientific efforts, neither a pharmaceutical treatment nor a vaccine are yet commercially available. In this scenario, non-pharmaceutical interventions as mask-wearing, social distancing, travel bans, and lockdowns have been crucial to control and to slow the pandemic spreading.From a policymaker perspective, the identification of travel and mobility patterns among regions/cities/counties in a particular country allows governments to take actions to avoid the spread of the virus. Some restrictions seem to be obvious, such as closing the countries' borders, but others as regional quarantines are not.Since the pandemic began, different epidemiological models have been proposed to evaluate and forecast the evolution of the disease. A significant part of those models derives from the renowned SIR model proposed by Kermack and McKendrick (1927) , which compartmentalizes the population exposed to the virus in the variables susceptible (S), infected (I) and Recovered (R), whose interaction determines the evolution of the disease over time. Direct extensions of the SIR model include extra compartments to represent variables of epidemiological interest, as SEIR models, differentiating exposed individuals that are not yet infectious, SIRD, differentiating deaths, and SEIRA models, considering asymptomatic carriers, among others (Gondim and Tanaka, 2020; Lalwani et al., 2020; Boujakjian, 2016; Cooper et al., 2020; Weiss, 2013; Postnikov, 2020; Dottori and Fabricius, 2014) .However, the spread of a virus depends not only on its biological characteristics but also on the behavior of the population where it propagates . Therefore, a more realistic analysis of the propagation of the disease in a heterogeneous population usually requires models that include the interaction between the different sub-populations (Hethcote and Thieme, 1985; Kong et al., 2016; Hethcote, 2009 ). These sub-populations interact dynamically with each other, and the spreading modes are not necessarily isotropic (Contreras et al., 2020d) .The case of Chile is an example of countries where typical SIR models would not work; Its geopolitical centralization isolates and scatters the different regions that behave as independent populations with varying rules of interaction (Aroca et al., 2017; Contreras et al., 2020d,a) . Besides, the profound economic inequality as reported by the Gini's index of the world bank (World Bank, 2020) among different social classes constitutes both physical and behavioral anisotropy for the spread of COVID-19. Chile has 16 regions with non-homogeneous connectivity, which is represented in the modeling by the interaction matrix (Φ), in which each module can be weighted. This matrix is not necessarily symmetric, it considers the fractions of the communities that effectively interact, and it is modified by the spreading rate (β) of each sub-population according to the restriction measures implemented by the government to every community, representing the effective interaction in a given period.In this work, we applied the multi-group SEIRD model presented by Contreras et al. (2020d) , to represent the COVID-19 spreading dynamics in Chile. By solving the inverse problem for parameter fitting, we assessed the government's actions effectiveness for controlling the outbreak, studying how parameters evolved in the different epidemiological periods. By a Monte Carlo-inspired procedure (Metropolis and Ulam, 1949) , we estimated parameter variability and provided a statistically-based forecast of the pandemic's evolution in Chile. We also present three forecast scenarios with different degrees of social distancing, which allow us to predict the effect of the various health policies implemented by the government, in consequence, better decisions by part of the authorities to prevent the spreading could be taken (Chimmula and Zhang, 2020) .The pipeline followed for the implementation of the proposed SEIRD multi-group model is detailed in Figure 1 . Official data of the spread of COVID-19 in Chile provided by local authorities (Ministry of Science, 2020) is collected and pre-processed. Initial values for the different parameters of the model are obtained from regional reports and literature. Then, the simulated annealing algorithm is used to minimize the error existing between the reported (raw) and simulated curves, obtaining a set of values for the studied parameters that represent better the observed epidemiological behavior. Finally, using these values and based on different measures of social distancing proposed, different possible scenarios are presented for active infected and deceased cases, within an established temporal horizon. In this work, we use the model proposed by Contreras et al. (2020d) to represent the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 in Chile at a county level. Assuming that natural birth and death rate of the population can be neglected when compared with the COVID-19 induced death rates -which also occur in much shorter timescales-, we chose Λ i = p i = d i = 0. The system of equations describing the dynamics is then:Susceptible individuals S i can acquire the virus after an effective contagion from an infected individual and would be moved to the exposed compartment E i . There, they would spend, on average, a time t c (latent period) until they become infectious I i . After an average time t i (infectious period), infectious individuals are moved to a final recover R i or death D i compartment. The description, initial values, and sources for all the parameters in equations from (1) to (5) are shown in Table 1 . Parameter Description Initial value Reference α Asymptomatic ratio of the population 13% -14% (Ministry of Science, 2020) ξ Factor of behavioral virulence of asymptomatics 1 (Nikolai et al., 2020) β Spreading rate of the virus in class i 0 -3 (Hu et al., 2013) Inverse of the latent period in class i 0.07 -0.25 (Lauer et al., 2020) γ Recovery rate of class i 0.03 -0.07 (Ministry of Health, 2020b) θ Pathogen induced death rate in class i 0% -2% (Ministry of Science, 2020)Raw data presented corresponds to that reported daily by the Government of Chile, available in Ministry of Science (2020). This work analyzed official data reported daily by the Government of Chile (Ministry of Health, 2020a) , consisting in a total of 244 days until November 2nd of this year.Regional-level daily data for each region i starts in March 3rd and include new daily infected cases, total infected cases, and total deaths (D i ). However, due to a reporting inconsistency generated when the official reporting guidelines changed (June 1st), datasets contained systematic errors. We corrected those errors as explained in Supplementary Section 3. Using these corrected data sets (available as supplementary dataset), we calculate total recovered (R i ) and active infected cases (I i ), defining also variables accounting for the experimental time (T exp ) and number of inhabitants per region (n hab ).For parameter fitting, we defined fifteen epidemiological periods for the pandemic progression in Chile, which limits matched relevant governmental measures detailed in The set of initial values for the parameters (Table S3 ) are expected to reflect the behavior of the different population variables (SEIRD) in the different epidemiological periods, according to the confinement measures established by the government in every region. We perform a separate parameter fitting for every epidemiological period and could be extended to a higher number of periods, if necessary.After obtaining the simulated curves for the SEIRD variables, using the values in Table S3 , we define which parameters will be estimated by the simulated annealing algorithm, before proceeding to the formal parameter fitting. We considered the percentage of asymptomatic patients to be constant across regions, based on governmental reports (Ministry of Health, 2020a) . Recovery and exposure rates are considered uniform at the country level as the Chilean health system have not been overwhelmed to date. Therefore, we obtain in the parameter fitting the local spreading and death rates (β i and θ i respectively). We also provide freedom to the initial conditions, leaving them to be adjusted too in the parameter fitting procedure.For every parameter combination evaluated throughout the fitting process, we numerically obtain the solution of the SEIRD model (equations (1)- (5)). Subsequently, we quantify a measure proportional to the mean squared error (MSE) between simulated curves and raw data reported for each region, combined in the cost functional J being minimized. The optimization algorithm selected was simulated annealing.Finally, the initial guess for initial condition of the SEIRD variables in each region was defined as follows: the initial value for the number of susceptible (S i (0)) people is considered as the total populationS Maule (0) = n hab − 1 because in this region the first case was reported.We summarize the interaction structure between the different sub-populations considered in the SEIRD model in a connection matrix (Φ). In that matrix, entries (Φ) i,j represent the fraction of individuals from the ith sub-population that moves to the jth. Note that Φ is not necessarily symmetric, as the fluxes may be different. Therefore, (Φ) i,j = (Φ) j,i In our model, Φ is also modulated by the local spreading rates β i , thereby including governmental restrictions valid in the different periods considered.For each region i, we estimated (Φ) i,j as the fraction of individuals over fifteen from i temporally moving to j because of work or studies.For the construction of this matrix, we collected data from national accounts of the National Statistics Based on this, the displacement matrix Φ comprises factors e i and C ij . The value e i represents the fraction of the population that leaves the region, defined as the number people of population i that travels to another region divided by its total population n hab,i :For each region i, we estimated (Φ) ij as the fraction of individuals over fifteen from i temporally moving to j because of work or studies, C ij , multiplied by the effective population leaving region i.Given the geographical characteristics of Chile and its centralization, Regions do not have the same level of displacement between them (Table S2) .The implementation of the mathematical model and resolution of the parameter-fitting inverse problem was performed in Matlab version R2018a.We determined the set of parameter that best describes the different regions for each epidemiological period by minimizing a cost functional J. This functional is, in principle, proportional to the mean square error between simulated curves and raw data. This functional J represent the accumulated difference between the number of Inf ected, Deaths, and Recovered cases (using the established initial parameters Table S3) , and the corresponding extracted from the raw data in the official repositories in each region.Because of difference in magnitudes in the number of inhabitants across regions, it is expected that the error contributed by a small region will be less than that contributed by a large region. To avoid unrealistic solutions where small regions would be left aside because of the algorithm's blind drive to minimize the error, we included a weighting factor. Each region was weighted by a factor directly proportional to the ratio between its number of inhabitants and the number of infected, recovered and deceased respectively, whose exponent was empirically set at 1.7, because using this exponent-value errors of similar orders were reported for both large and small regions, and hence similar priorities in adjustments.The weighting factor w X connects the different contributions in functional X, and has a default value of w X = 1.To obtain reliable values for the selected parameters, Monte Carlo simulations (Metropolis and Ulam, 1949) were performed according to the methodology described in Contreras et al. (2020c) (N = 100) . The inverse problem for curve-fitting is solved individually, resulting in distributions of parameters. We statistically obtained average population parameters and their variability from those distributions.Once obtaining values for both parameters and their uncertainty, we evaluate different forecast scenarios for the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic Chile.As a result of Monte Carlo multiple-simulations experiment performed we obtained distributions for both β i and θ i parameters in each region, and subsequently used them to numerically solve our model. Here we focus on active infected cases (I) and total deaths (D), since these we believe are they of greater importance for the decision-making process.Tables 3 The NPI (non-pharmaceutical interventions) agenda of the government was different for each region, and the main criterion for enacting them was the reported new cases. We observe that the spreading rate β remained high in some regions during the first epidemiological periods before decreasing, due to the time required for seeing the effects of lockdowns and delays associated with the disease progression. In those regions reporting the first COVID-19 cases in Chile, the spreading rate β decreased faster because of the earlier establishment of restrictive measures. An example is the O'Higgins Region, which has the lowest average value for the fifteen epidemiological periods of spreading rate. Regarding the fatality rate θ, it remains relatively low in all regions since the hospital capacity at the country level for the correct care of critical patients was not exceeded, and to the efficiency in the inter-regional transfers of these patients.. Using the different sets of parameters obtained in the Monte Carlo experiment, the simulated curves for the active infected cases (I) and deaths cases (D) are projected in each region over time with a two-level calculated confidence interval (60% and 95%). Figure 2 shows both the simulations and raw data for the Metropolitan, Valparaíso and Bío-Bío Regions.We observe that simulated curves are in good agreement with raw data, which always remain within the confidence intervals and present consistent trends. The color intensity of these zones varies depending on the confidence intervals percentage (95% and 60%, light and dark shadows, respectively), calculated from the β and θ distributions obtained in the Monte Carlo experiment.In the Metropolitan Region, a peak of active cases is observed between June and July, which corresponds and Bío-Bío (E,F) Regions, along with 60% and 95% confidence intervals. Raw data for the evaluated time-frame is also presented (grey dots).to an increase in the number of deaths cases on the same date. The raw data for the active infected cases in the Valparaíso and Bío-Bío Regions has two peaks. The first one corresponds to the date where active cases in the Metropolitan Region were at their peak, so due to the high number of transfers between these regions, these active cases act as vectors of infection in the destination regions, thus increasing infected cases and therefore deceased. In contrast, the second one is related to the fact that the measures adopted by the government are sectorized for each Region. For Valparaíso and Bío-Bío Regions, the isolation measures were relaxed before than for the Metropolitan Region, resulting in a second increase rate of the active infected cases.In the sixteen analyzed regions, the raw data for active infected and death cases are not always consistent with the calculated median. However, it remains in narrow confidence intervals (Figure 1 to Figure 13 , Supplementary), which is probably due to the number of days in the defined epidemiological periods.Epidemiological periods of 15 days can capture the dynamic functioning in the regions of high and low population, that is, it adapts to the number of inhabitants. However, when an abrupt change in the behavior of the population occurs within a period, generating inflexion points in the curves of active infected, the correct adjustment of the simulated curves becomes more difficult. This could be solved by further reducing the number of days per period but risking the possibility of overfitting to raw data. The proposed SEIRD model was able to adjust well to the data in both low-population and heavily populated regions, showing the relevance in the 1.7 factor described in the parameter fitting strategy section.Higher values for this adjustment factor result in a better adjustment in the small regions, but at the cost of a less rigorous adjustment in the larger regions. In contrast, with values lower than 1.7, the opposite occurs. Furthermore, it is crucial to consider the actual spreading dynamics between geographical Regions to represent more appropriately the scenario in each Region.The Effective Reproduction Number R t represents the number of persons a single infected individual might infect, in a population that is aware of the disease representing the viral spread rate of the virus, and varies depending on the policies implemented by the government, such as quarantines (Perasso, 2018) .Based on the parameters obtained from the simulations, it is possible to calculate the value of R t as the ratio between the spreading rate β and the recovery plus deaths rate (γ + θ), as demonstrated in Cintrón-Arias et al. (2009) . This approach allows us to obtain the effective reproduction number driven only by the local population's behavior, decoupled from other regions:We obtain a data-driven value for the observed R t , R obs t , adapting the methodology presented in Contreras et al. (2020e) :In particular, both values do not necessarily need a match, as they represent -slightly-different quantities.The observed R obs t represents whether the overall trend is the spread or containment of the disease, purely driven by data, and is affected by testing and tracing governmental plans (Contreras et al., 2020b) . More extensive testing will uncover unnoticed infection chains, and also increase the numbers as the uncovering would be faster than the spread of the disease. On the other hand, the effective reproduction number R t accounts for local trends on contagion, disregarding whether those cases would be noticed or remain uncovered throughout the disease timeline.In Figure 3 the R t values obtained from official sources and simulation results in the Metropolitan, Valparaíso, and Bío-Bío Regions are presented, in conjunction with an 80% confidence interval. As is shown, both R t values reflect a similar behavior. However, they are not identical, probably because there is a difference between the simulated and raw data due to the contribution of the inter-region movements in the infection rate, which agrees with the results obtained in the inverse problem-solving.These results for R t show the correlation between the imposed social distancing measures and the values of the Effective Reproduction Number, in the different regions. This value is higher in the III epidemiological period for the three presented regions and subsequently decreases as more restrictive measures are declared. consequently a second outbreak of infected assets, more significant than the first one.Projecting these R t values into the future, a decrease in the virus spreading rate and a reduction of the number of active infected would be expected, since a R t < 1 implies a slow rate of spread and the outbreak size would decay exponentially.To evaluate the impact of governmental interventions, we simulated different scenarios aiming to project the contagion trends observed if those interventions did not take place. In Figure 4 , we present projections of infected cases in the Metropolitan Region, if no more restrictions were imposed after the II and III epidemiological periods.Due to the importance of establishing containment measures as soon as possible to avoid an excessive spread of the virus, the first three epidemiological periods were chosen to evaluate immediate quarantine (I) and non-imposition of measures (II and III) scenarios.It is observed that in the scenario I the number of active infected cases reaches a peak of approximately 1500 (Figure 4 , C) cases, 30 days after the first reported case. The spreading rate (β) associated with this scenario corresponds to 0.01, registered in the VII epidemiological period in which the metropolitan region was in total quarantine. On the other hand, in scenarios II and III active infections peak over a million cases between days 150 -200 (Figure 4, B) . Scenario III the one that presents a higher number of infections due mainly to two factors: The number of active infected cases at the beginning of the period and the spreading rate. In both factors, the values are higher in the third period than in the second. In addition to the spreading rate (β) in the third period being 0.12, while in the second period it is 0.05, a higher initial 2. Transition: People is allowed to leave the house with restrictions, only on weekdays.3. Preparation: Individuals are free to move, but group gatherings are not permitted.4. Initial Opening: Group gatherings are permitted, with a restricted number of people.Opening: free group gatherings are permitted.Each region that enters a new stage of the plan presents greater freedom of movement and therefore, the number of contacts between people β could increase. Consequently, a weighting factor is assigned to each stage of the plan. This factor multiplies the β value of the corresponding region to projecting the effects that the ""Step byStep"" program will have on the extrapolation in the SEIRD variables (Table S8) • Scenario 1: The Metropolitan Region remain in stage 1 of quarantine.• Scenario 2: Current scenario. The Metropolitan Region advances to 4th phase of preparation.• Scenario 3: Limit scenario, in which the spreading rate β increases to such an extent that large outbreaks and the second wave of massive infections occur. Based on the projections, we would expect a sustained decrease in case numbers if the quarantined regime continues. However, in the current scenario (initial opening phase), a second peak in contagion is expected.Nevertheless, this wave would be lower in magnitude compared with the one observed in the first half of 2020, and therefore the health system would also be able to handle it. Finally, in the third scenario (where a massive opening is proposed), we observe an uncontrolled increase in case numbers, vastly exceeding the number of infections observed at the beginning of the pandemic. In this scenario, it would be uncertain to predict occupancy levels of ICU beds in hospitals as well as requests for mechanical respirators. However, we would expect a saturation of the public health system.COVID-19 spreading depends on multiple factors, including the biological/epidemiological aspects of SARS-CoV-2, human behavior, governmental measures, and characteristics of the affected population. Several research groups have statistically analyzed these factors during pandemic progression, and we carefully included them in our modelling. The multi-group SEIRD model used considers the heterogeneous distribution, and dynamic displacement of the Chilean population, grouped in 16 regions, according to the geographical distribution, and also a temporal progression of the taken governmental measures.Following the presented results, our model shows to be efficient to the adjustment of the raw data, overcoming challenges as discontinuities and high variability in it, generating simulations that are easy to interpret and project. The measures imposed for a particular region can affect other regions, to a greater or lesser extent depending on their interaction, thus highlighting the need for coordinated governmental actions to control the spread of COVID-19. We have shown that the multi-group SEIRD model presented in this work is a useful tool to represent the contribution of each region in a heterogeneously populated country and is helpful to forecast in the short term the evolution of the different population groups.",Chile,abstract,2020-12-03,12
c2a86b42d97e3c8393c7f210ba89be19e971c644,Optimising SARS-CoV-2 pooled testing strategies on social networks for low-resource settings,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has upended the world, quickly challenging settled assumptions and certainties. It is a new virus with an extraordinary efficiency in transmitting from person to person and a rather high level of morbidity and mortality that raises with age and co-morbidities. The non-pharmaceutical intervention of detection and isolation of infected people is a key policy to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The aim is to slow transmission and the growth rate of infections to avoid overburdening healthcare systems an approach widely known as flattening the curve. In order to identify the infected people SARS-CoV-2 tests must be performed.However, each diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 test costs 30-50 US dollars [2] . Therefore, testing many people in a population regularly, as may be essential to flatten the curve, is beyond the reach of most low and even some mid-income countries. However, there are more efficient ways than the naive approach of testing everyone in which far fewer tests are actually needed, especially at low prevalence. It is much more efficient to pool (or combine) samples and test them together. Group testing initially appears in a paper of Dorfman in 1943 [3] . Other algorithms of pooling samples have been proposed recently [1, 4, 5, 6, 7] . Estimating the prevalence of a virus within a community prior to widespread disease transmission may help public health officials predict when to prepare for an increase in cases. With over sixty eight million cases in the world at time of writing this paper [8] , this sort of screening strategy is probably not necessary at this point in the pandemic. Nevertheless, these techniques are likely to be valuable at the beginning of a future outbreak to track the spread of a virus across the world over time. Specially because human behaviors that perturb the human-microbial status quo may have reached a tipping point that predicts the inevitability of an acceleration of disease emergences [9] .On the other hand, this approach may be particularly helpful in settings where the number of infections is low and declining, and most test results are expected to be negative. For example, in a community where the infection seems to be under control and reopenings of schools and businesses are planned, pooled testing of employees and students could be an effective strategy.Our goal in this work is to analyze the way in which different strategies of surveillance testing in a low prevalence stage, like frequency and random vs. localized search of infected people, change the epidemics curve. We choose the hypercube algorithm of pool testing [1] in the same way as we may have chosen some other pool testing algorithm because we are not particularly interested in the efficiency of the algorithm but in the strategy of the algorithm application. A similar study to monitor whether epidemics were contained or became uncontrolled depending on the frequency of testing was studied with a stochastic agent-based model for SARS-CoV2 transmission [10] . To investigate the effects of surveillance testing strategies at the population level, we used simulations to monitor whether epidemics were contained or became uncontrolled, We will take a network approach to simulate the evolution of the epidemic on a society in order to study not just the frequency but also the spatial distribution of testing. In order to study the different behavior of the epidemic when different test pooling samples are applied the social group under the epidemic is represented as families or small communities that interact with each other in a random way. We choose a sparse network to reflect the lockdown restriction. Similar structures have been proposed in [11] for carrying out comparative tests of different methods for community detection in complex networks.The paper is laid out as follows. In section 2 we define the epidemiological network model in which the connections between individuals are modeled as static links [12, 13] , assuming the contagion as a process faster than the network evolution. The main results are presented in section 3. In section 3.1, the impact of the social structure given by the network model on the spread of the disease is analyzed. This allow us to establish a frame of reference to study, in section 3.2, the optimal strategies of the pool testing based on the geometry of a hypercube, at low prevalence [1] . Finally, in section 4, we state our conclusions.In our sparse network model, we assume that the small communities (families) are composed of a few members connected to each other and also to other families with a number of external static links triggering the spreading epidemics (see figure 1 ). The number of members of each small community or family is k int ± ∆k int nodes connected in average to k ext nodes that belong to other small communities. The nodes of the network represent individuals that can be either susceptible, infected or recovered, subject to interactions with their neighbors (i.e. other individuals directly linked to him/her by either intracommunity or intercommunity connections). As a result of these interactions, susceptible individuals can become infected and spread the disease over time before they recover or isolate using a strategy in affected areas by the virus based on the geometry of a hypercube. Starting with a number of outbreaks of the disease randomly located on the network, the model dynamics is defined by iterating a sequence of possibilities, as follows:(1) an individual is selected at random; (2a) if the individual is infected, he/she can transmit the virus to his/her neighbors with an infectious contact rate of COVID-19 pandemic β or can recover with probability 1/t rec , with t rec the recovery time. This time is different for each infected individual, given by a Gaussian distribution around the mean value t rec (see Table 1 ).(2b) if the individual has infected neighbors, he/she can become infected with an effective contact rate β.(3) with probability 1/t lif e , the selected individual can die, where t lif e is the average life expectancy. For simplicity without loss of generality, if he/she dies, an individual is born in his/her place without intercommunity connections. [16] ; b 95 % confidence interval to obtain t rec = mean latent period + mean infectious period = 2.2-6 + 4-14 days = 6.2-20 days [16] . c Since N is always greater than M , we consider appropriate to set N one order of magnitude higher than M . d range for most countries in Latin America [17] .We consider that the infectious contact rate β is constant over time but may change with different pairs of neighbors according to a Gaussian distribution around its mean value β (see table 1 ). Indeed, each individual experiences a different number of contacts per unit time with their neighbors, proportionally reflected in β. In other words, β grows with the probability of disease transmission per unit time and also with the interactions between neighbors [18, 19] .The system evolves towards absorbing states with a maximum of affected individuals by the pandemic i.e., frozen configurations that are not capable of further changes. The final state, consisting of recovered and susceptible individuals that were not infected depends on the number of outbreaks of the disease and on the community structure. We are interested in studying the efficiency of a search and isolation algorithm based on the geometry of a hypercube of infected individuals on affected areas applied to the model of social networks under quarantine. The affected areas are discovered due to the rate of infected individuals report to health centres.In order to set the stage for the investigation of testing effects, let us first show results concerning social network model under quarantine without any epidemic control. As mentioned above, in the absence of testing, the system reaches a total number of infected individuals that depends on the parameter values of the disease and the number of outbreaks at the beginning. These outbreaks are randomly located on the networks. . Mean densities defined as mean numbers of recovered (green lines), active infected (red lines) and susceptible exposed to the virus (black lines) individuals divided by the total population (100,000 inhabitants), without epidemic control, obtained from social networks under quarantine consisting of k int = 4 ± 2 cohabitants and of k ext = 4 mean intercommunity connections and different outbreaks: 1, 10 and 100 outbreaks of the virus (solid, dashed and dotted lines, respectively). The curves were averaged over 100 simulation runs. Figure 2 shows the mean densities defined as mean numbers of individuals recovered (green lines), active infected (red lines) and susceptible exposed to the virus (black lines) divided by the total population of 100,000 inhabitants, obtained for 1, 10 and 100 outbreaks of the virus (solid, dashed and dotted lines, respectively). The exposed susceptible individuals are defined as those persons having at least one infected neighbor. For a given number of outbreaks, the mean density curve of these individuals (black lines) reaches its maximum long before the corresponding infected people peak (red lines in the same figure) . The mean density of susceptible individuals exposed to the virus could be clearly a measure to estimate the probability of contagion. Also, figure 2 shows that infectiousness increases as the number of outbreaks per inhabitant increases and the epidemic peak is earlier. This last result is expected and also predicted by mean field models like Verhulst-Pearle sigmoid [20] or SIR [21] . Such compartmental models have proven flexible, tractable, and highly informative as a general guide to the population-level behavior of diseases. Each compartment has either susceptible, infected or recovered persons and the probability of disease-causing contact with any member of a particular compartment is the same. This mean field approximation leads to a fixed intensity of the infection peak i.e., it does not change with the density of outbreaks under 10% as shown in figure 3(a) . Moreover, these results are easily collapsed by a simple translation on the horizontal axis. In figure 3(b) , we moved the curves of 10 and 100 outbreaks on the curve of the 1 outbreak, estimating an initial pandemic growth as a geometric progression of common ratioThus, the translation on the horizontal axis is nT ′ = n/r, with n = 0, 1, 2for 1, 10 and 100 outbreaks, respectively. The good collapse of the curves is apparent, though a slight difference in the densities of individuals recovered is found at the beginning of their collapse due to every curve starts without individuals recovered (this difference is not visualized in the scale of figure 3(b) ). Therefore, for the SIR model, if the density of outbreaks is low enough and known, the pandemic is predictable over time and it is useless for our goal of studying different searching and testing strategies. On the other hand, our network model shows a different behavior. The height of the epidemic peak is associated to the network social connectivity. Indeed, a few outbreaks can become extinct without intervention, in areas with few connections and thus, the intensity of the infection peak is low. Epidemic elimination may also be obtained for a higher number of outbreaks when the network connectivity is reduced. This may be clearly observed in figure 4 , where the evolution of mean densities of recovered, active infected and susceptible exposed to the virus individuals for two different social structures and a fixed number of outbreaks are shown. The enhancement of connectivity in the network promotes the spread of the disease. Therefore, the social isolation is an effective tool that delays the epidemic peak and also significantly reduces the total number of infected individuals, reflected in the number of recovered individuals (green lines of figure 4 ). Since the social isolation has its socio-cultural and economic constraints, in the next section, we will apply the algorithm based on the geometry of a hypercube to search and reduce the infection in affected areas of social networks under quarantine.The first tests start when a number n I0 of infected individuals report to health centres. Each of these persons is considered an infection source and a scanning of their neighbors is done until completing N/n I0 individuals around of each infection source, with N the total number of screened persons per day. Once the sample is taken, the testing method is applied. This method has been introduced in [1] and the idea is to pool N S subsamples of the total sample N and test the combined subsample with a single test. If the test is negative all subjects in the subsample are negative and it continues with another subsample of N S persons. If the test is positive the hypercube algorithm is applied to determine who are infected.The algorithm consists of locating each individual of the positive subsample on a D-dimensional hypercube lattice with L points in each direction. The hypercube has D principal directions, containing the N S individuals of the positive subsample, so that L D = N S . For example, for D = 3 and L = 3, the hypercube is a simple cube with 27 individuals arranged on a 3 × 3 × 3 grid (figure 5). Each slice of the hypercube is tested and if is positive the algorithm is running again for the positive slices properly selected to find the infected persons (see [1] for more details of the method). In short, the algorithm is based on the idea that a slice through a D-dimensional hypercube is itself a hypercube of dimension D − 1. The effective size N S of the subgroups is chosen to minimize the total mean number of tests per person. The testing increases as the number of infected individuals increases in the subgroup. Therefore, the algorithm is effective if this number is low and if tests with high sensitivity are used for the dilution of the subsamples, such as reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests [22, 23] . Assuming Poisson statistics for the number of infected individuals in the subgroups and using L = 3 points in each direction of the hypercube, the optimal size to minimize the total number of tests is [1] N S ≃ 0.350/p,with p the prevalence defined as the probability that any individual of the subgroup N S is infected. The prevalence of the disease is unknown and we roughly estimate p ≈ n I0 /N in the affected areas by the virus, considering that infection does not spread at the beginning of the pandemic. Then, when the testing is finalized, infected individuals in affected areas are found and isolated of their neighbors. Due to limited resources, a maximum number of tests per day M is imposed. M is chosen lower than the sample N of screened individuals per day. The testing is recursively repeated, estimating p as the number of infected individuals isolated, divided by the samples used in the previous testing. In our network model simulations, a fixed number of 15 % of infected persons report to health centres in each round of testing. The first tests start when the 15 % of infected individuals is equal or greater than one and thus, n I0 depends on the sample. Figure 6 (a) shows the density of active infected and recovered individuals for a social network without epidemic control and with testing using the hypercube algorithm and the simple method of one test per person on affected areas. For both methods of epidemic control, an epidemic decrease is obtained, significantly improving for social structures with less interaction ( figure 6(b) ). In this case, the hypercube algorithm achieves control the epidemic. In fact, the density of recovered persons (dashed green line in figure 6 (b)) is very low since a few individuals were infected (dashed red line, practically is not visualized in the scale of figure 6(b) ).Time saving is very important for a rapidly spreading infectious disease like COVID-19. However, the regular testing is limited by costs and operational capacity of sampling. In figures 6 (a)-(c), a maximum number of tests M = 200 on a maximum number of screened individuals N = 2000 for every 100,000 inhabitants per day were considered, but in part (c) the maximum number of tests and of screened persons are M/2 and N/2 every 12 hours, doubling the frequency of testing. This allows the search and isolation of infected individuals in a shorter time and thus, can not infect others. Figure 6 (c) shows that the hypercube algorithm achieves control of epidemic reducing the search time for social networks with high connectivity.The efficiency of the hypercube algorithm depends on the samples taken from infected individuals report to health centres. If the search of infected individuals is random, the efficiency of the algorithm is low. To check this, we take M persons at random on the network and build hypercubes. Infection curves do not practically change with a random search to both high and low connectivity networks. The search on affected areas is essential to consistently reduce an epidemic like COVID-19. These results are summarized in figure 7 , in which the efficiency of the hypercube algorithm (a) and the simple method of testing every person (b) as a function of the maximum number of tests per day and of frequency of isolation of infected persons is shown, for social networks with high connectivity. The efficiency is defined as the difference between the total number of recovered individuals without epidemic control and with epidemic control divided by the total number of recovered individuals without epidemic control. The maximum number of scanned individuals is ten times the maximum number of tests. The frequency is number of times that infected persons are isolated per day respecting the maximum numbers of tests and scanned individuals (see figure 6 (c)). The efficiency depends on the model of social networks, however the results shown in figure 7 are qualitatively useful. The frequency of search and isolation of infected individuals on zones reported with virus is the relevant parameter to control the COVID-19. Indeed, a remarkable increment of the algorithm's efficiency is observed when the frequency increases in comparison to an increase of the maximum number of tests per day. The social, psychological and economic burdens throughout a pandemic lead to a minimum threshold of interactions between persons originating a certain confined social structure. We found that social networks with low connectivity between their individuals reduce the contagion and can go a long way in keeping the curves of infected persons flat. However, since most facets of economic and social life require person-to-person contact, the testing, searching and isolating infected individuals helps to reduce the epidemics and return sooner to normal activity. RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) tests are accurate, but costly and are a challenge particularly for developing countries. The search for infected individuals by grouping samples is considered in this work. Particularly, we studied the epidemic evolution under different strategies of application of a pool testing based on the geometry of a hypercube to isolate infected persons applied to social networks under quarantine threatened by an epidemic with high contagiousness and rapid spread as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The pool testing on social networks under quarantine is effective if the search of infected persons is in zones where the virus was reported and the isolation of these individuals is done as quickly as possible. The strategic search in affected zones by the virus and a high frequency of isolation can overcome a massive testing. Indeed, we found that a massive testing randomly applied to social networks with both high and low connectivities leads to little impact on reduction of contagion.",Argentina,first author,2020-12-31,12
f731dcc951abbde0ce0fbd1fdf4f2fb25defacf2,Neural language models for text classification in evidence-based medicine,"Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is a medical practice that aims to find all the evidence to support medical decisions. This evidence nowadays is obtained from biomedical journals, usually accessible through online databases like PubMed [5] and EMBASE [4] , which provide free access to articles' abstracts and in some cases, to full articles. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, EBM is critical to making decisions at the individual level and public health since research articles address topics like treatments, adverse cases, and effects of public policies in medicine. The EBM foundation Epistemonikos has made essential contributions by curating and publishing updated guides of what treatments are working and not against COVID-19 1 . Epistemonikos addresses EBM by a combination of software tools for data collection, storage, filtering [2, 1] , and retrieval, as well as by the vital labor of volunteer physicians who curate and label research articles based on quality (to include in the database), type (systematic review, randomized trial, among others) and PICO labels (patient, intervention, comparison, outcome). However, this workflow has been challenged during 2020 by increasing growth and rapidly evolving evidence of COVID-19 articles published in the latest months. Moreover, to ensure the rapid collection of the latest evidence published, pre-print repositories such as medRXiv and bioRXiv have been added to the traditional online databases. In order to support Epistemonikos' effort to filter and curate the flood of articles related to COVID-19, we present the results of an applied AI project where we implement and evaluate a text classification system to filter and categorize research articles related to COVID-19. The current model, based on Random Forests, has an acceptable performance classifying systematic reviews (SR) but fails on classifying other document categories. In this article, we show how using BioBERT yields marginal improvements, while XLNET results in significant progress with the best performance. These results save a considerable amount of time from volunteer physicians by pre-filtering the articles worth of manual curation and labeling for EBM. In average, a physician takes two minutes in reviewing one article, while the system we present in this article can review up to 32, 000 within one hour.Methods and data. We compare document classification results among a (i) random forest with a customized tokenizer made by Epistemonikos, (ii) an XLNET [8] language model representing documents using a linear layer as a classifier, and (iii) the same setting with a BioBERT [3] language model. The documents' classification can be a systematic review, a primary study using a randomized controlled trial, non-randomized primary study, broad synthesis, and excluded document. The distribution of documents can be observed in the second column of Table 1 . Notice that the type of document partially explains the classification models' mistakes: broad synthesis and systematic review are both kinds of surveys, while primary studies (rct and non-rct) deal with specific treatments and populations. Excluded can be of any of the other four classes, but they are not included in the official Epistemonikos dataset due to their low quality.Results. Table 1 shows the performance of each model in terms of precision (Prec.), recall (Rec.), and F1-score (F-1) for every type of document. In general terms, we observe that XLNet obtains the top F-1 score for any document category, in some cases by a small margin, such as under systematic review (F-1=.97), and in other cases by a large margin, as in the classes Broad synthesis (F-1=.61), and Excluded (F-1=.78). The results indicate that the random forest and BioBERT with a linear layer have a bias towards the most dominant class, Systematic review, reporting slightly better recall (Rec.=.99 and Rec.=1.0) than XLNet (Rec.=.98) in this particular type of document. However, XLNet is better than the other two models in terms of Precision upon all classes, with the only exception of Broad synthesis, where random forest (Prec.=.75) performs better than XLNet (Prec.=.67). However, XLNet recall outperforms (Rec.=.56) random forest (Rec.=.15). It is important to note that when using the random forest implemented for Epistemonikos, a new tokenizer has to be made depending on the document categories. In the case of XLNET, it is more versatile because it is enough to train embeddings and classify them regardless of the document category. In the case of BioBERT, which has a similar operation, it does not yield consistent performance for the minority classes Broad synthesis and Excluded. In this study, we have compared three methods, one of which is currently in production at the Epistemonikos foundation, the random forest. The others are BioBERT, which, although it is based on the transformer architecture, does not achieve the results shown by XLNET. Having such reliable results means a big impact in times of the COVID-19 pandemic where there is an exponential growth of available literature. In future work we will incorporate explanations obtained from transformer attention mechanisms, compare them against other explanation methods like LIME [7] or SHAP [6] , and conduct a user study to assess whether physicians' work is facilitated by this feature.This work seeks to decrease manual effort in the practice of evidence-based medicine, allowing physicians to distinguish relevant documents for clinical questions. Implementing the method with the largest performance in our offline evaluation (XLNet) in production might imply an increased cost in terms of GPU needs for Epistemonikos, which is not under their current infrastructure. Adding more documents might also imply additional fine-tuning of the model, incurring in larger costs. Another aspect not addressed in this research is that of fairness: is the current model performing better to classify certain populations being treated (e.g. white males) compared to black females? we should address this aspect actively to prevent our model from learning undesired biases already seen in several applications.",Chile,first author,2020-12-01,12
9bd37ae3bf7f5f567b0cd3c37b55da0600b22426,COVID-19 EMOTION MONITORING AS A TOOL TO INCREASE PREPAREDNESS FOR DISEASE OUTBREAKS IN DEVELOPING REGIONS,"As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, by April 2020, more than a fifth of the world's population had already been under some kind of lock-down [2] . This type of measure places a burden on mental health; specially, among those who experienced isolation or quarantine [3] . In addition, the economic impact caused by the pandemic on developing regions produced a decline on the number of people that could cover their basic needs. Such situation triggered strong emotional responses; ecpecially, among vulnerable populations [10] .Mental health conditions -such as anxiety and depression-have been correlated with basic emotions [8] . Emotions are biological states associated with thoughts, feelings, behavioural responses, and a degree of pleasure or displeasure. One of the most used frameworks to categorize emotions is Ekman's framework [1] . According to Ekman, there are six basic emotions: sadness, happiness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust.Since emotions are correlated with mental health conditions, it is crucial for health authorities and private healthinsurance companies to understand how the people's emotions change according to the different lock-down policies implemented during a disease outbreak. To help health authorities, in this task, we want to answer the following arXiv:2012.12184v1 [cs.CL] 17 Dec 2020 question: How can we monitor people's emotions, related to a disease outbreak, to increase preparedness in developing regions, without posing risks to human rights nor perpetuating inequalities?There have been some studies on emotion-monitoring of disease outbreaks. Osherenko implemented lexical-affect sensing, showing the relation of emotions with events that took place in Australia, in 2009 [7] . Recently, Wei et al., gathered a set of 1,690 questions about COVID-19. To classify such questions into 15 categories, using a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) which scored 58.1% accuracy [11] . To understand emotional responses to lock-downs, Kleiberg et al. asked participants to indicate their emotions and express them in short or long texts [5] . They also found that by using a predictive model, it was possible to approximate the emotional responses of participants, from text, within 14% of their actual value. In another work, Wolohan used a deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with fastText embeddings to predict population rates of depression, on Reddit, in order to estimate the effect of COVID-19 on mental health [12] . Finally, Kruspe et al. analyzed Twitter messages (tweets), collected during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, in Europe, regarding their sentiment [6] . Kruspe et al. implemented a neural network for sentiment analysis using multilingual-sentence embeddings.There are two limitations with previous studies in the context of developing regions. First, most of these depend on data and models that only work for the English language. Second, even tough there was a study that considered several languages [6] , European people may write tweets differently from people in developing regions such as Latin America. For instance, European tweet semantics may be largely based on emoticons and hashtags, which may not be the case in Latin America, and, furthermore, jargon and slang are significantly different.In this paper, we present a system that continuously access tweets -massively and anonymously-from accounts in main cities of Colombia, as well as politicians and health-authorities Twitter accounts. The system uses big-data tools such as Apache Spark and a public cloud (Amazon Web Services [AWS]) to train and deploy a BERT (a state-of-the-art model) that monitors emotions to increase preparedness for disease outbreaks.Twitter is a social network with an enormous amount of public data that can be used to detect specific information of a large sample of the population. Furthermore, information downloaded from Twitter's free application programming interface (API) allows it to capture a large sample of tweets produced in a specific location, while protecting personal information such as gender, race and age, thus the emotion-monitor system does not perpetuate inequalities nor targets specific population groups.We present methodology in Section 2 and results in Section 3. Finally, we present some conclusions and future work in Section 4.In this section, we present first data acquisition, pre-processing and training. After, we present model validation.Fine tuning [4] and transfer learning [9] have proven useful to built state-of-the-art models in natural language processing. Nevertheless, the scarcity of labeled data in Spanish was a problem. To overcome the dearth of labeled data, we decided to build our own dataset using Twitter free API and AWS serverless-compute platform Lambda. We collected more than 250 Gigabytes of tweets from Colombian principal cities and related accounts, on a time window of one month. All tweets were labeled using specific words (known as lexicons) related with each emotion, proposed by Osherenko [7] .The tweets were pre-processed removing accentuations and special characters -except for exclamation and question marks. Finally, we removed the lexicons used to label the tweets and a we used BERT tokenizer. As twitter restricts long texts, the longest text, contained 65 tokens, so we used this size as the maximum-length parameter. Tweets were also filtered by considering only those that contains words related to COVID-19 such as coronavirus, epidemics, lock-down, among others.For training the BETO model, we used a weighted binary cross-entropy loss function, during four epochs, saving a checkpoint on each epoch, to compare the results and use the model with the best results. The optimizer used was adam with 3 × 10 −5 as learning rate.Using a Google-App script, we made a survey to create a validation dataset to evaluate our model. The web interface showed a random tweet and the user could select one, more than one or no emotions related to the tweet. The users were mainly senior students of Psychology. The selection was saved automatically on a Google spreadsheet. A label was saved only when two or more people agreed on it. Finally, we used the labels from the survey to validate the models. The labeled data can be accessed at https://rb.gy/czggi6. To evaluate the model, we considered mean average precision (map), hamming loss and mean F1 score as validation metrics. Hamming loss was used to get an overall result of all predictions, but class weights becomes really important in this problem because there's a lot of joy or sadness tweets but very little that reflect disgust, so f1 and map were evaluated also. We performed four validation experiments as follows:1. The BETO model, with the same pre-process as the training data, but removing the lexicons.2. Checking for lexicons associated to an emotion in the tweet and labelling for that emotion.3. The BETO model, with the same pre-process as the training algorithm, but without removing the lexicons. 4 . Same as the first one, but using multilingual embeddings and a logistic regression.Most experiments differ in the pre-processing because the training set was labeled using words included on the tweets and thus, over-fitting was highly probable. To test if the models were learning lexicon presence or actual semantic context, in experiments first and fourth, we decided to perform evaluations on the tweets after removing the lexicons. Finally, to have a baseline mode, in the fourth experiment, we repeated the first experiment, but with a BERT multilingual embedding.The model obtained with experiment #1 was trained, validated and deployed in AWS to create a system that is sustainable, resilient and for long-term use, as shown in Figure 1 . Table 1 shows map, hamming loss and mean F1 score of the experiments on the validation dataset. We show the results of the baseline model -using multilingual embeddings and a logistic regression-in experiment #4. Map and mean F1 are better with higher values, and hamming loss is better with lower values. Highlighted numbers are the best result for each metric. Both map and mean F1 got the best results on experiment #3 and the hamming loss was best on (lexicons-only) experiment #2. The hamming loss is not class-weight dependent. Therefore, experiment #2 got the best hamming loss because it is over-fitting on some of the emotions. We found that the tweets are -generally-more weighted towards joy while toward anger or disgust are rare. Map and mean F1 are more adequate measurements for unbalanced datasets. The BERT models in experiments #1 and #3 performed well on such unbalanced setting. Figure 2 shows the evolution of joy and fear emotions on the people responses to the Twitter account of Medellín's major Daniel Quintero. On August 9th, a peak of joy can be seen: This day the major twitted that he healed from COVID-19. On August 28th, the major announced that the economic reopening was going to happen: This triggered fear among the users reflected on their responses to his tweets. In this paper, we presented a system that -continuously-access tweets from accounts in main cities of Colombia as well as from some politicians and health-authorities Twitter accounts in order to train a BERT model that monitors emotions to increase preparedness for disease outbreaks. The deployed system was validated by decision makers of a Colombian private-insurance company.There are three main conclusions of this work. First, we found out that -oposed to a previous work [7] -, emoticons and hashtags do not play a significant role in the semantics of tweets in Colombian main cities nor people's responses to politicians and health-authorities Twitter accounts. We believe this is because in developing regions there is not yet a culture of a systematic use of emoticons and hashtags as it is the case of developed regions. Second, the outbreak of COVID-19 exposed the lack of preparedness for such events in many nations around the globe; nonetheless, the tool we presented can be easily extended for future disease outbreaks and other events by simply changing the filtering keywords. Finally, we leave as a future study how to combine Ekman's six basic emotions to monitor anxiety and depression, as it is proposed in [8] .",Colombia,abstract,2020-12-17,12
07a4fc9f48867603b6c67aebf421850e0a42a8c0,"An epidemic model for COVID-19 transmission in Mar del Plata, Argentina: Exploration of the alternating quarantine and massive testing strategies","In March 2020 the World Heath Organization (WHO) officially announced the COVID-19 (disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) as a pandemic. The world was about to witness one of the most devastating pandemics in last decades. In December 2019, a cluster of a novel pneumonia-like illness was identified in Wuhan (China) and, without the proper control measures, in 3 months the disease rapidly spread all over the world. The first stages of the propagation occurred in different countries of Europe, leading to countless human life losses and a severe economic crisis.On March 3, the first COVID-19 patient was confirmed in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was an imported case, a 43-year-old man who had arrived from Milan, Italy. Following international protocols and recommendations of local experts, educational centers of all levels were closed, massive shows were suspended and international frontiers were closed. Decisively, on March 19 and in order to restrict the spread of the new coronavirus, the national government announced a 12 days nationwide lockdown for all citizens in the country [1] . These measures were extended progressively until nowadays with certain relaxations. Until the middle of September, the total number of confirmed cases surpassed 750 thousand and the number of fatalities was around 17 thousand, most of them concentrated in the Capital Federal (CABA) and the suburbs, which form the urban conglomerate denoted by AMBA, inhabited by 37% of the total population in Argentina.Researchers have put a lot of effort in the study of multiple aspects of COVID-19 pandemic in several countries [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , at country level and at big regions with a high concentration of people [7] . For instance, Romero et al [8] simulated an agent-based model for COVID-19 in Argentina. The authors analyzed the evolution of four different pandemic scenarios, with different levels of restriction in population mobility, and they found that social isolation is the measure that has more impact in the spread of the virus. In the same way, in [9] , researchers found that early school closures effectively helped in reducing the mortality rate in Argentina, Italy and South Korea. For its part, Torrente et al [10] showed the psychological impacts of the pandemic and early measures implemented, in the form of substantial anxious and depressive symptoms. Moreover, Quirós et al [11] conducted a seroprevalence study in one of the largest slums in CABA and found, three months after the first reported case, a prevalence of 53.4%. Mobility was also analyzed in Buenos Aires City, as a proxy for effectiveness of lockdown measures. For instance, in [12] , researchers found a delay of 8 days between changes in mobility and reported cases, while deaths follow cases from 16 to 19 days after.Beyond the measures imposed by the government at a national level, each city has the autonomy of taking different actions against the disease. Crucial factors such as hospital capacity, demographic structure, and economic activities, among others, strongly vary between cities. Therefore, local authorities must adapt national guidelines to their own region and determine proper criteria in the decision-making process. For this reason, our study is focused in Mar del Plata (MDP), the main city of the Municipality of General Pueyrredón in Argentina. With this work we aim to provide a key study that will help local governments in decision-making and implementation of mitigation strategies, as well as estimating the medical resources required to face the consequences of such decisions.The social and demographic structure of the population is generally reflected in heterogeneous contact patterns among individuals, where age is one of the main determinants of these mixing patterns. For instance, children tend to spend more time with children and members of their household; active adults mix with individuals in their workplace; and so forth. For this reason, a disease transmission route may have mixing patterns among individuals of different age [13] . To account for this contact structure, we use census collected data given by national agencies [14] . We divided the population into age groups and compute different contact matrices associated to different settings -household, workplace, school and general community [15, 16] .Once we obtained the Mar del Plata network structure, we consider an extension of the compartmental Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model [17] -known as SEIRD-to estimate the evolution of an epidemic. Here, D takes into account the individuals that died as a consequence of the disease. Also, we differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals, considering different levels of illness severity for symptomatic patients. As in the real-life scenario, some individuals may not require medical attention at all (mild) and only will have to stay for a certain time at home, while others (severe) will require hospitalization [18] .Even though the scientific community all over the world is working relentlessly in the development of a vaccine, it will take several months to be applied to the majority of the population, therefore, for now, non-pharmaceutical interventions are necessary to prevent the spread of the virus [19] [20] [21] . Conversely, measures such as long lasting quarantines also carry serious psychological and economic consequences, that must be considered. Thus, assessing the severity of SARS-CoV-2 and the study of social-distance mitigation strategies are crucial. Related to this topic, Meidan et al [22] proposed a novel alternating quarantine strategy (AQ). In this strategy the population is separate into two groups, in which they alternate successively between quarantine and regular activity in a bi-weekly cycle. They found that this measure can be useful as a primary mitigation strategy, with a comparable impact to that of a strict population-wide quarantine. Nevertheless, the weekly relief allowing people an outlet to continue their activity for half of the time may, itself, increase cooperation levels. Indeed, while a complete lock-down is extremely stressful for the individual, the alternating bi-weekly quarantine routine relaxes the burden, and may encourage compliance.In this research, we propose a different quarantine scenario with time-windows relaxation of activities -such as opening and closing activities by groups-and we are particularly interested in studying the impact of the implementation of tests. In a different manner from previous studies, in our model we use additional states to describe in more realistic way the hospitalized cases, inasmuch as we are especially interested in estimating the medical resources that should be allocated to sick patients. It is important to note that, even though we chose MDP and calibrated the model for COVID-19, our study can be adapted to any region or country where demographic information is available, and for diseases transmitted similarly by contact.In this work, we use an extension of the SEIR model to study the spread of COVID-19 in MDP. In this model individuals can be assigned to four different compartments, depending on their health status. Susceptible (S) individuals are healthy and prone to be infected, becoming exposed (E) when this occurs. At the E stage, individuals have not developed symptoms yet and they are not contagious. With the onset of symptoms, exposed individuals become infected (I) and can propagate the disease. Finally, recovered (R) individuals have acquired immunity and no longer propagate the disease. One modification we make to this model is the addition of a compartment of deceased (D) individuals, which are usually not distinguished from the recovered individuals. Additionally, we include a compartment of asymptomatic (A) individuals, taking into account the infected people who show no symptoms but can still propagate the disease (several publications [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] have reported the importance of asymptomatic individuals in the transmission of COVID-19).As we are especially interested in estimating the medical resources that should be allocated to sick individuals, we model their evolution by recognizing different levels of illness severity. On the one hand, some cases develop a mild (M ) version of the disease. Thus, according to the protocol applied in Argentina, they may not require medical care, but must remain isolated at their homes or in isolation sites prepared for this purpose, until they recover. On the other hand, some individuals develop more serious symptoms and are hospitalized (H) for control. Finally, we divide the hospitalized patients into four categories, based on the fact that the evolution of each type of patient has particular characteristic times and requires different resources from the hospital:1. H: those in general beds who will fully recover from the disease, 2. H * : those in the intensive care units (ICU) who will fully recover from the disease, 3 . H † : those in general beds who will die, 4. H † * : those in the ICU who will die. Note that we use H when referring to all compartments of hospitalized individuals together, as a set. For the different subgroups of H, i.e, the H's, we use a dagger ( †) as a notation to mark the compartments that evolve to the compartment D of deceased individuals, while an asterisk ( * ) denotes the compartments of individuals that make use of intensive care units (ICU).In Fig 1 we show a flowchart of our model. At the beginning, most of the population starts in the S compartment. With an effective rate dependent on β, susceptible individuals evolve to the E compartment, because of the interaction with the infected population. The exposed population becomes infected with rate α; a fraction develops symptoms and progresses to the I compartment, while the remaining goes to the asymptomatic compartment A. We consider that symptomatic individuals do not immediately become aware of their health state, thus, we include a rate ω for the progression of symptomatic infected (I) individuals to the M and H compartments. After this, only a fraction ζ of I individuals are hospitalized, while the remaining are isolated at home (M compartment). These isolated individuals fully recover from the disease with rate γ m . On the right side of the flow chart we have the four compartments of hospitalized patients, which are differentiated with the presence of superscripts. The population going to these compartments is determined by the values of the corresponding fractions θ, θ * , θ † and θ † * . On the other hand, the exit of these compartments is done with different γ-rates, in case the patients recover, or with different δ-rates, for fatal cases. Note that patients in the ICU who will recover, i.e., members of the H * compartment, first flow to the H compartment.The choice of multiple H compartments ensures that the fractions of patients who fully recover from the disease and those who die are consistent with the values reported in the literature. These fractions are only determined by θ, θ * , θ † , and θ † * , and not by the output rates. A summary of the states and parameters can be found in S1 Table and S2 Table. System of equationsIn an effort to better represent the society we are studying, we will divide the population into age groups and incorporate contact matrices [28] to our model. These matrices indicate the mixing patterns between individuals of the population, i.e., the frequency with which people of a certain age interact with each other, and with people from different age groups. This enables us to estimate better the impact over the health system, and the medical resources that will be required. For this matter, we use the census data collected by official organizations [14] and the inferring method developed in [16] to compute the matrices associated with different kinds of social settings: households, workplaces, schools, and general community. For the sake of this work being self-contained, a summary of the inference method can be found in S1 Calculation.Each age group has its own set of equations describing the evolution of the disease spread, which is indicated by the subscript i. Note that some parameters are age-dependent while others are not, indicated by the presence or absence of this subscript. The evolution of each group is given by:Flowchart of our epidemic model. We estimate the initial values of individuals in each compartment by adjusting the curve of deaths in the municipality. The susceptible population S evolves to the exposed compartment E with and effective rate dependent on β because of the interaction with symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals, I and A, respectively. The exposed population becomes infected with rate α; a fraction develops symptoms and progresses to the I compartment, while the remaining goes to the asymptomatic compartment A. Symptomatic infected individuals pass to one of the compartments among the M and H with a rate ω. On the right side of the flow chart we have the four hospitalized compartments, which are differentiated with the presence of superscripts. Finally, individuals can end up in one of the two final states, recovered (R) or deceased (D). Note that the gray arrow from the A to the M compartment corresponds to the testing strategy we explain in the Asymptomatic testing subsection.where the force of infection F i (t) is defined bybeing C ij the element of the contact matrix which gives the contact frequency between individuals of age i and j, and N j the total number of individuals of age j. S1 Table and S2 Table show the parameters of our model and their values. We denote β as β f ree for the case of free propagation without intervention.In the absence of a vaccine that would prevent the disease from spreading widely, it is of major importance that society implements different non-medical policies to prevent and mitigate the damages that COVID-19 may cause. Being able to estimate the amount of resources that will be needed, as the epidemic progresses, is a key aspect that authorities should seek in order to implement appropriate policies. In this section, we present a particular intervention strategy that could be helpful in accomplishing a rather controlled progression of COVID-19 in any population, although we focus in MDP, for which we use its census data. The AQ (alternating quarantine) strategy consists in dividing the population into different groups that face alternate periods of activity/isolation, in terms of socioeconomic activities (education, work, recreation, transportation, etc.). There is one group that it is permanently active (labeled as q 0 ). The remaining population is separated into two equal parts (q 1 and q 2 ), one that is active and in contact with the q 0 group, and one that implements a strict lockdown (these isolated individuals can not propagate the disease). After an established period of time τ , q 1 and q 2 switch places. This parameter will be tuned in order to find the best possible scenario for diminishing the spread of the disease.For this strategy, we subdivide each compartment S i , E i , I i and A i into three groups q 0 , q 1 , and q 2 (the labels represent also the fraction of the population in each group). Thus, adapting Eq. (12) to the case of alternating quarantine, the force of infection for each group must be rewritten as follows:The rates of infection are given by:where Θ(·) ∈ [0, 1] is the Heaviside function, so that β q 1 /q 2 ≤ β f ree , and Θ Sin πt τ is a periodic square function of period 2τ . Note that β q 1 and β q 2 are perfectly out of phase.A very important tool when facing an epidemic outbreak is the diagnostic of sick people [29] . Identifying infected individuals is crucial to attenuate the propagation, because it allow authorities to isolate specific carriers of the disease. Particularly, the detection of asymptomatic infected individuals (compartment A) is a difficult task to achieve, since these individuals do not know they are ill and, therefore, do not seek for medical attention. It is extremely important to find and isolate them as quickly as possible. For this reason, along with the AQ strategy, we implement the testing of a part of the asymptomatic individuals, which then flow, with rate r test , to the compartment M of mild patients (see Fig 1) . As it is a test without contact tracing in the population, susceptible and exposed individuals will also be randomly tested (which will be considered with a negative result and will remain in their compartment). In the same way, symptomatic infected individuals could also be found, who will be admitted to the hospital or isolated, as previously explained about the evolution of this type of individuals. Mathematically, this means replacing in Eqs. (3), (5)-(9) ω by ω = ω + r test . As it is an expensive strategy, we consider that it ceases to be applied when the curve of infected individuals falls below its initial value.We expect, however, additional measures to be implemented parallel to the AQ strategy and the asymptomatic individuals seeking, to help and reinforce the mitigation capacity of the society against the spread of COVID-19, such as the extended use of face masks, keeping strict hygienic regulations at the workplace, physical distancing and reduction of social gatherings.In general, local and national governments make public health decisions based on the projected availability of medical resources, such as ICU capacity, in terms of beds, ventilators, and the specialized workers which operate the equipment and treat the patients [30, 31] . The exponential growth of COVID-19 spread may cause a quickly depletion of resources and the saturation of the health system. As a result, an important number of people may not have access to appropriate treatments and could die. Therefore, we consider that a statistical study that explores the evolution of the ICU resources from the health system is of utmost importance. For this reason, we implement a finite number of ICU resources and consider that, when the occupation reaches this limit, the health system is saturated, meaning that new patients that require ICU immediately evolve to the compartment D of deceased individuals, as long as the system remains saturated. We study particularly the consequences of an overwhelmed health system by looking to the amount of avoidable deaths.Despite the fact that the local authorities have not reported an official number of available ICU beds [32] , we estimate that there are roughly 180 ICU beds in the municipality, and approximately 60 of these beds are available to accommodate COVID-19 patients [33, 34] .This section will study the effect of a massive testing and AQ strategies applied since September 30, 2020. Note that before this date, the municipality had imposed a mandatory lock-down [35] where many non-essential stores were closed. Fitting our model (see Eqs.(1)-(11)) to the actual data from August 18 to September 30, we obtain that in this period, the effective reproductive number was R 0 = 1.5, and the effective rate of infection was β = 3.45. To fit β, we integrate our differential equations for different values of β in the interval [2.3, 8 .0] (corresponding to R 0 ∈ [1.0, 3.5]), and then, we choose the optimum value that minimizes the square distance between the predicted number of accumulated deaths and their reported values. Note that we integrate our equations without any strategy to fit our model to the data. The value of R 0 found is notably lower than the reproductive number R 0 ≈ 2.5 (β f ree = 5.6) that was estimated in previous works [36] [37] [38] for a free propagation without any intervention. This result indicates that the municipality's policies were successful in slowing down the spread of the virus but they also caused a substantial economic cost.We first study the effect of the AQ on the epidemic spreading for different values of τ and q 0 , without implementing the testing strategy (r test = 0). To this end, we solve numerically Eqs. (1)- (11) and compute the cumulative number of infected individuals at the final state (when I ≈ 0), and the height of the peak of active cases under the AQ routine. In Fig 2, these two quantities are plotted as a function of the period τ , which ranges from 1 to 14 days. To easily compare the curves of different values of q 0 , we applied a linear transformation on the y-axis to show the y-coordinates in the interval [0, 1]. As can be seen, the optimal value of τ is weakly dependent of the parameter q 0 , with 9 days being the optimum for the accumulated cases (Fig 2A) and 8 days for the peak of active cases ( Fig 2B) . From here on, we use τ = 7 in our simulations as it is close to optimal, and in this way, the AQ can be in phase with the standard week. Note that for the particular case q 0 = 1, the entire population is permanently active, i.e., the AQ strategy is not applied.In the following, we will study the joint effect of the testing and AQ strategies on the epidemic spreading and how they reduce the pressure on the health system. In Fig 3A we show, a heat map of the peak value of symptomatic infected individuals (I) as a function of the fraction of the permanently active population q 0 and the test rate r test . It can be seen that there is a region where the peak coincides with the initial value of infected individuals, implying that the curve of infected cases declines immediately after applying both strategies. In contrast, for higher values of q 0 and lower values of r test , the peak of infected individuals is up to 10 times higher than the initial condition I(t = 0) = I 0 . This behavior is also shown in Fig 3B, where we plot the time evolution of infected individuals for an increasing value of r test and q 0 = 0.7. Recall that the testing strategy is only applied while the number (1)- (11) , and the error bars were estimated from 40 stochastic simulations. of infected individuals is greater than I 0 , and hence, when I(t) < I 0 , a second wave may hit the municipality. However, for all explored values of r test and q 0 , we observed that the second wave was either absent or its peak was very close to I 0 . Moreover, for large values of r test , I(t) has a plateau and is slowly decreasing, suggesting that the system is close to a critical point, i.e., the effective reproductive number is R 0 ≈ 1. In the supplementary material (see S1 Fig) we present additional results for the cumulative number of infected individuals.To further elucidate the effect of the epidemic spreading on the health system, we will compute the minimum number of ICU beds (B min ) to prevent an overwhelmed healthcare system. In order to estimate this magnitude we compute the time evolution of the number of critical patients when there is no restriction on the number of ICU beds, as shown in Fig 4A, for the same values of q 0 and r test previously used in 3B. Note that the height of the peak of this curve indicates the value of B min that prevents ICU saturation. In Fig 4B we plot a heat map of B min and we obtain, as expected, that the two proposed strategies reduce the pressure on the health system, i.e., B min decreases for larger values of r test and smaller values of q 0 . Note that the region to the left side of each isoline of B min (solid black lines) corresponds to the values of q 0 and r test where the demand for ICU resources does not exceed the supply B min . Remarkably, we observed that each line for B min < 100 becomes vertical for a given value of q 0 . Therefore, above this threshold and regardless of the testing strategy level, the demand will overwhelm the ICU supply. In the supplementary material (see S2 Fig) , we include a heat map of the period of time in which the health system is overwhelmed when the number of ICU beds is 60.In addition, it is also relevant to estimate the total number of tests T test that the municipality must purchase for a given value of r test and q 0 because this magnitude can be used to assess the budgetary impact of a massive testing strategy. To estimate this magnitude, we accumulate from our equations, the number of tests used per unit time for 300 days since September 30. The results of this procedure are shown in Fig. 4B as T test -isolines in the plane r test -q 0 (dashed blue lines). The intersection between the left region of a T test -isoline and a B min -isoline indicates the values of q 0 and r test that meet the budget and ICU capacity. Notably, for a given value of q 0 , the total number of tests saturates as the testing rate r test increases, which is observed in the figure as a vertical T test -isoline.On the other hand, since the ICU bed capacity is a critical bottleneck for the health care system, policymakers must know the total number of deaths D tot if the ICU capacity is not increased, and also how many deaths would be avoided if the hospitals ensured a minimum number of ICU beds to prevent saturation. In Fig. 4C we show a heat map of D tot at the final state when the number of ICU beds is 60. In the range of explored values, we observe that decreasing the fraction of permanently active individuals (q 0 ) reduces the total number of deaths D tot more significantly than a higher testing rate r test . Furthermore, the massive testing strategy has a meaningful effect on D tot only when q 0 > 0.7. Besides, we also include in the same figure the isolines of the number of deaths avoided (dashed blue lines) in the scenario where the authorities extend the ICU capacity to prevent an overwhelmed health care system. It can be seen that for the case of a weak AQ strategy (high values of q 0 ) the total number of deaths due to the lack of ICU beds ranges from 250 to 1000 people which corresponds to up to 30% of the total number of deaths.In this paper we studied a mitigation strategy for COVID-19 spread in Mar del Plata, based on an extended SEIR model, where detected cases are confined and do not propagate the disease. It consists in an alternating quarantine where a portion of the population remains always active, while the rest is divided in two groups and enters a cycle of activity and isolation with period 2τ . We found that a time-window of τ = 7 days is the best alternative as it reduces the peak of active and cumulative cases of detected symptomatic patients (a fraction of which eventually die), while it fits with the usual weekly cycle, being easy to implement. Furthermore, we add a testing strategy on the general population, until the number of confirmed cases goes under the initial level. We focused on the pressure over the health system and the death toll that an overwhelmed system may cause. We found that, given the situation in Mar del Plata as of September 30, extremely low levels of normal circulation would be necessary in order to avoid the saturation of the health system, regardless of the testing rate. The number of ICU beds necessary to prevent saturation increases with the fraction of the population that remains always active, but this number can be shortened by means of an aggressive testing strategy. In the worst case scenario, we estimate that thousands of people may die, but would not if correctly assisted. Therefore, we consider that implementing an alternating quarantine strategy with high testing rates and medium-to-low levels of free circulation is fundamental in order to change the trend of COVID-19 spread in Mar del Plata. Authorities might have to balance testing and equipment costs with mobility levels of the population, in order to arrive at a consistent strategy that people is able to follow, thus, ensuring compliance and reducing the economic, social and psychological effects that long and extended -or the lack of -quarantines produce.Finally, we emphasize the usefulness of having a model that incorporates the characteristics of society in a specific city, as a tool for local authorities to make informed decisions. This model can be calibrated to study any disease transmitted by direct contact and adapted to other cities using the corresponding census data.Supporting information S1 Calculation. Inference of contact matrices. In order to compute the matrix of an arbitrary setting ∆ we assume that, for an individual k of age group i who shares a particular setting a (k) with other people, on a regular basis, the contact frequency within this setting is homogeneous, i.e., the probability that k contacts an individual of age group j is proportional to the number a (k) j of these individuals. Therefore, if we denote by v (k) ∆ as the total number of people in a (k) , we can compute this probability as aConsequently, the frequency of contacts between individuals of age groups i and j, in all settings of type ∆, iswhere N i is the total number of individuals of age group i in the entire population, and n ∆ i is the number of individuals of age group i with nonzero contacts in the setting ∆. Note that the Kronecker delta (δ ij ) in the numerator avoids counting k as a self-contact. After computing f ∆ ij , the contact matrix associated with setting ∆ is given byPerforming this calculation for households, workplaces, schools and the general community, we obtain a final expression for the contact matrix by taking the weighted sumwhere the weight ω ∆ represents the proportion of transmission events that take place in setting ∆. In Ref. [16] , the authors consider four social settings: households, workplaces, schools, and general community, and estimate the following weights based on empirical data for influenza-like diseases:In our model with alternating quarantine strategy, we set that the active population has the same weights as in Ref. [16] , whereas for the quarantined population we set w work = w school = 0, and reduce w comm by a 93.5%. This percentage is based on a 7-day average as of March 29 of Google's mobility data for transit stations and retail & recreation which corresponds to the early stage of the COVID outbreak when the country was in strict quarantine. Thus, the normalized weights for the quarantined population are given by:Similarly, based on the mobility reported by Google as of August 14 (average of 7 days), we use the following weights to fit the curve of accumulated deaths in General Pueyrredón from August 18 to September 30 (prior to implementing the mitigation strategies):w house = 0.79, w work = 0.13, w school = 0.08, w comm = 0.02. S1 Table. Age-independent parameters. [42] †: These works report the value of R 0 in the stage of free propagation, from which we calculate β f ree using the next generation matrix method [45] .‡: We subtract two days from the time of transition E → I reported in [37, 39, 40] , since in [41] the authors estimated that patients are infectious two days before showing symptoms. Therefore, infectious patients also stay two additional days in the community, increasing the time of transition I → M and I → H reported in [42] .¤: Health authorities in Argentina require mild patients to remain self-isolated at home, and these cases are reported as recovered after 14 days since their first symptoms appeared.S2 Table. Age-dependent parameters. [11, 46] . Here we define a positive case as either a symptomatic patient or an asymptomatic patient who has been detected by the massive testing strategy. In panel (A) we note that different values of r test have little effect on the curve for the first 30 days. Similarly, we obtain that for t → ∞ and r test > 0, the strategy has a negligible impact on the final number of positive cases (see panels A and B). As a consequence, these results suggest that it is difficult to assess the impact of such a strategy on the epidemic spreading in the short and long term if the health authorities only report the accumulated number of positive cases, and hence, alternative measures must be considered.S2 Fig. Number of days with an overwhelmed health system. Heat map of the number of days in which hospitals are overwhelmed in the plane r test − q 0 when the number of ICU beds is 60. In the upper right region, this period increases because a higher testing rate delays the extinction of the disease by several weeks, and a weak alternating quarantine (q 0 ≈ 1) leaves a large proportion of the population exposed to COVID-19.",Argentina,abstract,2020-12-04,12
2a96f629fc262125c6322ef3eb8b2f724a0bdb8f,Loss of orf3b in the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains,"In late 2019, the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a global pandemic of COVID-19 in an unprecedented scale. According to the statistics from World Health Organization (WHO) released on 19 September 2020, there are over 35 million total confirmed cases and over one million deaths globally (https:// covid19.who.int/). Several determinants contribute to this large-scale pandemic including the presence of large number of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients, effective human-to-human transmission and immunomodulatory characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 [1] [2] [3] . Current efforts have been made for developing antivirals, immunomodulatory agents for alleviating disease severity, safe and effective vaccines, as well as rapid and accurate diagnostic tools by the unprecedented close collaborations between governments, pharmaceutical companies and various institutions. To tackle this novel emerging viral infectious disease, understanding the viral genome and evolution, viral protein function and structure, viral pathogenesis and transmissibility, is critical for the successful development of accurate diagnostic assays, effective therapeutics and vaccination.Continuous phylogenetic analysis on the bank of open-source whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 not only provides valuable information on its genome structures, but also allows in-depth analysis on the evolution of the virus, which serves as the basis of therapeutics developments. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the subgenus of Sarbecovirus under the genus of betacoronavirus, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-related-CoVs [4] . Its genome encodes 27 proteins, in which the structural proteins, non-structural proteins and the accessory proteins are highly similar to its closely related betacoronaviruses, except the spike, orf3b, and orf8. Naturally, sporadic mutations arise frequently during the SARS-CoV-2 transmission which are considered useful genetic markers to visualize the transmission path, understand the observed changes in pathogenesis and give clues for the control of this pandemic. For instance, spike D614G substitution that arose in January has enhanced the virus transmissibility and infectivity [5, 6] . The spike G614 genotype soon became the dominant species. Regarding the accessory proteins, both orf6 and orf8 deletions have been reported [7, 8] . In particular, the 27-nucleotide deletion in orf6 will possibly alter protein folding, and the 382-nucleotide deletions in orf8 will very likely cause the loss of protein expression. Albeit seemingly minor, these deletion mutations will likely cause a change in the virus phenotype. For example, milder infections were reported in orf8-deleted virus infected patients [9] . Such alterations in the virus genome at genes unique to SARS-CoV-2 may also affect the targets for serological tracking and also the development of accurate diagnostic assays.Previously, orf3b has been first proposed as a SARS-CoV-2 protein by our genome analysis published during early outbreak of COVID-19 [4] . It is translated from the frame 3 of orf3a gene (25524-25697 nt; 174 bp) and encodes a protein with 57 amino acids. A proteomic study identified STOML2 as its binding partner [10] and it may play a role in mitochondrial homeostasis [11] . More importantly, a recent serological study demonstrated a strong antibody response against orf3b protein in a cohort of COVID-19 patients and the anti-orf3b antibodies have been proposed for the use as the serological markers of early and late infection [12] . It is noted that a recent paper studying a putative orf3 protein (a 22 amino acids peptide predicted from frame 3 of orf3a (25814-25882; 69 bp)) and named it as orf3b [13] . Its amino acid sequence is totally different from the orf3b described in this and other studies [4, 10, 12] .Here, we report the increasing dominance of orf3b-deleted virus strains amongst the over 100,000 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. We showed that the Q57H amino acid substitution in SARS-CoV-2 orf3a gives rise to a premature stop codon in the reading frame for orf3b, and such genotype contributes to 23.82% of analysed sequences. There was an increasing number of viruses with loss of orf3b that has reached over 31.86% in May 2020, suggesting an increasing prevalence of its circulation. Moreover, several locations have increased prevalence of viruses with loss of orf3b, including Colombia (46%), USA (48%), South Korea (51%), France (66%), Saudi Arabia (72%), Finland (76%) and Egypt (77%), suggesting that significant host serological differences and immune pressure may exist which leads to the virus escape from such immune pressure of human population by the loss of orf3b protein. Furthermore, we performed structural prediction on both fulllength orf3b and truncated-orf3b and determine that the truncated mutant will very likely lead to the loss of orf3b protein. Our previous report identified four most potent SARS-CoV-2 interferon antagonists including NSP13, NSP14, NSP15 and orf6 [14] . Orf3b has been shown to inhibit interferon production, but to a lesser extent when compared to orf6. Therefore, we have examined the interferon antagonism of wild-type and truncated-orf3b and confirmed that truncated orf3b loses its activity of interferon antagonism. Further in-vivo and in-vitro study of orf3b may reveal additional functions on viral pathogenesis and modulation of host cell signalling pathways, hinting a functional impact on this virus on its host adaptation or evolution. Taken together, our study indicates that there is increasing circulation of SARS-CoV-2 with the loss of orf3b in the ongoing pandemic, which coincides with the emergence of spike D614G virus strains. More attention on the loss of orf3b is required for the future surveillance, design of serological tests, development of vaccines and diagnostic tools for COVID-19.Cell culture and transfection 293FT cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal bovine serum (FBS). Gene-Juice (Novagen) was used for transfection according to manufacturer's instruction.Gene fragments encoding SARS-CoV-2 orf3a and fulllength orf3b were obtained in previous study [14] . The fragment containing orf3a with H57 genotype was generated by PCR, while the fragment for truncated orf3b with 13 amino acids were synthesized as short oligos (BGI). All gene fragments were cloned into pCAGEN expression vector with c-terminal FLAGtag and confirmed by Sanger sequencing.293FT cells were transfected in triplicate with IFNβluc firefly luciferase reporter and pRL-TK Renilla luciferase reporter (Promega), RIG-IN [15] , together with the indicated expression plasmids. Cells were lysed at 24 h post-transfection using 1X passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase signals were quantified using Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega), represented as relative luciferase activity by dividing firefly luciferase signal with Renilla luciferase signal. Statistical analysis was performed by student's t test.Similar to luciferase assay, 293FT cells were transfected with RIG-IN and indicated expression plasmids. Cells were lysed at 24 h post-transfection directly with RNAiso (Takara) and cellular total RNA was extracted following manufacturer's instruction. Reverse transcription was performed with Prime-Script RT reagent kit with gDNA eraser (Takara) using the kit primer mix. IFNβ mRNA transcript expression was quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara). GAPDH was used as the housekeeping gene to determine relative transcript expression. Statistical analysis was performed by student's t test.Phylogenetic analysis and sequence analysis SARS-CoV-2 sequences and sequence author data were downloaded from GISAID depository and Next-Strain.org [16] . Acknowledgment table was listed in Supplementary Table S1. Multiple alignment of 106 representative SARS-CoV-2 sequences was performed using MAFFT online server (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/ alignment/server/) using default parameters, followed by phylogenetic tree analysis by MEGA X programme [17] . Phylogenetic tree was generated with Maximum Likelihood with bootstrapping value equals to 1000 and evolutionary analysis was conducted in MEGA X programme by using Tamura-Nei model. The tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths representing evolutionary distances. For sequence analysis, an inhouse python script was used to process 163,333 whole genome sequences. Low coverage sequences, sequences with gaps or ambiguous bases, sequences with no collection dates were filtered out, resulting in 150,198 sequences for formal analysis. Changes in respective nucleotide positions of interest were recorded and exported.Orf3b structural prediction was performed using comparative modelling with RosettaCM on Robetta protein structure prediction server [18] . The structure was modelled by the analysis of alignment clusters using HHSEARCH, SPARKS, and Raptor. The predicted structure was visualized and presented using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC).Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS) assay LIPS assay ( Figure S1 ) was performed according to a protocol previously described by Burbelo et al. [19] with modification. Renilla antigen was prepared by transfecting 293FT cells with Renilla luciferase-orf3b expression plasmid, followed by lysis at 48 h post-transfection. Heat-inactivated patient sera were 1:100 diluted and incubated with 1×10 7 light units of Renilla antigen on a rotary shaker. 1.5 µL of Protein A/G resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) diluted in PBS was then added to each sample and incubated to capture the antibody-antigen complex. Following three washes, the beads were transferred to an opaque 96well plate. Renilla substrate (Promega, USA) was then added and luciferase signal was measured using the Wallac Victor3 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer, USA).The SARS-CoV-2 virus has continued to evolve since its first appearance in late 2019. For instance, viruses with D614G mutation in Spike protein have acquired enhanced transmissibility and infectivity and become the dominant circulating strain [6, 20] . In order to better understand the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, we performed phylogenetic analysis of publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Consistent with published findings [10, 21] , we identified a distinct clade that represents the G25563T nucleotide mutation, which results in Q57H amino acid substitution in orf3a (red box in Figure 1A , and red lines in Figure 1B ). In our analysis, spike D614G substitution was also included as a reference since it signifies the evolutionary phases of SARS-CoV-2 (blue box in Figure 1A , and blue lines in Figure 1C ). All H57 strains clustered within the clades with spike G614, indicating that this mutation has co-evolved with the D614G mutation (blue box in Figure 1A and coloured as blue in Figure 1C ). While some spike G614 strains contain the orf3a Q57H mutation, all orf3a H57 strains contain the spike D614G mutation. Orf3a shares overlapping genome position at amino acid 44-102 with orf3b, which is a 57 amino acid open reading frame transcribed in frame 3 relative to orf3a (frame 1) (Figure 2A ). The G25563T mutation gives rise to orf3a Q57H substitution and also introduces an early stop codon to orf3b after amino acid 13 (Δ3b), causing a large truncation of 44 amino acids to the protein ( Figure 2B ). This implies that there are currently two co-circulating orf3b genotypes, one contains full-length orf3b, and the other has orf3b truncated. Also, the Δ3b viruses contain both the orf3a Q57H substitution and D614G mutation.To better visualize current circulation of the two distinct orf3b genotypes, we analysed sequence statistics Specific genotypes were highlighted in colours: orange for orf3a Q57, red for orf3a H57, green for spike D614, blue for spike G614. The distinct clade of orf3a H57 was also highlighted inside the red box, and the population for spike G614 in blue box.(B-C) Radial display of the phylogenetic analysis. Respective clade for orf3a and spike was labelled the same as the previous display. Table  S1 ). The sequence data were analysed and presented in Figure 3(A) . Based on the sequence information of 150,198 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences collected from December 2019 to September 2020, we found that 23.82% (35771/150198) of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences carry the Δ3b genotype. Notably, almost all (99.69%) genome sequences with Δ3b genotype contain spike D614G substitution. This is consistent with our phylogenetic analysis ( Figure 1 ) and further suggests the co-evolution of Δ3b genotype and spike D614G substitution.The sequence data set was further analysed by sorting them into respective months of sample collection and into their respective geographical locations in order to investigate the circulation pattern of Δ3b virus. The number and percentage of sequences with full length orf3b or Δ3b genotype were summarized in Figure 3 (B). Consistent with our phylogenetic analysis, SARS-CoV-2 strains carrying Δ3b genotype began to circulate in February ( Figure 3C) , where the spike G614 genotype coincidentally also began to rise in proportion ( Figure 3D ). The number of Δ3b virus strains persistently increases in circulation throughout the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The proportion of Δ3b genotype has reached 31.86% (4741/14880) in May 2020 and maintained 15-28% from June to September. This suggests that the Δ3b genotype has stably propagated for 8 months (February to September), with up to 20% of circulating viruses lacking the expression of full-length orf3b. Geographically, Δ3b viruses are present in 10 out of 12 countries with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases listed in WHO records ( Figure 4A ). Particularly, almost half of the available sequences from the USA (48.4%) and Colombia (46.3%) are Δ3b viruses, further confirming that Δ3b persists in the virus circulation. Furthermore, 8 other countries have more than 50% prevalence of Δ3b virus ( Figure 4B ), including Israel (80%), Egypt (77.4%), Finland (76%), Saudi Arabia (71.6%), France (66.2%), Denmark (63.9%), Indonesia (51.2%), and South Korea (51.0%). The extraordinary prevalence of Δ3b in these countries may suggest a significant serological difference among geographical locations. Our result indicates that precautions should be taken for using orf3b as a target for diagnostic or serological tests.Spontaneous mutations are generated during erroneous replication of viruses. Occasionally, these mutations can result in gain or loss of function of viral proteins, imposing phenotypic changes to the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 orf3b, the two genotypes, full-length orf3b (57a.a.) and Δ3b (13a.a.) respectively, give rise to two significantly different viral protein isoforms. In silico structural prediction shows that the full-length SARS-CoV-2 orf3b contains a long, flexible loop at N-terminus and three alpha helices ( Figure 5A-C) . The three alpha helices fold around to form a compact protein with ring-like structure. In stark contrast, Δ3b only contains the N-terminus flexible loop ( Figure 5D ; highlighted in red), which is difficult for computational structural analysis. Figure 5 (E) highlights the amino acid sequence of fulllength orf3b and Δ3b with corresponding colours to their predicted structures.Based on such drastic change in encoded protein length and structure, we therefore hypothesized that the premature stop codon imposed by Q57H substitution of orf3a would contribute to a loss of function of orf3b in these circulating strains. Our previous findings have showed that both SARS-CoV-2 orf3a and orf3b are able to antagonize type-I interferon activation [14] . Thus, we performed similar dual luciferase assay to determine the interferon antagonism of orf3a with Q57 and H57, as well as full-length orf3b and Δ3b. 293FT cells were co-transfected with interferon β (IFNβ) luciferase reporter, Renilla control luciferase reporter, expression plasmids for an active form of RIG-I (RIG-IN) and expression plasmids for the viral proteins. Orf6 was used as a control for interferon antagonism. Consistent with our published result, SARS-CoV-2 orf3a and full-length orf3b can significantly inhibit IFNβ activation, though not as potent as orf6 ( Figure 5F ). While H57 orf3a retained its interferon-antagonizing function, the 13a.a. truncated form of orf3b (Δ3b) has lost the ability to inhibit interferon induction. Similar result was also observed when IFNβ transcripts were quantitated by RT-qPCR ( Figure 5G ). These data reflect that the Q57H substitution resulted in a loss of function of orf3b by introducing an early stop codon. It is highly likely that the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 strains with Δ3b is altered to some extent.SARS-CoV-2 belongs to sarbecovirus and its overall genomic structure is similar to that of SARS-CoV. Like other betacoronaviruses, the sarbecovirus genome contains a 5' untranslated region (UTR); orf1ab encoding a long polypeptide that gives rise to 16 mature non-structure proteins (NSP 1-16); structural genes encoding surface spike glycoprotein, envelope and membrane protein; accessory genes including orf3a, orf3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and 9b; nucleoprotein gene and 3'UTR [4] . Within the orf3 genomic region, the full length orf3 sequences (frame 1) of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 encode the orf3a protein with high similarity [21] . The SARS-CoV orf3a has been shown to inhibit interferon signalling while the SARS-CoV-2 orf3a has been characterized as a proapoptotic factor [22] . For the SARS-CoV-2 orf3a, more than 50 non-synonymous mutations have been identified and the most frequent and dominant one is Q57H [21] . In an early proteomic study, Gordon et al. briefly mentioned a premature stop codon in SARS-CoV-2 orf3b at position 14 (E14) which is corresponding to the Q57H mutation in orf3a in their Extended Data Figure 1(b) [10] . Since then, no further detailed analysis on the prevalence of orf3a Q57H and truncation of orf3b has been reported.In the past nine months, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved rapidly and accumulated a considerable amount of mutations throughout the pandemic. While some of them are sporadic, certain mutations become dominant and such substitutions may have functional impacts on virus life cycle and infected hosts such as altered viral infectivity, replication, dissemination, and pathogenesis. One of the well-studied examples is spike protein D614G substitution, of which the G614 genotype is now dominant in circulating strains with higher infectivity [6] . Another example is the truncation/deletion of SARS-CoV-2 orf8 protein [9, 23] . These weaken orf8-deleted viruses which have not dominated or persisted in the human population were only found in certain locations such as Singapore, Taiwan, Australia, Bangladesh, and Spain [9] . We have recently characterized the SARS-CoV-2 orf8 as a highly immunologic secreted protein [24] . It will be of great interest to investigate the molecular mechanism of loss of orf8 on the viral replication and pathogenesis.In this study, we have identified the global circulation of a persistent orf3b-truncated SARS-CoV-2 population, the Δ3b viruses, in the current pandemic. We analysed over 150,000 sequences extracted from GISAID depository and constructed a phylogenetic tree with 106 representative sequences ( Figure 1) . We have demonstrated a distinct clade where all sequences contain orf3a Q57H substitution. It is noted that this substitution of orf3a has introduced a premature stop codon to orf3b, which utilizes a different reading frame ( Figure 2 ). This creates a truncated form of orf3b, Δ3b, which only encodes 13 amino acids, contrast to the full-length orf3b with 57 amino acids. Our phylogenetic analysis in this study demonstrated that Δ3b virus strains cluster together to form a distinct population.To determine the extent of circulation of Δ3b viruses, we compiled and analysed sequence data from GISAID and NextStrain.org by month ( Figure  3 ). We found that 23.82% of circulating sequences carry Δ3b in average. Most importantly, not only does the number of Δ3b sequences increases during the pandemic, but its emergence also coincides with the spike D614G viruses. Moreover, unlike truncations/mutations in other accessory proteins such as above-mentioned orf8 protein, SARS-CoV-2 Δ3b genotype is not localized in certain areas. In our geographic analysis, Δ3b viruses exist worldwide, including ten of the twelve countries with highest confirmed COVID-19 cases (Figure 4) , such as the USA (48.4%) and Colombia (46.3%). Also, more than 50% of available genome sequences in some locations are Δ3b, such as Israel (80%), Egypt (77.4%) and Saudi Arabia (71.6%). This shows that not only Δ3b is circulating globally with considerable prevalence, but also significant serological differences may exist. Thus, our findings provide invaluable information regarding the development of accurate diagnostic tools for COVID-19. Recently, human antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 orf3b has been detected in patient serum and orf3b was proposed as a novel serological marker for early and late infection [12] However, based on the differences we observed, the effectiveness of utilizing orf3b for diagnosis is doubtful as Δ3b viruses are persistent globally, with increasing prevalence in different locations. Nevertheless, the 13 amino acid of Δ3b may still be immunogenic, but whether it can be expressed as a proper immunogen or elicit an immune response comparable to full-length orf3b is still not known. More information such as orf3b epitope mapping and the differential expression of full-length orf3b and Δ3b during viral infection is essential for the consideration of using SARS-CoV-2 orf3b as a diagnostic marker. There are currently only two H57 cases reported in Hong Kong. To further testify the hypothesis that Δ3b may not able to induce the production orf3bspecific antibodies, we applied the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS) assay for the quantification of anti-orf3b antibody in serum samples of COVID-19 patients. Similar to the previous study on the use of orf3b and orf8 for the COVID-19 diagnosis [12] , around 70% of COVID-19 positive sera showed orf3b-positive signals ( Figure S1 ), indicating the presence of anti-orf3b antibodies. However, no positive readings were obtained using the serum samples of two Hong Kong H57 cases.We have also performed structural analysis on orf3b in order to predict changes in function for Δ3b ( Figure 5A-E) . Δ3b exists as a short peptide that is difficult for in silico structure prediction, and we hypothesized that it can hardly be expressed into a functional protein. As we have previously identified the SARS-CoV-2 orf3b as an interferon antagonist, we further tested the hypothesis by looking at its interferon antagonism through dual luciferase assay and RT-qPCR ( Figure 5F , G). Indeed, Δ3b has completely lost the interferon antagonism when compared to fulllength orf3b. As shown in our phylogenetic and sequence statistical analysis, all Δ3b carry G614 genotype. This implies that Δ3b viruses have increased infectivity and possibly reduced disease severity. The virus also persists in 15-28% of circulation. As such, the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to become an endemic cannot be neglected. Subtle changes such as Δ3b prevalence should be carefully monitored and must be coupled with molecular findings of the relevant viral proteins. However, to elucidate the detailed function of orf3b and the effect of Δ3b on SARS-CoV-2 replication, more sophisticated methods, such as recombinant infectious clones, should be applied. Moreover, clinical specimens of full-length orf3b and Δ3b (virus isolates with orf3a Q57 and H57 substitutions) could be a valuable tool to evaluate the clinical relevance of Δ3b variants. We have attempted to grow the only two Δ3b clinical samples found in Hong Kong, but no virus could be successfully isolated. Whether the Δ3b genotype will introduce a strong change in the infectivity and pathogenesis similar to spike G614 remains unknown, as our knowledge of the function of orf3b protein as well as clinical correlations are lacking. But the finding of the increasing global dominance Δ3b variant viruses suggests that the virus fitness is unlikely to be compromised despite the functional loss of interferon antagonism by orf3b which is likely to be compensated by NSP13, NSP14, NSP15 and orf6. Ultimately, further in vivo studies using mice or hamster model can shed light on the function of orf3b on the pathogenesis and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2.One of the key questions is whether SARS-CoV-2 evolves into a less lethal virus that adapts and circulates within our human population for a long period of time. Regarding to the evolution, virus may tend to decrease its virulence and increase its transmissibility for the better human adaptation and circulation. It will be of interest to understand whether loss of orf3b decreases the virulence and spike D614G substitution increases the transmissibility simultaneously. It is also important to analyse any correlation of Δ3b/D614G genotype and clinical manifestation of COVID-19 patients.In conclusion, our study has demonstrated the increasing trend of loss of orf3b in the current circulating SARS-CoV-2. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Δ3b viruses form a distinct clade and its emergence coincide with spike G614. The Δ3b virus variants persist in the circulation, with increasing trend throughout the pandemic, and may result in serological differences among countries. We also showed that Δ3b has lost its interferon antagonism, which reflects that Δ3b genotype can bring about a loss of function phenotype in SARS-CoV-2. Finally, careful considerations should be taken for using orf3b as a diagnostic marker for COVID-19 due to the global emergence of Δ3b variants. KHK, CKY, and KYY reviewed and edited the manuscript.

1022ffb83b31738ced2ba5ca5c61064b80547658,Socio-economic inequalities and COVID-19 incidence and mortality in Brazilian children: a nationwide register-based study,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is affecting a diverse group of individuals with varying severity during the ongoing global pandemic. 1 Accumulating evidence has shown that the proportion of COVID-19econfirmed cases among children is relatively small and deaths are uncommon, 2,3 but the impact of disease in pediatric populations is likely to vary considerably between and within countries.In a recent study, discussion was on the urgent need to understand comprehensive pediatric data from South America to implement proper preventive and treatment protocol in the region. 4 As part of South America, Brazil has seen a devastating spread of COVID-19 across the country. As of September 2020, Brazil had registered more than 4.1 million cases and 126,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the general population. Moreover, it is of utmost importance to understand whether geographic and socio-economic inequalities also help to explain the impact of COVID-19 in the pediatric population in Brazil.This nationwide register-based study had two complementary objectives: (1) to estimate the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 in Brazilian children and (2) to analyze its relationship with socio-economic inequalities in a state-level analysis.To estimate the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 in Brazilian children aged 0e19 years, we extracted data of confirmed cases and deaths from the de-identified microdata catalog and official bulletins of the 27 Brazilian states' health department websites until September 3, 2020. Incidence and mortality rates were calculated based on the population estimate provided by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (https://www.ibge. gov.br). We also calculate the case fatality rate dividing the number of confirmed deaths from COVID-19 by the number of registered cases in the pediatric population.Social inequality was evaluated using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) obtained from the Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA; http://ivs.ipea.gov.br). This index is composed of 16 social indicators comprising domains of urban infrastructure, human capital, and income and work in Brazil. We used the Gini coefficient, which is a measure of the distribution of income across a population, to examine the dispersion of economic inequality among Brazilian states (https://www.ibge.gov.br). The SVI and Gini index range from 0 to 1, and higher values indicate higher social and economic inequality, respectively. We analyzed the relationship between COVID-19 rates in Brazilian children and socio-economic vulnerability at the state level using Spearman's rank correlation (r), categorizing correlations as very weak (0e0.19), weak (0.2e0.39), moderate (0.4e0.59), strong (0.6e0.79), or very strong (0.8e1.0). P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All data were analyzed using R software (version 3.1.3).Of the 3,998,055 individuals with COVID-19 included in our database, 335,279 (8.4%) were children aged 0e19 years. The incidence rate of COVID-19 in Brazilian children was 559 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, with higher estimates in the North (1015 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) and Central-West (711 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) regions. Eight hundred deaths in children were registered, which accounts for about 0.7% of the deaths related to COVID-19 in the country. The higher mortality rates were found in the North (~3 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) and Northeast (~2 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) ( Table 1 ). Although we found no clear evidence of a relationship between the incidence of COVID-19 in children and socio-economic inequality in a state-level analysis, a correlation was found between mortality rates and social (r ¼ 0.519; P-value ¼ 0.007; effect magnitude: moderate) and economic (r ¼ 0.615; P-value < 0.001; effect magnitude: strong) inequalities (Fig. 1) .State-level reports are the best publicly available data in Brazil to explore regional differences in COVID-19 estimates and the impact of inequalities on unfavorable health outcomes related to the disease. Although we found a low mortality rate of approximately one death from COVID-19 per 100,000 in the pediatric population in the country, this population-based study showed a moderate to strong relationship between mortality and socioeconomic inequalities. Nevertheless, these results could be underestimating the true COVID-19 rates among children in Brazil because the official database used for analysis only accounts for confirmed cases, and it is well known that many cases go undiagnosed.Adverse outcomes due to COVID-19 are not only the result of individual clinical characteristics. Studies have suggested that the socio-economic and environmental conditions may also be related to worse outcomes of COVID-19. 5,6 A recent country-level analysis on COVID-19erelated health outcomes showed that low levels of national preparedness, scale of testing, and socio-economic factors are associated with the increased national case load and mortality. 6 It is important to recognize health inequalities among vulnerable populations to improve access to health care, the surveillance system, protocols for diagnosis and management, and effective social protection response during disease outbreaks.The COVID-19 pandemic has led to dramatic changes in people's lives especially in low-and middle-income countries. Despite reduction in health, income, and schooling inequalities in the last decade in Brazil, socio-economic disparities are still a major problem in the country and have a pivotal role in the widening health and economic gap, both within and between communities. There are millions of Brazilian people living in highly dense communities, with precarious housing conditions and poor sanitation, which increase the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spread and mortality. 7 For children, the COVID-19 pandemic has also been associated with profound educational, social, and psychological changes, food insecurity, and increased risk of serious adverse outcomes that can result in death in more deprived regions. 8, 9 COVID-19 mortality in children in high-income countries is extremely rare, 10 but the disease has emerged as a novel cause of death among children in poor communities as observed in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil. The knowledge of sociogeographic differences in the estimates of COVID-19 is crucial to planning societal strategies and local decision-making to mitigate the effects of disease in the pediatric population.Although exploratory analysis using publicly available data has limitations associated with the lack of accuracy, this populationbased study found important regional differences in COVID-19 estimates for children in Brazil and a relationship between mortality rates and socio-economic inequalities.The authors dedicate this article to all health professionals who are facing the COVID-19 pandemic.

f9fa41d09d886e22ea94d5107e3f6d88e02ce9b3,Sharp increase in depression and anxiety among Brazilian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: findings from the PAMPA cohort,"Since it was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus disease has elevated the attention toward mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression. 1 However, in many countries they were public health concerns even before COVID-19. The total number of people living with depressive or anxiety disorders in the world was 322 and 264 million in 2015, respectively. 2 Brazil ranked fifth and first for the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders, respectively, with the highest proportion of cases reported in the south region of the country. 3 As neither vaccines or treatment have been developed at this time, nonpharmacological strategies such as good personal hygiene and social distancing are the best approaches available to reduce virus transmission and associated mortality. 4e6 Social distancing actions have required interrupting all nonessential activities and services, such as commercial services, industries, malls, and schools. 5 Although effective in combating the spread of the virus, 5, 6 these approaches are likely to lead to mental distress due to acute financial strain and changes in household dynamics. Further, lifestyle changes such as increased physical inactivity 7 might heighten the incidence of mental disorders such as anxiety and depression. 8, 9 Other determinants for worse mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic have been proposed such as underlying health conditions and young age groups. 10, 11 However, most studies were carried out in high-income countries such as the United States, 12 United Kingdom, 10 and Austria. 11 Also, compliance with social distancing (e.g., stay at home, personal distancing) seems to increase depressive and anxiety symptoms. 12 Given the unprecedented situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, more studies are warranted to clarify the impact of preventive strategies such as social distancing in depressive and anxiety symptoms at the population level. 13 Social disparities in Brazil have led to further uneven health and economic consequences across the population during the COVID-19 pandemic. 14 In May 2020, the World Health Organization launched the ""COVID-19 and the Need for Action on Mental Health"" aiming to mitigate the mental health problems caused by COVID-19 around the world. 1 One of the recommended actions is to comprehend the extent of mental health consequences of COVID-19 and the subsequent social and economic effects. Using data from a retrospective longitudinal study in the Rio Grande do Sul state in Brazil, we aimed to (1) compare the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms before and during the pandemic and (2) identify factors associated with aggravated depressive and anxiety symptoms.The PAMPA cohort (Prospective Study About Mental and Physical Health) is an ambispective longitudinal observational study that aimed to identify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in adults from southern Brazil. An online questionnaire was used to gather data on mental and physical health from before and during COVID-19 social distancing. The study protocol was approved by the institutional research ethics board of the Superior School of Physical Education of the Federal University of Pelotas, Brazil (protocol: 4.093.170), and can be found elsewhere. 15 In this study, we analyzed data from the baseline of the PAMPA cohort, with fieldwork being conducted between June 22 and July 23, 2020.During the COVID-19 pandemic, cities and states in Brazil had independent legislature to delineate their own regulatory strategies to control the virus spreading. In the Rio Grande do Sul state, a controlled social distancing system was adopted, according to which each macroregion in the state was evaluated according the availability of intensive care unit (ICU) beds, incidence rates, and spreading velocity. When these indicators indicated a worse scenario in a region (e.g., faster virus spreading and less ICU beds available), social distancing restrictions were more severe. During the recruitment phase, up to 73.4% of state population were in the second highest level of social distancing restriction, in which social clubs, gyms, theaters, religious temples, commercial centers, and malls were closed to prevent gatherings.According to the latest Brazilian National Health Survey, 3 Rio Grande do Sul state has the highest prevalence of depression among all states in Brazil (13.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 11.8%e15.0%). The 2010 population census in Brazil reported 10,693,929 people living in the state. 16 To ensure a 95% confidence interval and 1.8 percentage points of margin of error, a required sample size of 1359 participants was calculated. Also, we accounted for a possible lost-to-follow-up of up to 30%. Therefore, our final sample size target was 1767 adults.The state is divided in seven macroregions of health, as follows (names are in Portuguese): Serra, Norte, Nordeste, Centro-oeste, Vales, Metropolitana, and Sul. Using data from the latest national demographic census, we divided the target sample size proportionally to the number of inhabitants in each region. Full description of sampling process can be found elsewhere. 15 We used a four-arm approach, as described elsewhere. 15 Briefly, we first contacted public and private universities within the state. A standardized email about the survey objectives and a link to access the questionnaire were sent to contacts in these institutions. Secondly, social media campaigns (i.e., Facebook® and Instagram®) were used to make the questionnaire's link available in different regions within the state. These campaigns were adjusted weekly to achieve a higher number of people in different regions, as necessary. Third, local media (e.g., local newspapers, TV, radio) were contacted by email and through social media to inform the local population about the present study. Finally, each researcher involved in this survey shared the link with the questionnaire access to personal contacts spread across the state. The recruitment phase lasted four weeks (June 22 to July 23, 2020).We developed an online-based, self-administered questionnaire to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health, as well as other health outcomes. The questionnaire was developed using the Google® Forms platform. A preliminary analysis showed that the average time to complete the survey was around 10 min, ranging from 7 to 12 min. Questions about mental health were assessed twice so it could be accessed based on different periods (before and during social distancing).Mental health was assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to identify symptoms of depression and anxiety both before and during social distancing. This 14-item scale is a simple and reliable tool valid in both community settings and primary care medical practice. 17e19 Each domain (depression and anxiety) contains seven items, which are scored between 0 and 3. Therefore, each domain has a maximum score of 21. Participants who scored less than 7 were classified as nonsymptomatic for that domain (i.e., anxiety or depression). Scores between 8 and 10 were considered as mild risk, between 11 and 14 as moderate risk, and between 15 and 21 as severe risk of depression and/or anxiety. 20 To assess the frequency of depressive and anxiety symptoms retrospectively, we asked the participants to answer all the HADS questions using the period before the COVID-19 pandemic as reference. Later, the current frequency of such symptoms was assessed considering the last week as the reference period.Questions on age, gender (male, female, other/prefer not to mention), city of residence, ethnicity (White, Black, Yellow, Mixed, Indigenous, other), conjugal situation (with or without partner), and the highest educational level achieved were assessed.We also asked participants about the diagnosis of any chronic disease based on the question used in the Brazilian Telephonebased Surveillance System for Noncommunicable Diseases. 21 Next, respondents provided an estimated current weight and height. These measures were used to calculate the body mass index (BMI) and classify the sample into the following BMI-based categories 22 : normal (<25 kg/m 2 ), overweight (25e29.9 kg/m 2 ), and obese (!30 kg/m 2 ).The impact of COVID-19 pandemic in work-related activities and economic situation were examined with the following question: ""Did social distancing affect your monthly income?"" In case of an affirmative response, participants reported whether income decreased or increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.Self-rated knowledge about the COVID-19 was accessed by the following question: ""How do you evaluate your knowledge about the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)?"" Participants could rate it as ""bad,"" ""regular,"" ""good,"" ""very good/excellent."" Attitudes toward social distancing were assessed by the following question: ""How has your daily routine at home been?"" Answering options were: ""staying at home all the time,"" ""go out only for essential things"" (e.g., buying food, go out sometimes for shopping and stretching my legs), ""go out every day for some activity,"" or ""go out every day to work or another regular activity."" The two latest alternatives were merged for analysis purposes.Changes in physical activity were established from similar questions. First, we asked participants about the weekly volume of physical activity before the social distancing period using the following question: ""Before social distancing restrictions, were you engaged in physical activity regularly?"" If the participant indicated a positive answer (i.e., ""Yes""), then the total days and duration (minutes) of physical activity were asked. 23 Further, we asked about practice of physical activity in the current week (i.e., during social distancing). Participants were categorized into two groups according to the World Health Organization's recommendation: physically inactive (less than 150 min per week) or active (150 min or more per week). 24 Data were exported from Google® Sheets to Stata 13.1 (Stata-Corp, College Station, Texas). Due to a higher number of respondents from one macroregion in the state (South, N ¼ 1247 [53.7%]), all analyses were weighted for the number of respondents in each region. Continuous data were reported as mean and standard deviation while proportions were presented as mean and 95% confidence interval (CI). The chi-squared test was used to compare the proportion of participants in each level of anxiety and depression symptoms. Scores from both domains of HADS between pre-and during the COVID-19 social distancing were compared using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures, and Bonferroni's post hoc was used as required. Univariate and multivariate Poisson regression were performed to identify the determinants of declining mental health risk during COVID-19 pandemic. All variables from univariate analyses were added in the multivariate model, and a P-value 0.20 was set to determine whether variables were maintained in the model. We adopted a P-value lower than 0.05 as the level of significance. Table 1 summarizes the sociodemographic characteristics of the final sample (n ¼ 2321). Most of participants were middle-aged (31e59 years old [54.3%]), female (76.6%), White (90.6%), and had an university-level degree (66.6%). More than half were overweight or obese (53.2%) and had at least one chronic disease (56.9%). Table S2 ). The proportion of people reporting moderate-to-severe anxiety and depression increased by 7.4 and 6.6 times since social distancing restrictions. Participants who were more likely to report worse anxiety symptoms during this period were female, aged between 18 and 30 years, had low educational achievement, and decreased monthly income since social distancing was implemented. In participants who completed secondary education or less the proportion of moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms increased from 9.7% to 51.4%, with one quarter being classified with severe symptoms.Aggravated depression symptoms were more frequent during the COVID-19 pandemic in females, younger age groups, and participants with chronic disease, as shown in Supplementary  Table S2 . Among participants with low educational achievement (i.e., up to secondary school), two out of five were classified with moderate-to-severe depression, representing a 4.6-fold increase from the pre-COVID-9 period. The negative impact of COVID-19 on monthly income was associated with higher scores of depression. Also, respondents who became physically inactive during social distancing restrictions reported higher increase in moderate-tosevere symptoms of depression (13.3x) than those who became active in the same period (5.1x). Table 3 summarizes the continuous scores from HADS both on anxiety and depression symptoms. Notwithstanding the remarkable impact of COVID-19 pandemic among all subgroups, participants with low educational level, normal BMI classification, and reduced monthly income since social distancing restrictions revealed a higher impact on anxiety symptoms than their counterparts. Similarly, females and participants with a BMI lower than 24.9 kg/m 2 were the most affected by COVID-19 regarding depressive symptoms. On the other hand, those who were classified as physically active either before or during the pandemic had better mental health indicators. Table 4 describes the determinants of aggravated mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Female sex (prevalence ratio (PR): 1.27; 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.45), presence of chronic disease (PR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.29), and decreased monthly income (PR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.28) were associated with a higher likelihood of more severe anxiety symptoms during social distancing. However, age and physical active practice (i.e., !150 min per week) were associated with less anxiety symptoms. This protective effect of physical activity was observed among those respondents who were active at both times (PR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.91) and also among those who became physically active (PR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.85) during social distancing restrictions.Determinants for worse depressive symptoms were similar to those observed for anxiety. However, those who were physically active had fewer depressive symptoms regardless of the status before the COVID-19 pandemic.To date and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that examined the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health issues in Brazil using a longitudinal design. We found that the prevalence of moderate-to-severe anxiety and depressive symptoms increased 7.4x and 6.6x, respectively, after the implementation of social distancing restrictions. Female sex, age 30 or less, diagnosed chronic disease, and acute economic strain due to the COVID-19 pandemic were identified as determinants for worse anxiety and depressive symptoms. Aggravated depressive symptoms were less likely in participants who were physically active during the social distancing restrictions, independent of physical activity status before them.Although we did not analyze specific income data, we asked participants about the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on their monthly income. A negative economic impact was reported by 45.3% (95% CI: 42.7%, 47.8%) of the respondents, who were more likely to have aggravated anxiety and depressive symptoms during the pandemic. We also found that participants aged between 18 and 30 years were more likely to have heightened anxiety and depressive symptoms than older age groups, corroborating previous findings. 11, 25 This subgroup is working age and less likely to be in an established position in their jobs. Therefore, the fear of unemployment and uncertainty about the future after COVID-19 may be responsible for the aggravated mental health. 10, 26, 27 This is similar to what was documented in previous outbreaks (i.e., Ebola and SARS). 26, 28 Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the social inequalities seen for so many years in Brazil and in other countries 29 especially regarding the access of mental health services. 30 If no action is made to mitigate mental health issues in the most vulnerable groups, the burden of mental health disorders is expected to lead to an unprecedented health crisis. 1 Some countries have estimated the prevalence of depression and other mental health disorders during COVID-19. Nevertheless, information from longitudinal studies is scarce. In Ethiopia, since the beginning of the pandemic, the number of people with depression had a threefold increase compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. 1 A recent prospective longitudinal study in the United Kingdom reported that the prevalence of clinically significant levels of mental distress rose 44% from 2018/19 to April 2020 (i.e., after 1 month of government-imposed lockdown), affecting more young and female participants. 10 In China, a study surveyed 333 people between the initial outbreak and 4 weeks after the epidemic's peak, with no difference in the prevalence of moderate-to-severe depression, anxiety, and stress. 31 We revealed that in Brazil, the number of people reporting moderate-to-severe depressive and anxiety symptoms increased 6.6x and 7.4x, respectively. This ""above average"" increase in mental distress compared to other countries may reveal the triple burden caused by health, economic, and political crises in the country. Besides, no federal agencies in Brazil imposed a lockdown or any more rigorous social distancing strategies to obligate people to stay at home. However, this was seen in the abovementioned countries, 32 where lower burden of mental health attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic was reported.We revealed that physically active participants were less likely to report mental health issues during the COVID-19 crisis, consistent with previous findings. 33 We further observed that this protective effect was independent of physical activity status before the pandemic. However, those who became inactive during this period had the same likelihood of aggravated symptoms compared to respondents who were inactive before the pandemic and sustained this behavior during it. Although social distancing restrictions may include closing gyms and sports clubs, physical activity needs to be promoted and encouraged. 34 Previous studies have reported that engaging in physical activity reduces the risk of depression and anxiety disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. 11, 35, 36 These protective effects may be associated with the increased synthesis and release of neurotransmitters 37 and neurotrophic factors 38 which may improve neurogenesis, 39 angiogenesis, 40 and neuroplasticity. 41, 42 Previous findings revealed that breaking long-lasting sitting time could reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms. 43 Then, home-based, COVID-19-safe approaches to promote physically active behavior and decrease sitting time may be crucial to reduce the burden of COVID-19 on mental health at the population level.Some limitations of our study need to be acknowledged. First, the retrospective longitudinal design may lead to recall bias. Nonetheless, there was no data from ongoing, population-level, prospective studies in south Brazil. Therefore, the study design used here was the only possibility. Also, the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 pandemic on daily activities may create a remarkable timepoint improving participants' ability to compare the moments before and during social distancing restrictions, thus reducing the likelihood of recall bias. Second, as face-to-face research was not permitted by the ethics board from our institution, a probabilistic sampling process was not possible. For example, the proportion of participants self-declared White (90.6% [95% CI: 89.0%e92.0%]) and aged 30 years or over (62.7% [95% CI: 60.2%e65.2%]) is similar to the observed in the general population of the Rio Grande do Sul state (Whites: 79%, adults aged 30 or over: 62.2%). Nevertheless, respondents with one or more academic degree is overexpressed. Data from the latest PNAD 44 revealed that 16.9% of adults aged 25 years or over had at least one academic degree, while in our sample, this proportion was 40.2% (95% CI: 37.8%e42.8%). This sampling bias was expected, since data collection was online and poorer/less schooled people have limited access to internet compared to richer/ more schooled people in Brazil. However, one should note that the COVID-19 has a stronger impact on the lower economic groups of the population; thus our results are likely underestimated. Had our sample included a higher proportion of the less schooled people, an even higher prevalence of the outcomes could be observed. Third, the questionnaire was self-administered which may be more prone to response bias. Nevertheless, as previously reported, 45 self-report scales might be useful in the current scenario, as they are usually short, easy to administer, and feasible to be used when in social distancing restrictions. Fourth, we adapted the validated HADS to assess the frequency of depressive and anxiety symptoms retrospectively. Then, although astounding, our findings need to be interpreted with caution. Lastly, although we used a retrospective design, reverse causality cannot be ruled out when interpreting our findings.In summary, we revealed a 6.6-and 7.4-fold increase in moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. Women, younger age (i.e., 18e30 years), clinically diagnosed chronic diseases, and negative economic impact from social distancing restriction were associated with a higher likelihood of aggravated mental health issues. Physical activity decreased the probability of worse depressive and anxiety symptoms at the same time point. Well-designed treatment and recovery plans for these groups need to take place urgently. If not addressed, the burden associated with depression and anxiety could be worse than the health impact from the virus itself and lead to a longer, deeper, and more uneven health crisis in Brazil.Ethical Approval was given by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Pelotas (31906920.7.0000.5313).This study was financed in part by the Coordenaç~ao de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior -Brasil (CAPES) -Finance Code 001.None declared.Supplementary data to this article can be found online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.11.013.

b968cee602e9d950a86b4dc120118553685fedb2,"Correlation between hospitalized patients' demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, and COVID-19 pandemic in Bahia, Brazil","The beginning of 2020 was marked by the emergence of a mysterious pneumonia caused by a variation of the coronavirus, after the first case was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. With the rapid increase in cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared in 2020 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a public health emergency of international interest [1] .The SARS-CoV-2 that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) arises from the RNA mutation of a virus isolated for the first time in 1937 and which initially expanded asymptomatically and with mild symptoms. However, SARS-CoV-2 is currently the pathogen that causes the most concern to the community around the world due to its high transmissibility, thus generating major impacts for health systems [1] .Faced with a still obscure and uncertain scenario, WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 and instituted essential measures to prevent and cope with the disease, which included hand hygiene with soap and water, or gel alcohol in situations where the use of soap and water was not possible. WHO also recommended the entire society to avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth, to protect the people around, when sneezing or coughing, in addition to the use of the mask and the implementation of the distance measure of at least one meter, thus avoiding crowds [1] .In Brazil, after the pandemic spread to several countries, the COVID-19 infection was declared by the Ministry of Health, on February 3, 2020, a public health emergency of national importance. This action aimed to encourage the taking of administrative measures with greater agility so that the country could begin to prepare itself to face the pandemic, whose first case of COVID-19 was notified only on the day February 26, 2020, in São Paulo [2] .Within the perspective of adopting measures that would generate less impact on the Brazilian health system, the Ministry of Health authorized and defined, through ordinance, the setting up of Field Hospitals and the implementation of specific Health Units to meet the exclusive demands of patients with COVID-19, operating in the following regulated and structured ways: as a clinical inpatient unit for patients with low-complexity respiratory symptoms and as a pulmonary ventilatory support unit, for treating cases of worsening of the patient's respiratory condition, indicating the invasive and non-invasive ventilatory support [3] .The Brazilian National Health System (Sistema Ú nico de Saúde-SUS) is one of the largest and most complex public health systems in the world and provides services ranging from a simple blood pressure assessment to a complex organ transplant. Its operation guarantees full, universal and free access for the entire Brazilian population, without discrimination.However, despite all the recommendations provided by WHO and the Ministry of Health in Brazil, by the day of September 8, 2020, COVID-19 has already infected about 27.4 million people around the globe, leading to almost 900,000 deaths. In Brazil, the second most infected country to the date, 4.1 million residents were diagnosed with COVID-19, and nearly 127,000 deaths have been estimated [4] . The most common reported symptoms associated with COVID-19 were flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever) and respiratory dysfunctions (e.g., dyspnea), while the highest number of deaths happened in elderly patients or patients with a previous comorbidity [5] .The current increase in demands for hospital admissions creates an overload in both private and public health systems, which already operate at their capacity limit, that requires a careful structuring of SUS, to promote care to the population with agility and quality, given the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the assessment and correlation of the most common variables that could influence in the risk of mortality, length of hospital stay and time from diagnosis to definitive outcome of COVID-19 have become essential to aid health care professionals in the decision-making process and to ensure that the health care services could be provided with the greatest possible safety, reliability and agility [6] .Several studies have already correlated patients' medical data and the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to detect the variables that could be useful to predict mortality risk [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , or to predict length of hospital stay [17, 18] . As stated by the systematic review of Wynants et al. [5] , age, sex, the presence of comorbidities, and a few biomarkers, such as C reactive protein, creatinine, lymphocyte count, red cell distribution width, and lactate dehydrogenase, are commonly reported as variables correlated with an increased mortality risk, while age and variables derived from computed tomography scans are reported to be more correlated with the length of hospital stay. Using data from Brazil, the work of Soares et al. [19] reported that age and shortness of breath are the variables most related to the risk of mortality from COVID-19.In this paper, we aim to complement the studies regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and provide a data exploratory analysis of the variables that could be influencing the COVID-19 pandemic in the state of Bahia, Brazil. In this sense, we aim to verify not only whether and how much patients' demographics, symptoms, and comorbidities are correlated with the risk of mortality from COVID-19, but also whether those variables are correlated with the length of hospital stay and the time from diagnosis to definitive outcome, correlation that is not much analyzed by related work. This study is useful not only to check whether the findings of related work are also valid for data collected in Brazil, but also to guide the health care professionals and the scientific community with respect to the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic in a state of Brazil.In this retrospective study, we included patients that live in the state of Bahia, Brazil, and who were diagnosed with COVID-19, following the guidance provided by WHO, between March 3, 2020 and July 29, 2020. We used the dataset provided by the Health Secretary of the State of Bahia (Secretária de Saúde do Estado da Bahia-SESAB), which included anonymized data of patients' demographics (e.g., birth date, sex, race, state of residence, municipality of residence), symptoms (e.g., sore throat, shortness of breath, fever, cough), comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression), patient record data collection (e.g., diagnosis date, symptoms start date, hospital ID, hospitalization date, length of hospital stay, severity status, pregnancy), and outcome data (e.g., whether the patient is dead, has recovered or is still under treatment, and the date of the definitive outcome). All of these data were reported by the own patients, by their families, or by the health care professionals working in the hospitals. In S1 Table, we provide the anonymized, processed dataset with hospitalized COVID-19 patients that we have used as a basis to report and discuss the results presented in this manuscript.In terms of statistical analysis, discrete variables (e.g., age, length of hospital stay, time from diagnosis to definitive outcome) were reported using mean and standard deviations metrics. Categorical variables with binary values were reported using count (n) and also the relative percentage (%). One-way Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA), Pearson correlation, and Chi-Square test were used to estimate p-values (p) between a categorical and a discrete variable, between discrete variables, and between categorical variables, respectively. We have used a default threshold of p < 0.05 to indicate that a reported result is statistically significant, and included the statistically significant variables in a multivariable regression analysis, to account for the influence that those variables might have on each other. In this case, odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and new p-values are reported. Also, we have used popular libraries in the Python programming language (e.g., pandas, numpy, statsmodels) to measure the reported metrics.As can be seen in Fig 1, the table provided by SESAB contained data of 154,868 patients that were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the state of Bahia, Brazil. However, after doing some data processing and filtering to remove patients with invalid data or that were not hospitalized, 3,896 patients remained in the dataset. An overview of the valid data collected in this work, described according to the definitive outcome of the COVID-19 patients, is shown in Table 1 .According to Table 1 , 26.8% of the hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 died from such a disease. In this case, the mean age of the hospitalized patients that died due to COVID-19 is higher than the mean age of the hospitalized patients that recovered from COVID-19 (68.8 years vs 57.7 years, p < 0.001). In terms of sex, although more male patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (2,338 males vs 1,558 females), this factor was not determined to be statistically significant to be correlated with the risk of mortality from COVID-19 (p = 0.8). Likewise, race was found to be not statistically significant to be correlated with the risk of mortality from COVID-19 (p = 0.1). With respect to the COVID-19 symptoms, cough and sore throat were the most and the less common symptoms reported by the patients. On the other hand, shortness of breath and sore throat were the only ones whose p-values were below the pre-defined threshold. In this sense, shortness of breath was more common in patients that did not survive from COVID-19 (60.7% vs 40.6%, p < 0.001). On the other hand, sore throat was the less common reported symptom for both patients that died or survived from COVID-19 (10.4% vs 15.2%, p < 0.001). Given the comorbidities found in the dataset provided by SESAB, only immunosuppression (p = 0.4) and chromosomal disorder (p = 0.7) were found to be not statistically significant for our analysis. All the remaining comorbidities, namely diabetes (26.5% vs 19.0%, p < 0.001), chronic kidney disease (6.6% vs 3.0%, p < 0.001), chronic respiratory disease (6.8% vs 4.2%, p = 0.002), and cardiovascular disease (27.3% vs 21.1%, p < 0.001) were more frequent in non-survivor patients. Among female patients, low-risk pregnancy was more frequent in recovered patients (1.7% vs 0.4%, p = 0.002), meanwhile high-risk pregnancy was not significant enough to differentiate survivor After removing the patients with invalid data (e.g., notification year prior to 2020, length of hospital stay lower than zero, age lower than zero, unknown outcome), the dataset contained a total of 118,011 patients with valid registration. Finally, we removed the patients that were not admitted to a hospital, restricting our evaluation to a final count of 3,896 patients. and non-survivor patients (p = 0.9). In this case, we note that 91.4% of the low-risk pregnants diagnosed with COVID-19 and available in our dataset have been hospitalized. Since we do not know in which month of their pregnancy these patients have been hospitalized, or whether the hospitalizations have been performed as a prevention measure to protect the patients, we believe that this high percentage of hospitalization may explain their high recovery rate. Finally, the recovered patients demanded more days of hospitalization (16.1 days vs 10.1 days, p < 0.001) and time from diagnosis to definitive outcome (24.7 days vs 17.2 days, p < 0.001) than the patients who died from COVID-19.The statistically significant variables estimated from Table 1 were included into a multivariable logistic regression analysis, whose results are reported in Table 2 . As we can see from that In this work, we are not only interested in evaluating whether or how much the collected variables are correlated to the risk of mortality from COVID-19, but we are also interested in whether those variables, collected for hospitalized patients, are correlated with the length of hospital stay, and the time from diagnosis to the definitive outcome. In Table 3 , we show a matrix with p-values estimated using one-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation for those variables.As shown in Table 3 , the relation between age, length of hospital stay and time from diagnosis to definitive outcome is statistically significant (p < 0.001). From the Pearson correlation matrix shown in Fig 2, we can see that the length of hospital stay has a moderate positive relationship (Pearson's r = 0.6) with the time from diagnosis to definitive outcome, which makes sense, since the longer the patient is hospitalized, the longer is the time to reach an outcome of death or recovery. On the other hand, a weak negative relationship was measured between age and both length of hospital stay and time from diagnosis to definitive outcome (Pearson's r = −0.1). Hence, we can see a weak indication that the lower the age of a patient, the longer the patient would stay hospitalized. We could justify that assumption following the results from Table 1 , where the mean age of the recovered patients is lower than the mean age of the dead patients (57.7 vs 68.8, p < 0.001), but the mean of both the length of hospital stay (16.1 vs 10.1, p < 0.001) and time from diagnosis to definitive outcome (24.7 vs 17.2, p < 0.001) were longer.From Table 3 , we can also see that, for a few categorical variables (e.g., race, shortness of breath, cough, and low-risk pregnancy), we can provide a valid correlation with respect to the Multivariable logistic regression was used to measure odds ratios (OR), confidence intervals (CI) and p-values for the statistically significant variables measured in Table 1 with respect to the definitive outcome of hospitalized COVIDlength of hospital stay or the time from diagnosis to definitive outcome. Since these last two variables were further determined to have a moderate positive relationship, as explained previously, from now on we will focus on the analysis of the relation between those categorical variables and the length of hospital stay, when the variable was determined to be statistically significant for both characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic.In Fig 3, we can see that the length of hospital stay is pretty similar regardless of whether a hospitalized patient reported a symptom of shortness of breath (p < 0.001). Similarly, from the box plots shown in Fig 4, we can state that an initial symptom of cough does not affect significantly the total time from diagnosis to definitive outcome of COVID-19 for the hospitalized patients (p = 0.02).In Fig 5, we can see that female patients with low-risk pregnancy stayed, on average, a slight longer time at the hospital than the female patients that were not pregnant or did not have a low-risk pregnancy (p = 0.001). Despite this fact, we recall from Table 1 , that the frequency of low-risk pregnants that recovered from COVID-19 was higher compared to the frequency of low-risk pregnants that died from COVID-19 (1.7% vs 0.4%, p < 0.001).Finally, from Fig 6, we see that race is another variable that does not have a strong relationship with the length of hospital stay, since the mean length of hospital stay is nearly the same regardless of the reported race (p < 0.001). In Table 4 , we show the results obtained with a multivariable linear regression analysis performed between the statistically significant variables measured in Table 3 and the length of hospital stay. Similarly to the result reported in Fig 2, older age (OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.96-0.99, p < 0.001) was also determined to have a weak negative relationship with the length of hospital stay. As shown in Fig 6, patients with an unknown race (OR = 18.03, 95% CI = 4.56-71.73, p < 0.001) identification had a higher length of hospital stay than the others, a fact that was captured by the multivariable regression analysis. The initial symptom of shortness of breath (p = 0.4) and a low-risk pregnancy (p = 0.1) were not estimated to be risk factors for an increased length of hospital stay. Finally, in accordance with the correlation matrix shown in Fig 2, time from diagnosis to definitive outcome (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.63-1.70, p < 0.001) has a moderate relation to the length of hospital stay.In a general sense, our results shown in the previous section point out to the fact that except for the variables age (OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.95-0.98, p < 0.001, Pearson's r = −0.1) and time from diagnosis to definitive outcome (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.64-1.71, p < 0.001, Pearson's r = 0.6), we cannot guarantee that the other measured variables of the hospitalized patients' demographics, symptoms and comorbidities can differentiate the groups of patients who had a shorter or a longer length of hospital stay. Correlation between hospitalized patients' data and COVID-19 pandemic in Bahia, Brazil Correlation between hospitalized patients' data and COVID-19 pandemic in Bahia, BrazilThe box plots for most of the statistically significant categorical variables obtained in the dataset, namely shortness of breath, cough, and race, were nearly the same regardless of the patient's race or whether the patients had the corresponding initial symptom. On the other hand, we have a weak negative relationship between age and length of hospital stay, in the sense that younger people tend to stay more time in the hospital, which may be caused due to the fact that younger patients have a higher chance to recover from COVID-19 than older patients. Moreover, the box plot of Fig 5 shows that low-risk pregnants were found to stay more time hospitalized, although that results were not measured to be statistically significant in the multivariable linear regression (Table 4 ). Regarding the pregnancy criterion, there is current evidence of low rates of maternal and neonatal mortality, as well as of Intensive Care Unit admissions associated with COVID-19 [20] .It is noteworthy that the fever symptom appears as an important indicator in the screening of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19, despite not having, in this study, a strong relationship with the length of hospital stay. Liu et al. [21] , in a research to determine the risk factors for severe COVID-19, report that fever, cough and fatigue appear as the main symptoms among the participants, with fever being the most common initial symptom (92.3%). Rivera-Izquierdo et al. [22] complement that in patients admitted for COVID-19 at Hospital Universitario Clínico San Cecilio, Spain, the most frequent clinical picture was also due to low fever (89.5%) and dry cough (80.7%), followed by general malaise (63.5%), dyspnea (61.3%) and tiredness (59.2%).With respect to the statistically significant factors that could be correlated with the mortality of COVID-19 patients, Table 1 shows that non-survivor patients had a higher mean age than survivor patients. Moreover, the frequency of non-surviving patients that reported shortness of breath as an initial symptom of COVID-19 was higher than the frequency reported by survivor patients. Finally, most of the comorbidities were more frequent in non-survivor patients. A study carried out by Zhang et al. [23] with patients admitted to Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, and with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, recorded that the majority of patients who died were male, over 60 years old, and had comorbidities. Comparing our results evaluated in the state of Bahia, Brazil, with the reported results of other regions of the world, we see that, in an other state of Brazil, namely Espírito Santo, Soares et al. [19] reported a higher mortality rate of 39.6% of the hospitalized patients, when compared to the mortality rate reported in this study (26.8%) . Moreover, similar to our results, older age, shortness of breath and the kidney disease were also estimated to be risk factors associated with the mortality from COVID-19. A more general study conducted by Souza et al. [24] accounting for 208,969 hospitalized patients in Brazil, shows that the mortality rate in this country is high considering only the hospitalized patients (41.28%), and, older age, shortness of breath, the presence of comorbidities, and the ventilation requirement were more associated with the mortality of those patients. Looking at the results obtained in another country, the work of Imam et al. [12] reported that only 15.3% of the hospitalized patients in Michigan, United States, did not survive from COVID-19. While that mortality rate is lower than the ones estimated in Brazil, older age and comorbidities were again measured to be risk factors associated with the mortality from COVID-19. Similar results were reported in a more general analysis performed with data collected from 154 hospitals distributed in 13 states of the United States [25] . Using data collected in Wuhan, China, Cheng et al. [26] evaluated that 16.1% of the hospitalized patients died from COVID-19, and the kidney disease was determined to be one of main risk factor associated with the mortality of those patients.Finally, we have analyzed whether pairs of combined variables (e.g., fever + cough, diabetes + cardiovascular disease) could influence in the risk of mortality, length of hospital stay and time from diagnosis to definitive outcome of COVID-19. However, the obtained p-values were higher than the default threshold.As threats to the validity of this work, we can state that all the results available in the dataset provided by SESAB were reported by the own patients, their families or the healthcare professionals working in the hospitals. Nevertheless, we have used the official dataset provided by the government of the state of Bahia, in Brazil, which further reinforces the relevance of this work. Moreover, as shown in Fig 1, we performed a careful data validation to remove outliers or patients with invalid data, restricting our analysis for valid hospitalized patients. Again, to favor openness and reproducibility, we provide the anonymized dataset as supporting information of this manuscript.COVID-19 is affecting millions of people around the world, with a mortality rate of about 2-3% of all the infected patients. Due to the ease of spread of this disease, health systems are challenged to guarantee universal access to their healthcare services, while handling the high demands that may overload their capacity limit. In this sense, we have provided, in this work, a retrospective cohort study with 3,896 patients of COVID-19 that have been hospitalized in the state of Bahia, Brazil, in order to assist our health care systems with respect to an analysis of which variables could influence in the mortality rate, length of hospital stay, and time from diagnosis to definitive outcome of COVID-19. This data exploratory analysis is fundamental to aid these organizations in the decision-making process, enabling them to improve their services to the infected population. Therefore, we could estimate that older age, presence of shortness of breath, and chronic kidney disease were the variables associated with an increased risk of mortality from COVID-19. On the other hand, the presence of sore throat and a higher length of hospital stay seems to not increase the risk of mortality from COVID-19. Moreover, only younger age and a higher time from diagnosis to definitive outcome were the variables associated with a higher length of hospital stay.For future work, since the COVID-19 is a recent disease and the pandemic is still active, with new patients being hospitalized every day, one could estimate the relation between the evaluated variables for a larger number of hospitalized patients, to see whether new correlations arise in an increased cohort population. Moreover, we aim to further assist the health systems in their decision-making process by developing a new technological solution to predict length of hospital stay given the patients' demographics, symptoms and comorbidities.Supporting information S1 ",Brazil,abstract,2020-12-14,12
1c03dfe4aeca291135642de7218eeaf66c3029a4,"Epidemiology and Infection From the Field Two hundred days of COVID-19 in São Paulo State, Brazil","Two hundred days after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Brazil, the epidemic has rapidly spread in metropolitan areas and advanced throughout the countryside. We followed the temporal epidemic pattern at São Paulo State, the most populous of the country, the first to have a confirmed case of COVID-19, and the one with the most significant number of cases until now. We analysed the number of new cases per day in each regional health department and calculated the effective reproduction number (R t ) over time. Social distance measures, along with improvement in testing and isolating positive cases, general population mask-wearing and standard health security protocols for essential and non-essential activities, were adopted and impacted on slowing down epidemic velocity but were insufficient to stop transmission.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in Brazil on 25 February 2020, in São Paulo [1] . The most populous city of Latin America was the route for COVID-19 importation, mainly from the USA and Italy [2] . It took 17 days for Brazil to reach a hundred cases, mainly reported in the capitals highly connected by airports and with an intensive flux of people. Two hundred days after the first confirmed case, the epidemic rapidly spreads across the country, and the disease advances through the interior.São Paulo implemented state-wide quarantine measures quite early in the epidemic course. On 24 March, the government adopted a social distance recommendation for all people associated with closing trade and non-essential services. The decree suggested that people's movement should be limited to the immediate needs for food and health care. Despite the enforces, adherence to safety protocols was more significant in the capital, and COVID-19 took the inner route in São Paulo State [3] . Two patterns of disease dispersion were described by Fortaleza et al. [4] : one by contiguity, in which the virus spreads through areas of conurbation, and another hierarchical (long-distance spread through elementary spatial structures, such as highways, to cities with several degrees of connectivity).São Paulo State is divided into 17 health departments with respect to epidemiological control, each one represented by a major city: Araraquara, Araçatuba, Baixada Santista, Barretos, Bauru, Campinas, Franca, São Paulo Metropolitan Area, Marília, Piracicaba, Presidente Prudente, Registro, Ribeirão Preto, São João da Boa Vista, São José do Rio Preto, Sorocaba and Taubaté. COVID-19 was introduced in different moments and behaved in different ways in each one of these Regional Health Departments (DRS, in Portuguese). We aimed to study COVID-19 advance in all these regions by analysing new confirmed cases per day (after the first case of COVID-19 in Brazil) and calculating the effective reproduction number (R t ) of SARS-CoV-2 over time. Also, daily new cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) and its R t number were estimated as an alternative way to follow the temporal evolution of the disease in a country still struggling to increase testing capacity [5] .Since 27 May, São Paulo State adopted a plan of quarantine measures ('Plano São Paulo'), which can be more restrictive or more flexible, considering the growth rate of COVID-19 cases and deaths, and bed occupancy rates in each DRS. All cities belonging to a DRS are ruled by the same quarantine measures, which were called phases. Phase 1 (red phase) is considered a contamination phase, in which the rates of spread of the disease are high and, the capacity of the health system is close to its limit, with permission only for essential services. Phase 2 (orange phase) is considered an attention phase, with the possibility of some services opening. For commerce, limit to maximum occupancy 20% of the location's capacity, with reduced hours: 4 h in a row on all days of the week or 6 h in a row on 4 days of the week, always adopting standard and sector-specific protocols. Food courts are still banned in this phase. Phase 3 (yellow) is considered a controlled phase, with some flexibilisation. For example, commerce may open with maximum occupancy limited to 40% of total capacity and reduced hours (8 h). Finally, phase 4 (green), a partial opening phase, in which all services are allowed to open, respecting the limit of 60% of capacity and maintaining all specific protocols. Bars, restaurants, beauty salons and barbershops will only be open from phases 3 and 4, yellow and green.We monitored the number of SARI and confirmed cases of COVID-19, over time, for each Regional Health Department of São Paulo State, Brazil [6] . These permitted us to calculate the effective reproduction number (R t ) for COVID-19 in each of these regions and evaluate the evolution of the epidemic using the methodology proposed by Wallinga and Lipsitch [7] . Unfortunately, data from Brazil does not distinguish imported cases from local cases, making it inviable to use more recent methodologies to estimate R t [8] . Since 20 March, community transmission of COVID-19 was declared for the whole country, impacting notifications.Data were obtained from the national database SIVEP-Gripe, which registers all severe hospitalised cases of SARI and identifies confirmed COVID-19 cases, and covers the period from the date of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 (25 February) until 200 days after. A nowcasting procedure [9] was performed to correct delay in notifications that span 40 days before the last case. The last week was ignored in the analysis. After that, the data were smoothed using a moving average with a window of 7 days. Figure 1 shows the time evolution of new cases, and R t for both COVID-19 confirmed cases and SARI. The first case of COVID-19 was reported in the DRS of São Paulo Metropolitan Area on 25 February. For SARI, we reported the cases beginning on 15 March, when a change of protocol was done to englobe COVID-19 on SARI notifications. The results obtained for COVID-19 are shown in full lines and for SARI in dashed lines. Vertical lines have been marked to signal the dates for changes in social distancing protocols and trade functioning. The 24 March (purple vertical line) represents the generalised quarantine for the state as a whole. From 27 May on, the São Paulo plan was implemented. Coloured lines indicate the phase in which each DRS belongs. Phases 1, 2 and 3 are represented by the colours red, orange and yellow. None of the DRS was in the reopening phase (phase 4, green) at the end of this study.One can notice the difference of scales for COVID-19 confirmed cases and SARI notifications to follow the disease's spatial-temporal dynamics in each location. The confirmed cases of COVID-19 struggle with the country's capacity to acquire quick tests, additionally to the shortages of molecular testing supplies. SARI cases can vary from twice as high as COVID-19 cases (e.g. Franca and Registro) to four times higher (e.g. Araquara and Barretos). Grotto et al. [5] showed that molecular diagnosis increased in São Paulo State over the epidemiological weeks, but it does not match the much higher increase in the number of cases, challenging diagnostic capacity and, therefore, accurate and timely health surveillance.The trends in increasing or decreasing epidemic velocity are captured by both measures SARI and COVID-19 (see R t curves). Oscillations can be clearly observed on the COVID-19 curve of new cases.Our results confirm the spatial-temporal dispersion of COVID-19 over São Paulo State described by Fortaleza et al. [3, 4] . Higher numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases are seen earlier in São Paulo Metropolitan Area DRS, accompanied by conurbation areas, such as Campinas DRS and Baixada Santista DRS. On 27 May, they belonged to the red phase, indicating high rates of disease spreading and high hospital bed occupancy rates. This is evidence of the earlier introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in these regions and may explicit the contiguity model of disease dispersion.It is interesting to highlight that the social distance measures and improvement in testing, mask-wearing and standard health security protocols, were adopted and impacted slowing down epidemic velocity in all DRS, but in different moments. In São Paulo Metropolitan Area, protocol adherence was greater in March and April, as we can see the R t 's reduction over time. In the countryside, rules were not strictly followed in this very first moment because the number of cases and deaths were still not so alarming, giving the population a false security sensation. São Paulo State general quarantine started on 24 March and was extended until 27 May, when the São Paulo plan started. Over this period, all DRS showed R t values close to 1, but only sometimes below 1. This was not sufficient to stop the epidemic, as the number of confirmed cases kept growing, but was able to slow down dissemination.When taking special attention to more recent R t values (June, for instance), we can see the interior of São Paulo State is at a critical phase of the epidemic. Inner regions such as Marilia, Araraquara and Barretos DRS show R t values sometimes much higher than 1. Bauru shows similar behaviour. An increase in the R t in these locations is mostly due to more recent disease introduction, not following social distancing measures, and local issues on testing and isolating positive cases. This scenario is not compatible with a plan of reopening commerce and industry activities, which have been induced by some mayors who insist on questioning the São Paulo State quarantine plans.Finally, we observed that we can follow COVID-19 epidemic behaviour by following SARI notifications. Obviously, there is a great difference on the scale of numbers. As commented before, this might be secondary to a lack of diagnostic power and a delay in the diagnosis of confirmed cases. Anyhow, as we can see in Figure 1 , in all DRS, full lines and dashed lines run together and represent remarkably similar curves. A low-to-medium income country with serious structural issues, such as Brazil, looking at SARI incidence and how it increased in different areas might represent an alternative way to estimate the real epidemic's numbers.Similar studies estimated R t considering imported and local transmission cases because the first one seems to be particularly important for a newly introduced disease [10, 11] . Such methodology cannot be applied to Brazil's data since this information is not captured in the SARI mandatory notification form. However, Gabriel Berg de Almeida et al. the obtained R t values at the different phases of the epidemic are in the range observed in other studies [10, 11] . Also, as in other countries, slowing down on epidemic spreading was observed when the non-pharmacological measures were introduced, but it was not enough to control the epidemic, differently from many countries. Local issues on epidemic control are still a challenge for Brazilian studies. Delays in notifications, poorly computerised systems, difficulties in contact tracing, open-source data and political and economic fragilities are some. Finally, lock-down was never performed in any location of São Paulo state.Studying R t values and relating to the number of confirmed new cases and SARI cases permitted us to evaluate quarantine plans and their impact on disease spreading over time. Along with universal mask-wearing and testing and isolating positive cases, social distance measures were able to diminish epidemic velocity, impacting the reduction of R t . Still, they were insufficient to stop transmission, as the R t was mostly established over one, and the number of cases kept growing. Today, after 200 days since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Brazil, the São Paulo State situation is still alarming. Although many regions started showing a reduction in the number of new cases since August, R t on most of these locations is greater than 1, making it clear new strategies on public health and epidemic control urges.",Brazil,abstract,2020-12-02,12
f38dd75910973f49a700b1ab43a3840871260737,14:1152; www.ecancer.org,"Cancer is a serious public health problem worldwide, and, in Peru, represents the primary cause of mortality [1] . The associated disability caused by cancer and the high social cost constitutes a challenge for our debilitated healthcare system, which must also overcome geographic and cultural barriers, population growth and migration and the associated changes in the prevalence and distribution of risk factors, several of which are related to low socioeconomic levels [2] . In this context, Peru has established strategies to control the disease and has set as a goal the reduction of advanced cancer in its population [2] [3] [4] . This includes interventional cytopathology as an effective, simple and economical technique with minimal complications, though it requires adequate training in cytopathology and the necessary equipment [5, 6] .In spite of its virtues and the growing interest in interventional cytopathology evidenced in several national publications [6] [7] [8] [9] , today's cytopathology laboratory faces a great challenge: functioning during the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, which has brought down healthcare systems around the world [10] .Healthcare professionals have a high risk of infection due to contact with infected people with or without symptoms, limited availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), inadequate healthcare service infrastructure to confront infectious outbreaks of this magnitude and the precariousness the foregoing in low-and middle-income countries. In this context, laboratory staff, including interventional cytopathologists, are in a high-risk group [10] [11] [12] [13] .Conscious of the importance of continuing with diagnostic work, in this article, the recommendations made in the literature are analysed to guarantee correct functioning in the area of interventional cytopathology so that oncology cytodiagnosis is prioritised for the benefit of the patient, but also for the care and health of laboratory staff.A literature review was carried out on PubMed, SCOPUS and LILACS, using the terms 'fine needle biopsy', 'cancer', 'COVID-19' and 'biosafety', in both English and Spanish. The bibliographic search was carried out by the authors, who, in virtual form, selected, analysed, discussed and wrote the recommendations.Interventional cytopathology is a branch of anatomical pathology in which the cytopathologist carries out minimally invasive procedures on palpable masses or masses identified by ultrasound, using a fine calibre needle (fine needle) to obtain the sample and issue a cytological diagnosis. There are two variants on the technique: fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, and biopsy without aspiration, also known as the fine needle capillary (FNC) biopsy technique. Both have a high degree of diagnostic accuracy and in some cases are used together to complement each other, improving their validity [14, 15] . Interventional cytopathology traces its history to Arabic medicine, with previous contributions from Dudgeon and Patrick in the United Kingdom, Martin and Ellis in the United States and Zajdela, Zajicek and Franzen in the Netherlands [16] . In Peru, it started formally in the final decade of the last century with Columbie, Somocurcio and collaborators routinely using FNA to approach thyroid gland tumours [17] . The diffusion of this procedure to other hospitals in Lima and the provinces crept forward slowly. In the oncology space, in 2007, the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases in Lima included the diagnostic protocol for head and neck tumours and subsequently for other neoplasms. Four years later, Bardales and Abad implemented FNA and FNC in the Northern Regional Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, using predominantly 27 and 25G needles. This experiment constituted the first national publication on this matter [7] . To date, interventional cytopathology has been adopted in other institutions for early diagnosis in oncology, staging, evaluation of the response to treatment and even as a screening test [5, 6] .FNA and FNC are techniques carried out with a fine needle which reduces the presence of haematic matter, which often makes diagnosis difficult. In both variations (FNA and FNC), the sample obtained remains in the needle, with the exception of the cysts, to then be ejected with the help of a syringe onto a microscope slide [14, 15, 18] . For the purposes of biosafety within the current pandemic, this last step holds the greatest risk due to the generation of aerosols and the possibility of infection [12] . Once the sample has been spread on the slides, they must immediately be fixed in 96% alcohol for subsequent and definitive staining. The sample obtained can also be used to prepare a cell block, immunocytochemistry, genetic study and flow cytometry, among others [13, 19] .This technique and its benefits are captured in different articles. It is simple, outpatient, rapid, safe, economical and has high diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 80%-100% and specificity around 99%) [7, 8] . It is reproducible with minimal complications, with adequate staff training for those performing the procedure, processing the sample and interpreting the results being the most important condition for its success. An adequately trained cytopathologist can also carry out immediate assessments on the quality of samples obtained using rapid staining to avoid unsatisfactory results, saving time in the therapeutic decision-making process [14, 15, 18, 19] .The disadvantages of the technique are minimal; however, they must be considered. From the point of view of the procedure, although bleeding is rare, localised and easily controlled, it should be borne in mind, particularly in patients with clotting disorders. Communication with the clinic should be constant and fluid to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the interventional cytopathology [14, 18, 19] .SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current pandemic, which in Peru, on the date of this writing, reports more than 525,000 cases and 26,000 deaths with a mortality rate of 4.96% [20, 21] . The pathophysiology, and clinical and therapeutic behaviour of COVID-19 are still not well established. However, the principle modes of infection have been identified, and this knowledge has been fundamental in designing adequate prevention and biosafety strategies [10, 22, 23] . The illness spreads through the respiratory secretions of an infected person by coughing, sneezing or speaking; it is known that the virus's main point of entry is respiratory, followed by the oral and conjunctival mucosae [12, 13] .Regarding the source of the samples and their level of virulence, these have been classified as high and low risk. Sources considered high risk are those from the respiratory tract, such as sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs, broncho-alveolar lavages, pleural fluid, as well as conjunctival secretions and any specimen obtained with a fine needle, rubbing or coming from a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient [12, 24, 25] . The elimination time of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the samples of infected patients remains partially unknown, hence the importance of personal protection and correct processing of the specimen [12] .Interventional cytopathology has an important role in cancer, not only in the diagnosis of patients with palpable and non-palpable tumours, but also in staging, evaluating recurrence, progression and monitoring of the disease, as well as the use of diagnostic cytology in planning a surgical procedure and the radicality of same. In summary, it is a fundamental pillar for making management decisions. It can also provide a definitive diagnosis, supported in the clinical context with imaging and auxiliary studies. Flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, molecular analysis and genetic studies increase the diagnostic value of the technique [7, 15, 19] .The technique has demonstrated its virtues as summarised in Table 1 . The previously known advantages of this minimally invasive procedure are reinforced in the context of the pandemic, such as, for example: speed in scheduling the procedure; low or minimal costs (no need for preparatory exams, surgery, instruments, special equipment or nursing staff); the patient usually easily agrees to the procedure when it is explained to them that it is fast, safe, largely painless, outpatient, minimally traumatic and essentially without complications. Furthermore, sample processing is rapid, and a second sample can be taken should the first prove insufficient [26] .In the current health context, the discussion focuses on risks the procedure poses to the cytopathologist. In cases of necessity, and when its utility and advantages outweigh the risks, it will have to be performed under optimal biosafety conditions [24] . The evidence shows that it reduces the number of unnecessary surgeries, in many cases eliminating the need for intraoperative biopsies, and shortens the waiting time for results, enabling earlier therapeutic interventions [15, 17, 19, 26] . During this pandemic, the importance of interventional cytopathology as a diagnostic procedure is reinforced.The arrival of COVID-19 in our country and the world has changed the manner in which we act and work. The potential presence of the virus in cytology samples has forced us to adopt strict biosafety measures, starting with the workers and their duties. Considering that the current situation requires the presence of the minimum necessary number of staff in a work area, interventional cytopathology procedures should include the cytopathologist responsible for taking the sample, and support staff charged with logistics, moving, staining and technical processes, all adequately trained [15, 24] .Staff should use full PPE which includes: N95 (or higher) mask, disposable gown with long sleeves, gloves (preferably nitrile), surgical cap, boots, face shield and safety glasses. Before and after the procedure, it is important to wash hands with soap and water. Correctly wearing and removing PPE is also important [11] [12] [13] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] and should be carried out in an area designed for this purpose [23] .Interventional cytopathology procedures are carried out in accordance with a plan and previous evaluation of the patient's clinical history by the cytopathologist. To this end, it is important that the study request includes the relevant clinical data and justification for the study. The COVID-19 status of the patient must be specified, indicating whether they are positive, suspected or negative. In emergency or controversial cases, multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended to avoid unnecessary exposure [13] .The patients should wear a mask, preferably surgical, throughout the entire procedure [23] , except in cases wherein the lesion is found in the oral cavity. They should be admitted alone; if this is not possible, a member of healthcare staff from the same establishment, who will be adequately protected, will accompany them. The procedure should be carried out in an environment specific to this purpose, ventilated and with adequate illumination [12, 23, 24] . We recommend a checklist of the materials used during the procedure, including signed informed consent. The chosen technique depends upon the operator. In the bibliographic review, we did not find any evidence about the level of protection, favouring FNA versus FNC, nor the number of samples to take (passes) or the number of slides to prepare. In our experience, we suggest minimising the number of passes (three or four), and designating one for use as a sample for the cell block. The critical point is in the expulsion of the sample, pointing the bevel of the needle downwards and in contact with the slide to minimise aeration of the sample [15] . Some authors recommend that, after piercing, the sample be transferred to the laboratory to be processed in a Class II biosafety cabinet [15, 25] . If this is not possible, an alternative is proposed by the Indian Academy of Cytologists, who suggest that expulsion of the material from the needle should be gentle and that the cytopathologist, wearing full PPE, should maintain the greatest distance possible whilst manipulating the sample [23] , followed by immediate fixation in 96% alcohol and staining with Papanicolaou or hematoxylin eosin [22] . Another option is the use of a system of physical barriers during the expulsion and extension process (Figure 1) . In this context, it is prudent to not carry out immediate evaluations, especially in the same puncture location [23, 24, 27] . The recommendation is to move the already fixed sample to the laboratory to colour the slide, assess the quality and give a preliminary assessment.On finishing the procedure, the equipment and the surfaces that have been in contact with the sample and the patient must be cleaned and disinfected [28] . Afterwards, all disposable material, including the PPE, should be thrown out in a container with a bio-hazard disposal bag [29] . The reusable equipment, such as the safety glasses and visor, should be disinfected or thrown away according to the biosafety rules of each institution [28, 29] . In cases involving patients who have tested positive for COVID-19, the procedure should be scheduled for the end of the shift to minimise the risk of infection. Ideally, only a cell block should be performed, and the sample manipulated in a Class II biosafety cabinet [29] .The cytological report would be prepared in a conventional form and according to the international recommendations for each anatomical region.The health strategies designed to combat this pandemic and the need to continue supporting patients with cancer has forced us to implement adequate biosafety measures for the cytology laboratory and the interventional area to continue functioning. The literature recommends continuing with interventions in necessary cases, such as those patients with oncological diseases and in which interventional cytology is fundamental for decision making [13, 22, 23, 24] . To that effect, and considering that currently the majority of fresh biological samples are potentially infected, the infection routes and high virulence of SARS-CoV-2, as well as its survival on surfaces is proven [12, 13, 27, 28] , we should replace the premise of 'correct and early diagnosis', with 'correct and opportune diagnosis', prioritising the fixation of the sample in alcohol as a fundamental step to inactivate the virus and protect the laboratory staff. • Healthcare professional older than 60 or with co-morbidities should avoid working.• Scheduled shift work and/or staggered shifts.• Conserve minimal social distancing of 1.5 m.• The study request should include complete clinical information and indicate whether the patient is COVID-19 positive, suspected or negative. • Positive or suspected COVID-19 patients should be scheduled at the end of the shift to avoid contaminating the work area.Wash hands with soap and water before and after the procedure. • Staff should use full PPE: N95 or higher mask, long sleeved gown, gloves (preferably nitrile), surgical cap, boots, face shield and safety glasses.The procedure should be carried out in a ventilated environment, and whenever possible the patient should be admitted alone. • The patient should wear a surgical mask throughout the entire procedure. • Whenever possible, limit the number of samples obtained (one of them for the cell block).• Expulsion of the material from the needle should be gentle, with the bevel pointing down and in contact with the slide, and with the greatest distance possible during preparation for extension.Carry out evaluations immediately on fresh samples only if it is necessary and fix the slide in 96% alcohol.On finishing, the equipment, physical environment and surfaces in contact with the sample and the patient must be cleaned and disinfected.The cytological report will be produced in a conventional form. • Tell the appropriate person about any staff contact with a patient with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, or if there have been any technical complications or problems with the PPE during the procedure.Ideally, it is recommended that the technical processing of the sample be performed in a Class II biosafety cabinet.Measures should include strict biosafety procedures which include personal protection using adequate equipment (PPE), frequent hand washing, correct hygiene practices, properly scheduled shift work and refreshment breaks should be minimal and staggered in order to avoiding overcrowding. To reduce contact between people, limiting to strictly necessary staff for both sample collection and processing, and they should keep a minimum social distance of 1.5 metres [24, 25, 27] . It is recommended that this distance also be applied to the pathology offices, trying wherever possible to have only one person per office. It is also important that all staff who participate in interventions are trained, and that they follow the applicable biosafety measures in each laboratory [12, 13, 27] . Table 2 gives a summary of the recommendations.Interventional cytopathology should continue as a functioning area, but with all the means necessary for the biosafety of the staff. This includes one adequate environment for the procedure and another for processing; use of complete PPE; equipment for the technique; trained staff and permanent communication with the treating doctor.Any member of the interventional cytopathology team who has had extended contact with a patient having a suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, or has been potentially exposed to the virus during the procedure or preparation of the sample, must communicate this immediately to management and Occupational Health and/or Epidemiology to establish the procedure to follow in accordance with the norms of the health establishment. In cases of infection in the community, the protocols, which have already been established, will be followed.The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated to the entire world, mainly to low-and middle-income countries, the shortages in medical practices, inadequate biosecurity protocols and the scarcity of materials and teams. These deficiencies should not limit continued care, particularly for patients with oncological diseases. The area of interventional cytopathology for all the aforementioned advantages must reinforce its role in the diagnostic process, adapting itself to the so-called 'new normal' for the benefit of the patients. It is also very important to maximise the biosafety protocols to protect the health of the healthcare workers, a fundamental mainstay for continued aid.",Peru,abstract,2020-12-07,12
275f10968fa781eb4de7041a1746edc0ad2a13ad,"Oxygen saturation as a predictor of mortality in hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 in a public hospital in Lima, Peru","a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111In December 2019, the city of Wuhan, China, became the center of an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] . The cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly throughout China and other countries and the outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Most patients with COVID-19 only experience mild symptoms, but some develop a more severe disease that requires hospitalization. Approximately 14.2% to 30% of in-patients are further admitted to the ICU, primarily for mechanical ventilation [2, 3] . The mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients ranges from 13.2% to 28.3%; with the majority of reports coming from China and United States of America (USA) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, very little information is available regarding in-hospital mortality and its prognostic factors in Latin America [8, 9] .From March 6, 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was reported in Peru, up to July 22, 2020, there have been 366,550 reported cases and 17,455 deaths (Case fatality rate: 4.76%) [10] . In order to mitigate the pandemic impact, the Peruvian Ministry of Health took numerous measures, like declaring a state of national emergency, designating hospitals exclusively for COVID-19 care, telemedicine implementation, increasing diagnostic testing with serological rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and recommending treatments involving drugs with limited clinical evidence, like ivermectin. Despite these interventions, Peru is among the top ten countries with the highest number of reported cases worldwide with a total excess of deaths of 149% compared to recent years [11] .In order to understand the demographic and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Peru, as well as to identify prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality, we conducted a retrospective cohort study at a referral teaching hospital in Lima, Peru. Our goal was to identify prognostic factors that would allow for the design of future strategies to optimize the current management of COVID-19 patients in limited resource settings.A retrospective cohort study was conducted. We reviewed paper medical records of adult patients with COVID-19 admitted at Hospital Cayetano Heredia (HCH), a tertiary care referral hospital in the city of Lima, Peru which is at sea level. This public hospital serves approximately three million people, most of them of low-socioeconomic status and including a large number of immigrants, both Peruvians from rural areas and Venezuelan immigrants. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the hospital implemented 241 beds for COVID-19 care, including 23 ICU beds. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Hospital Cayetano Heredia (Approval code: 059-2020). Permission was granted to review all available records on the archive of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patient consent was not required as data gathered did not contain patient identifiable information.Confirmed COVID-19 cases by a positive test for SARS-CoV-2, as well as probable cases based on clinical presentation and imaging, were included. Laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 included either positive IgM and/or IgG in serologic RDT, or molecular testing using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis.The paper medical records were archived after patient discharge, transfer or death. We reviewed all medical records that were available at HCH archive from March 29 to June 11, 2020; data on patients that were hospitalized by the latter date were not included as the medical records were still in use. The information was collected using an electronic data collection form created on the Open Data Kit (ODK) Collect platform (Get ODK Inc., California, USA). Patient information included demographics, comorbidities, vital signs on admission, laboratory results, and hospitalization outcomes: length of stay, ICU admission, discharge, or death. Patients were excluded from the study if they were transferred to another facility or if they left the hospital against medical advice (AMA). Obesity was not determined by measuring weight and height, but rather by the patient's self-reported weight and height or by treating physician's criteria. Tachypnea was defined as �22 breaths per minute, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined using the pulse oximetry saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (SaO 2 /FiO 2 ) ratio threshold of <235.Statistical analysis was performed using Stata SE 16.1 (StataCorp., Texas, USA). Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables as medians with interquartile range (IQR). Comparisons were made between COVID-19 patients who were discharged from hospital or died by bivariate analysis: the Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used for categorical variables while the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for continuous variables, where a 2-sided p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Hazard ratios (HR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression to assess the association between baseline factors at admission and in-hospital mortality. Multivariate Cox regression model was constructed to evaluate the association of demographic characteristics, comorbidities and SaO 2 on admission with in-hospital mortality; variables were chosen via forward stepwise selection by statistical significance in the bivariate analysis and clinical relevance. Additionally, a secondary analysis was performed to include tachypnea on admission (replacing SaO 2 ) in the multivariate Cox regression model for in-hospital mortality. The proportional hazard assumptions were checked using Schoenfeld residuals.A total of 373 medical records of adult patients with COVID-19 admitted at HCH were identified; four patients were excluded as they were transferred or left AMA (Fig 1) . Of the 369 patients included in the analysis, 241 (65.31%) were male and the median age was 59 years (IQR: 49-68). Most patients (68.56%) had at least one comorbidity: obesity (42.55%), diabetes mellitus (21.95%) and hypertension (21.68%). A total of 278 (75.34%) were confirmed COVID-19 cases, 250 (89.93%) by a positive serological RDT, 16 (5.75%) by a positive RT-PCR, and 12 (4.32%) by both methods. The median duration of symptoms prior to hospitalization was 7 days (IQR: 5-10) ( Table 1) .Respiratory and heart rates were elevated on admission, with a median of 28 breaths and 108 beats per minute (IQR: 25-32 and 96-118, respectively). Tachypnea was present in 91.27%. Additionally, SaO 2 on admission was generally low with a median of 87% (IQR: 77-92), and more than a quarter of the patients (28.46%) were admitted with SaO 2 below 80%. The leukocyte count was elevated (11,565 cells/mm 3 , IQR: 8,260-15,270), and 76.47% of patients had leukocytosis with associated relative lymphopenia (<10% of the leukocyte count). Laboratory parameters of severe COVID-19, such as C-reactive protein (median 96 mg/dL, IQR: 48-192) and lactate dehydrogenase (median 469.5 U/L, IQR: 356-658) were also elevated. Most patients (72.63%) required high-flow oxygen therapy (FiO 2 �0.36); which included 226 (61.25%) that required use of a non-rebreather (NRB) mask at 15 L/min. Only 10.18% of patients on a NRB mask entered the ICU. Additionally, 67.21% of patients developed ARDS by SaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio during hospitalization. The median hospital stay before discharge was 8 days (IQR: 5-12), with death generally occurring on day 5 of hospitalization (IQR: 2-8). For discharged patients, the median length of stay was inversely proportional to SaO 2 values on admission: 7 days (IQR: 4-10) for SaO 2 �90%, 9.5 days (IQR: 6-13.5) for SaO 2 89-85%, 10.5 days (IQR: [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] for SaO 2 84-80%, and 22 days (IQR: 17.5-22.5) for SaO 2 <80% (p <0.001).One half of patients (183, 49.59%) died during hospitalization. Significant differences were observed in the proportion of patients aged �60 years and with comorbidities, mainly obesity and hypertension, with higher frequencies in the deceased group. The SaO 2 value on admission was lower in deceased patients compared to discharged patients (78% vs. 91%, p <0.001). This difference was maintained for each SatO 2 category and was also constant between different age groups (Fig 2) . The proportion of ARDS on admission or developed during hospitalization was greater among deceased participants. Lower absolute lymphocyte counts, higher white blood cell counts, and higher levels of C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase were found among deceased participants.Predictive factors of in-hospital mortality were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Bivariate analysis found that all SaO 2 categories <90% on admission were associated with a hazard mortality from 1.93 (95%CI: 1.07-3.49) to 9.13 (95%CI: 5.50-15.14) times higher compared to SaO 2 �90%. Survival analysis based on SaO 2 categories was plotted using Kaplan-Meier curves (Fig 3) . In the bivariate analysis, age �60 years (cHR 2.83; 95%CI: 2.03-3.93) and hypertension (cHR 1.63; 95%CI: 1.18-2.26) were also associated with in-hospital mortality. In the multivariate analysis, after adjusting for male sex, age �60 years and comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, and hypertension), SaO 2 values of less than 90% correlated independently with in-hospital mortality, presenting 1.86 (95%CI: 1.02-3.39), 4.44 (95%CI: 2.46-8.02) This study serves as the first report of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Peru. Unlike other published cohorts, our study presents data from a middle-income country in Latin America, that prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic faced the challenges of a fragmented healthcare system, overcrowding of hospitals, and poor health expenditure (5% of the gross domestic product) [12] . Our primary care system is deficient in infrastructure and resources and so far has been unable to play a leading role in patient care during this pandemic [13, 14] . Our findings should be interpreted within this context. Our study population shares similar characteristics with other cohorts [15, 16] . The most frequent comorbidities were obesity, diabetes mellitus and hypertension, all of them associated with severe illness and/or mortality in patients with COVID-19 [17] . There was a higher frequency of obesity in the deceased group, which is consistent with previous reports, where obesity was found to be a risk factor for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation [18] . Also, certain conditions associated with obesity, like diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, where previously shown to have higher mortality in patients with COVID-19 [19] . Therefore, the presence of these comorbidities contribute to a higher demand of ICU care among hospitalized patients. Unfortunately, the Peruvian public healthcare system was not prepared to satisfy this demand, with only 0.2 ICU beds for every 10,000 inhabitants in Peru at the beginning of the pandemic [20] .One of the most striking findings of our study is the elevated in-hospital mortality; 49.6%. This mortality rate is much higher than in other middle-and high-income countries like China and USA, between 13.2% and 28.3% [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . The same is true for other middle-income Latin American countries, like Brazil and Mexico, with in-hospital mortality between 16.9 and 21.9% [8, 9] . In contrast, a similar mortality rate (42.8%) among hospitalized patients was reported in Honduras, where the median age of fatal COVID-19 cases was 62 years [21] . We have not found reports of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 from low-income countries. Interestingly, unpublished data suggests that mortality from COVID-19 in private hospitals in Lima would not differ from high-income countries. Therefore, the higher mortality in our cohort from a public hospital could be associated with economic and social barriers for access to healthcare in Peru, as well as the amount of resources available for inpatient care [22] .The degree of hypoxemia (principally SaO 2 <85%) on admission was independently associated with in-hospital mortality in our cohort. Hypoxemia on admission as a predictor of inhospital mortality was previously described in cohorts from China and USA [6, 7, 23] . However, to our knowledge, this is the first study from Latin America to identify a similar association. Petrilli et al. found SaO 2 <88% on admission was associated with mortality, although the proportion of patients with hypoxemia was lower than in our cohort (15.5% vs. 64.5%, respectively), correlating with lower in-hospital mortality (24.3%) [6] . These findings could suggest that a high proportion of patients from our cohort were hospitalized too late, after developing significant hypoxemia and resulting in higher mortality. Since the median time of symptom onset was similar for both groups, one could hypothesize that some of the patients in the diseased group developed hypoxemia faster prior to hospitalization. This implies that we need a better, faster way to recognize hypoxemia in the community setting, which becomes challenging in the context of the ""silent hypoxemia"" that many COVID-19 patients experience early in the course of disease [24] . Additionally, some of our patients experienced further delay in hospitalization, as they previously visited other facilities where they were unable to provide adequate support and oxygen therapy due to lack of resources. The importance of hypoxemia as a predictor of mortality goes beyond COVID-19 and involves other lower respiratory infections as well, as previously studied in children [25] .It comes as no surprise that median SaO 2 levels on admission are significantly lower in our cohort compared with others published [2, 6] . This suggests late presentation, either due to lack of awareness of alarm signs, lack of access to transportation, fear of going to a hospital, and other limitations to timely access to emergency medical care. Consequently, it is essential to encourage patients with suspected COVID-19 to attend the hospital early in the course of disease. In this regard, strategies such as the one implemented in Colombia, where patients receive pulse oximeters to monitor for hypoxemia while ambulatory, represent enticing lowrisk interventions that could help with timely detection of hypoxemia. Pulse oximeters are now relatively inexpensive (between 30 to 40 US dollars in Peru) and can be made widely available in primary care facilities and in the community. This strategy already seems to be helping in the identification of decompensating outpatients with COVID-19 in USA to come to the hospital early for oxygen therapy [26] . For settings where implementation of pulse oximeter use in the community would not be feasible, measuring tachypnea could be an alternative predictive factor on mortality, one that is also simple and inexpensive, as shown in our additional exploratory analysis. Additionally, our findings raise the need for more hospital beds and increased availability of supplemental oxygen as a matter of public health priority; upgrades necessary to meet the expected increase in demand for early care of hypoxemia. These upgrades will need to be complemented with a robust call center and ambulance system in which patients with alarm signs are quickly identified and transferred to the hospital.Hypoxia and inflammation are intertwined at the molecular, cellular, and clinical level [27] . Clinical events that produce acute hypoxemia enhance various cytotoxic functions of neutrophils and can promote hyperinflammation [27] . Animal models found that exposure to low oxygen concentrations results in increased vascular permeability, accumulation of inflammatory cells, and elevated serum cytokine levels [27] . Thus, hypoxia not only represents a consequence of respiratory disease, but also contributes significantly to progressive lung damage after establishment of the initial injury.One of the main complications of COVID-19 is ARDS, developing 8 days after symptom onset [28] . The greater the degree of hypoxemia or the delay in intubation, the greater the mortality in ARDS (27-45%) [29] . The median time from symptom onset in our cohort was 8 days and 98.9% of our deceased patients developed ARDS during hospitalization, which places ARDS as one of the main physiological processes suspected behind our high in-hospital mortality.It is important to note that, according to the level of hypoxemia described, most of our patients would qualify as critical on admission, in which case the mortality is similar to the one described by Wu & Mcgoogan (49%) [30] . In our cohort, 61.3% of patients required ICU care based on high-flow oxygen requirement (FiO 2 � 0.8). Of these, only 10.2% were admitted to the ICU, which is extremely low. Not providing required ICU care in a timely fashion could have directly influenced in-hospital mortality. However, if one considers the possibility of some of our critically ill patients arriving at the hospital with prolonged hypoxemia, one could not rule out that their fatal outcome may have been unchanged even if they had access to ICU care. This would rely on the fact that the higher the hypoxemia, the higher the mortality in ARDS and also that tissue damage due to hypoxia may sometimes reach a ""point of no return"", where patients with respiratory failure are refractory to standard critical care interventions [31] .Augmenting ICU capacity in our setting would have saved more lives. However, we should consider that ICU length of stay is two weeks on average for patients with COVID-19, which means that each ICU bed may be able to accommodate two patients per month. Furthermore, with ICU estimated mortality around 50%, we can assume that, for each ICU bed that we implement, we may save the life of one additional patient per month [16, 32] . In the context of a healthcare system with limited economic and human resources, further strained by the current pandemic, we believe that investing resources towards increasing hospitalization capacity for early general care and oxygen therapy, as well as empowering the primary healthcare system to early detect hypoxemia in the community would probably have a bigger impact on mortality than allocating too many resources on implementing more ICU beds. The fact that we found an inverse relationship between lower SaO 2 on admission and longer hospital length of stay further supports the notion that the strategies discussed would be more cost-effective.The main strength of our study is that our population and setting are representative of care for COVID-19 patients at a public hospital in Lima, the city with the most cases in Peru [10].Our cohort design allows for obtaining adequate information on mortality risk on admission, taking into consideration clinical and demographic factors that may be applicable to any healthcare setting. It is also the first study to evaluate predictive factors of mortality in our country and the first one to associate hypoxemia on admission with inpatient mortality in Latin America. We hope our findings contribute as a framework for designing patient-care strategies for COVID-19 that are adapted to the challenges of low-and middle-income countries.The main limitations of our study are related to the nature of retrospective data collection. Data recorded on medical records was that which was deemed relevant by the treating physician. However, we selected many variables that are considered relevant in the management of patients with COVID-19 and therefore recorded in all cases, allowing us to gather enough data to perform analysis with a high number of observations. Additionally, some records were not available for review by June 11, 2020, as they were being audited, retained prior to archiving, or still in use for patients still admitted to the hospital. The absence of this information could introduce a source of bias, although we estimate that the proportion of records meeting these criteria was small. Due to the method used to determine obesity it is possible that the number of obese patients in our cohort might have been underestimated and thus affected its association with mortality. Unlike other cohorts, the number of RT-PCRs performed among our patients is low, with the majority of cases being confirmed by means of a positive serologic RDT. Nevertheless, these serologic RDT have a specificity of 98.9% and their sensitivity increases to 70% in patients with more than7 days of symptoms, as is the case for the majority of our cohort [33] . Having evaluated patients with typical disease presentation and course in the context of an active pandemic, we consider the positive predictive value to be high.In conclusion, among patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to a public hospital in Peru, in-hospital mortality was high and was independently associated with oxygen saturation below 90% on admission and with age over 60 years. Early identification of hypoxemia and transfer to a healthcare facility with oxygen access should be the goal of outpatient monitoring strategies for suspected cases of COVID-19, so timely access to care helps prevent the deleterious effects of persistent hypoxemia and, in turn, reduce in-hospital mortality.Supporting information S1 File.

The SARS-COV-2 outbreak around the Amazon rainforest: the relevance of the airborne transmission,"important climatic factor in viral spreading, while usual ambient temperatures do not have a strong influence. Another very important result of this analysis was the observation that the onset of collective immunity may have been achieved with a contamination rate of about 15% of the Amazonian population.The ray of light that runs through a dark room reveals the existence of numerous small grains of dust that can float in the air for a long time. Since antiquity, this Currently, this phenomenon has gained tragic relevance due to the uncontrolled dispersion of the Covid-19 throughout the planet, since airborne transmission is one of similar situation occurred with the Influenza virus. While some important books and works drew attention to the relevance of the transmission by aerosols, [3] [4] [5] [6] other authors argued that short-distance transmission by drops would be the main means of infection, 7, 8 and this latter position prevailed for a long time among health authorities who practically ignored airborne transmission. 9,10 At the end of March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a bulletin stating that there was insufficient scientific evidence that SARS-COV-2 was significantly airborne transmitted. A few months ago, at the beginning of the current pandemic, several governments and the most important health authorities on the planet recommended that only hand washing and a distance of two meters between people would be safe protection procedures and that the use of masks was unnecessary throughout the population. However, with the rapid spread of the coronavirus in countries and in the world, the deadly reality has imposed itself and forced the health authorities to reverse this directive, saving thousands of lives by requiring the use of masks in several countries. From a scientific point of view, this late change in positioning was the authorities' recognition that air transmission of SARS-COV-2 is an unquestionable fact. Nevertheless, it remains to be understood how this process takes place.Every global health crisis is a medical, epidemiological, scientific, political, social, and economic event. 11 Only a multidisciplinary approach can fully understand this planetary event. This article is a contribution to this multidisciplinary scientific effort, discussing one of the most important scientific facets of viral transmission. It will be analyzed the SARS-COV-2 outbreak around the Amazon rainforest that may help to understand the relevance of the long-range viral airborne transmission. AmazonianStates have a much higher contamination rate than the Southern and Southeastern States. The study of the Amazon region is particularly interesting because it has very high air humidity that can facilitate the survival of the virus in the external environment.The airborne transmission of the coronavirus is now experimentally well analyzed the air at the Nebraska Hospital Center and also found the SARS-COV-2 in most environments occupied by patients with mild and moderate infections. 13 In these two studies it was not possible to confirm if these viruses were active. However, this doubt was finally resolved by a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the presence of active SARS-COV-2 in droplets was observed more than three hours after they were artificially produced in the laboratory (65% of relative humidity and temperatures between 21-23ºC). 14 Now, it is certain that under normal day-to-day conditions SARS-COV-2 remains active for hours in the droplets suspended in the air. Extensive study published in The Lancet journal, analyzing empirical data from 16 countries on six continents, concluded that the probability of infection by SARS-CoV-2 decreases by 10,6% when using a protection for the eyes. 15 That is, the risk of contagion through the eyes is very high and continues to be minimized by health authorities, including the WHO, as had happened in the case of masks. This may be a new mistake in combating the pandemic.On the other hand, further experiments visualized the production of saliva droplets during a person's normal speech, breathing, sneeze and cough. [16] [17] [18] Thousands of drops were exhaled and their dispersion in the air was video recorded. They used a laser beam technique of high resolution that was able to identify even submicron droplets. In the video from Kyoto University, 19 one can watch the movement of these drops, revealing that while the larger ones fall rapidly and settle on the ground and furniture, there are hundreds of micro droplets that remain suspended in the air several hours after being exhaled. And, most seriously, these small drops disperse rapidly and, a few minutes after their production, occupy the entire environment, covering distances greater than eight meters. was 13% and 15%, respectively. In other cities near the rainforest this percentage attained 20% to 25%. 24 Therefore, the contamination rate that could have produced the interruption of the spread of the epidemic observed in Fig. 1 was only of the order of 15%. If confirmed by further studies, this result could be very useful in combating the pandemic.The striking difference observed between the North and South regions could not be explained by the issue of social isolation measures, since both adopted, almost simultaneously, similar isolation measures. However, a determining factor in viral dissemination is the degree of adherence of the population to the measures adopted. To investigate this factor, it was analyzed daily geo-localized mobile phone data that evaluate social mobility. 25 Figure 2 shows the result of the average social isolation, per week, calculated in the period investigated in this paper. As can be seen in this figure Other possible explanation for a rapid evolution of the epidemic would be a high population concentration. Figure 3 shows the number of inhabitants and population density in the States under investigation. 26 As it can be seen, the States in the Amazon region, Amazonas and Pará, have a smaller population and much lower population density (inhabitants/km 2 ) than the Southern and Southeastern States. Therefore, from this point of view, one would expect contamination to be faster in states with higher population density, contrary to what happened. Fig. 1 . So, the remarkable disparity in the evolution of the contamination in these regions needs to be deeply investigated. Source of primary data: Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE).A factor that can play an important role in the spread of SARS-COV-2 is the climate. During the months investigated in this work, in the regions surrounding the forest, the average temperatures were always above 30ºC and the average relative humidity, above 80%. In southern States, average temperatures and average relative humidity were not higher than 22ºC and 50%, respectively. Therefore, there is no direct relationship between high ambient temperature and decreased transmissibility. On the other hand, some studies showed that, in general, in environments with relative humidity above 60%, approximately, the drops absorb more than evaporate water into the air. 27, 28 So, one can suppose that the airborne transmission of the SARS-COV-2, facilitated by the high humidity of the air, could be a primary factor in the development J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of the epidemic in Brazil. This hypothesis is confirmed by other studies conducted in some cities in Brazil at the beginning of the pandemic, although these studies use the number of cases as an analysis variable. 29, 30 To better understand this relationship, it is interesting to know the amount of water vapor that actually exists in the atmosphere, that is, its absolute humidity. One kilo of air with relative humidity 70%, at 30ºC, contains approximately 19g of water in the form of vapor, while at a relative humidity of 40%, at 22ºC, the amount of water is only 6g. A similar situation has occurred in abattoirs in France, Germany, and the USA that have become huge poles of contamination. The dominant explanation for this phenomenon has been the airborne transmission facilitated by the low temperature of these environments. However, the pandemic evolution in Brazil, Middle East, Europe, China, and USA has demonstrated that habitual temperatures seem to have little influence on the survival of the virus in the external environment. Therefore, as in the Amazonian case, one can suppose that also in the abattoirs the most important factor was the very high humidity of the air needed in these environments. These examples confirm old and classical work that showed the existence of a very complex relationship between coronavirus survival and air temperature and humidity. 32The very high SARS-COV-2 transmission rates in Amazonian States in Brazil and many abattoirs around the world provide empirical corroboration of the relevance of the airborne way of contagion. These two environments have high air humidity that allows viruses to survive much longer in droplets in suspension or deposited on surfaces. Therefore, air humidity seems to be the major climatic factor in the development of the COVID-19 epidemic. On the other hand, apparently, there is no direct relationship between high ambient temperature and decreased transmissibility.Besides, the onset of collective immunity in Amazonian States may have been achieved with a contamination rate of around 15% of the population, much lower than predict J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof",Brazil,abstract,2020-12-08,12

Together, these diseases represent the annual mortality of more than 10 million people worldwide (2). Even with all the progress in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, pathogens still represent a major threat to human health (3) . Every year, the world is somehow affected by a new disease and new infectious agents being inserted into our environment, representing a continuous challenge, especially those caused by viruses, such as the H7N9 influenza virus in 2013 (4), Zika virus outbreak in 2016 (5) , and Chikungunya outbreak in 2019 (6) .Currently, we are experiencing a pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a new type of coronavirus, which was reported earlier this year in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The first case occurred on December 12, 2019, and since then, the numbers of notifications of contagion and deaths attributed to the disease, called COVID-19, have been growing and spreading across the world rapidly (7) . Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan (8) . With the exponential growth of cases, as of February 14, 2020, the WHO declared it a state of a public health emergency and then moved on to a pandemic state. COVID-19 had already spread all over the world, killing more than 700,000 people from different countries. To achieve all these outbreaks, it is mandatory to understand the mechanisms of infection by viral agents, leading to the production of vaccines and antivirals that are increasingly effective and specific to respond to these diseases.Pharmaceutical industry in vitro methods for drug screening, metabolism, and toxicity are based on bidimensional (2D) cell culture of animal lineages. However, 2D cell cultures and cell lineages from animal sources are not able to mimic the tissue microenvironment found in vivo, mainly due to the limitations of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. In this context, three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models emerge as a relevant support tool, as they can provide reproducible results and adaptation of experiments to high throughput performance. Humanized 3D cell culture may fill the gap between 2D cell cultures and animal models, contributing to an understanding of cell and molecular mechanisms closer to human tissue physiology. Tissue engineering is essentially a 3D cell culture approach, and its recent advances have contributed to the development of complex and highly organized 3D cell culture models mimicking tissue microenvironments at the protein and gene levels.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedThe majority of tissue engineering approaches are based on the use of scaffolds as a substitute for extracellular matrices. However, scaffold-free approaches are increasingly being recognized as humanized 3D cell culture models capable of recapitulating cell-cell and cellextracellular matrix interactions mimicking cell differentiation and physiology. The main objective of this review is to understand spheroid and organoid biology, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages, and how these scaffold-free engineered tissues can contribute to a better comprehension of viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 and to in vitro high-throughput models of drug screening.SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, order Nidovirales. They have the largest genome of all RNA viruses, usually ranging from 27 to 32 kb. The single-stranded positive-sense RNA is packaged inside a helical capsid formed by the nucleocapsid protein (N) surrounded by an envelope. Associated with the viral envelope are at least three structural proteins: the membrane protein (M) and the envelope protein (E) that are involved in the assembly of the virus, while the glycoprotein spike (S) is involved in the entry of the virus into cell hostesses. These structural proteins form spikes on the surface of the virus, giving the appearance of having crowns, hence its name. In addition to mediating the entry of the virus, protein S is determinant in reaching the viral host, tissue tropism and an important inducer of the host immune responses (9) . The protein spike (S) is divided into two domains: S1 and S2. The first is responsible for the interaction with the ACE2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), initiating the infection of the host cell by SARS-CoV-2.Since coronavirus was discovered as the causative agent of COVID-19, scientists have been running to better understand the genetic makeup of the virus and to discover how to effectively treat the infection. Until now, no anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug or vaccine has been officially approved due to the absence of adequate evidence, and medical experts can only treat the symptoms of the disease. The individual, when infected, must remain isolated to prevent the disease from spreading for 14 days (8) . One strategy that has been applied is convalescent plasma transfusion, which may be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with severe infection (10) . Many drugs, such as ivermectin (11) , hydroxychloroquine (12), azithromycin (12) , and dexamethasone (13) , are being speculated to treat the infection.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved Drug screening based on in silico analysis has been used to predict the pathogenic mechanisms and some drug targets of SARS-CoV-2. The structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography of the viral proteins is essential for this kind of approach, where drug therapies can be useful affecting the interaction with the host cells or blocking virus replication. After in silico analysis, the potential drugs can be tested using 3D cell culture models analyzing the virus replication and drug candidates to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 infection (14) .Another recent approach to combat SARS-CoV-2 is the therapeutic use of extracellular vesicles derived from adult stem cells, due to their effect on the modulation of anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic pathways. The extracellular vesicles were already tested in acute respiratory distress syndrome and promise a novel treatment for the patients with COVID-19 (15).Furthermore, the efficacy of extracellular vesicles could be tested using 3D cell culture models. The race for rapid detection of the disease has caused many laboratories and companies work on rapid, sensitive, and low-cost tests, in addition to vaccines and treatments. The rapid tests can detect antigen or antibodies. Rapid antigen tests detect the presence of viral proteins and return positive results during infection. Antigen tests provide results in less than 30 minutes, do not need to be processed in a laboratory and are inexpensive to produce, but this speed comes at a cost in sensitivity. If a person has a low amount of virus in their body, the test can give a false negative result (20) . The antibody test detects the body's immune system response to the virus but is not effective in the early stages of infection. Some companies that produce this type of test are: Panbio (™) Abbott test with sensitivity of 93.3% and specificity of 99.4%, this test can detect antigens Accepted Article and antibodies in swab and blood samples; One step covid-2019 test® from Celer with sensitivity of 86.43% and specificity of 99.57%, this test uses only a blood sample and gives the result in 15 minutes, for example.However, to combat COVID-19 in a specific way, a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms of infection is necessary, emerging the importance of the 3D cell culture models developed by the tissue engineering field. Based on these studies, more effective treatment and diagnoses can be produced.To understand human virus infections, different methodologies are used to study the entry of viruses into animal and human cells. For example, scanning electron microscopy was recently used by Caldas and collaborators (21) to identify for the first time the exact moment when SARS-CoV-2 infects a cell and was used in the past to study the morphological structure of SARS-CoV (22) . Other microscopy analyses, such as confocal and epifluorescence analyses, can also be used to track the cytoskeletal movements of viruses during cell infection. This fluorescence technique was already used for HIV, dengue, and hepatitis C virus (23) .In some cases, viral nucleic acids or proteins are abundant and can be easily detected by in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry. Currently, the most common analysis performed to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection and diagnosis (24) is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (25) , which amplifies nucleic acids to detect the virus at a molecular level. In addition, high-throughput proteomic analysis was also performed to identify the set of proteins modulated in Chikungunya infection. Among the 1047 proteins expressed in infective cells, 209 proteins were related to transcription, translation, apoptosis and stress response of the Chikungunya virus (26) . Functional analysis performed by supernatant harvesting as ELISA, multiplex and proteomics might be useful to quantify inflammatory mediators directly related to human virus infections. This approach is particularly interesting for infections caused by SARS-CoV-2, as it has already been shown that the virus is capable of establishing an inflammatory condition known as a ""cytokine storm"" (27) .Proteome analysis has been applied to better understand the changes in the total protein repertoire suffered by the host cell during viral infection. Using two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE), 8 significant changes in host proteins have already been identifiedThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved (MDCK and A549 cells) in H1N1 infection (28) . A proteomic approach was also used to detect virion-associated viral and cellular proteins during HCV infection, and because of that, new host factors, including a nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein that participates in HCV infection, were characterized (29) .The measurement of the release of infectious particles per cell is important because they are related to applications ranging from the manufacture of vaccines to serum neutralization tests for clinical effectiveness. The most commonly accepted methods include endpoint dilution (TCID50) and plate assays (30, 31) . However, depending on the type of virus, the result can take more than two weeks, in addition to requiring intensive work of handling cell culture. The interpretation of the results of these tests is subjective and highly variable, requiring many replicates to obtain a reliable statistical result.In conclusion, different analyses to identify human virus infections in animal and human cells are available, and many of them are helpful for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, the use of high-throughput methods is considered promisor for drug screening tests in in vitro models of virus infection.2D cell culture is commonly used in research laboratories and pharmaceutical industries. It is still considered cost-effective and easy-handled, and most of the analysis protocols are already well established and validated. The overwhelming majority of our knowledge of how viruses cause infection is based upon studies with 2D culture using animal cell lines. However, 2D cell cultures do not resemble the tissue microenvironment found in vivo (Table 1) . Engineered scaffold-free approaches as 3D cell cultures, mostly represented by spheroids and organoids, have gained attention in the last few years due the capacity to closely mimic cell and tissue physiology.In 3D cell cultures, cells are architecturally organized in a compact structure, where a dynamic equilibrium is reached over time in culture of gene expression and protein production, mimicking the performance of tissues in vivo. Besides, the extracellular matrix found in spheroids are produced by their own cells only, once that is no interference of a hydrogel or scaffold or the plastic of culture flasks (40, 35) .This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved Since the 2000s, the number of scientific studies using spheroids and organoids to understand the host cell's response to viral infections has been increasing ( Fig. 1) Spheroids can be formed from differentiated and undifferentiated cells, including adult and multipotent stem cells (35) . Cells are architecturally organized in a compact structure, where a dynamic equilibrium of gene expression and protein production is reached over culture, mimicking the physiology of tissues in vivo (44) . More importantly, the extracellular matrix found in spheroids is produced by their own cells once there is no interference of a hydrogel or scaffold.Cells inside spheroids are responsive to external stimuli, including differentiation events at the molecular level (45, 46) .In the past few years, a high number of studies have been performed using spheroids for tissue engineering approaches. To engineer these 3D models, spheroids were produced from different cell sources, such as human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) and human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), to engineer bone (46-50) and cartilage (44, 50) microtissues. In addition, human chondrocytes were also successfully used to engineer cartilage in vitro (52, 53) . Spheroids were also produced from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), mostly to engineer the liver (54), neural (55) and cardiovascular tissues (56) . However, compared with the number of studies performed with MSCs or ASCs, studies with iPSCs to produce spheroids remain limited. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were also already used to produce spheroids for endothelial tissue engineering approaches, especially in coculture with MSCs (57, 58) . In addition, a high number of studies with cancer lineages were also published to produce reproducible tumor spheroid models for drug screening tests in vitro (59, 60) . Spheroids can be produced by different 3D cell culture techniques (35, 40) . Different studies have already been published showing high-throughput production of spheroids fromThis article is protected by copyright.

Other techniques already described for high-throughput spheroid production consist of using non-adhesive agarose microwell systems (66) , cell culture plates with a higher number of wells, as described by Grinner et al., 2018 (67) , which used a 1536-well plate format to engineer tumour spheroids for drug screening tests. Other studies were already performed using well plates for high-throughput applications, as performed by Liao and collaborators (68) ; however, these authors used a 96-well plate to cast agarose microwells. Alginate hydrogels produced from casted PDMS molds were also used to produce a large number of MSC spheroids with homogeneous size and shape (69) .Another technique consists of using magnetic nanoparticles to assemble spheroids, as performed by Kim and collaborators (70) . The authors used a magnetic pin-array system to concentrate magnetic nanoparticle-incorporated cells and form spheroids. The main advantage is the possibility of assembling 96 spheroids at once with homogeneous size and shape.Prior to 2005, the term organoid was referred to as small tissue fragments taken from organs. Most studies were performed with epithelial tissues, separated from stroma by mechanical and/or enzymatic digestion and cultured in different types of 3D gels to produce organ-like structures in vitro (71) . Currently, an organoid is defined as ""a 3D structure grown from stem cells and consisting of organ-specific cell types that self-organizes through cell sorting and spatially restricted lineage commitment"" (72) . Organoids must be formed from embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and adult stem cells that spatially organize into a restricted lineage functional structure (72) (73) (74) . Organoids must develop functions of that specific organ to be considered organoids, and for that reason, they are commonly used to recapitulate morphogenesis in vitro.During the past few years, different organoid models have been successfully developed in vitro, such as the brain (75, 76), intestine (77) (78) (79) , lungs (80), pancreas (81), stomach (82) and liver (83) . Recent successful models of the intestine (84, 85) derived from adult stem cells and brain derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (86) organoids showed that the constructs were able to mimic morphological and functional properties of both native tissues. To allow organoid formation in vitro, several growth factors are needed to control the self-renewal, self-organization and differentiation of stem cells (74) . The use of Matrigel, a gelatinous protein mixture secreted byThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved mouse sarcoma cells, is required, providing key biomechanical cues to organoid formation (74, 87) . However, their inherent lot-to-lot variability and tumor-derived nature impair the use of organoids as humanized platforms for drug screening (88).Spheroids and organoids have already been explored as a model of viral cycle infection by human viruses (Fig. 1) (23, 41, 42) . A scalable model of spheroids derived from human hepatocytes to study hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and replication was developed by Ananthanarayanan and collaborators (41) . The main results showed that spheroids presented liverspecific functions and a higher level of HCV infection compared with 2D cell culture. Hepatocyte spheroids infected with HCV were produced embedded in Matrigel and showed functional liverlike structures in addition to releasing infectious virions from HCV (89) . The life cycle of bloodborne HCV was also investigated on a 3D non-adherent gel showing high levels of the enzyme thromboxane A2 synthase (TXAS). This enzyme is required for the production of infectious HCV.The result was corroborated in a preclinical assay. Using a TXAS inhibitor (prostaglandin I2 receptor agonist), in an animal model, the levels of HCV infection were reduced (90) . This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved CoV-2 infection. The 3D culture system was responsive to infection, showing fibrose areas. The authors named the strategy lung organoids; however, the culture was not derived from stem cells.All over the world, there is a concern with diseases transmitted by viruses transmitted by arthropods, such as the Dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, but there is still no treatment for this type of infection. Garcez and collaborators (95) investigated the effects of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in human neural stem cells growing as neurospheres and brain organoids. The results showed that the virus was able to infect the cells and, in the organoids, reduced the rate of growth after 11 days in culture. The use of a 3D model was able to show more reliable evidence of ZIKV behavior in vivo, contributing to a better comprehension of microcephaly cases in newborn children during ZIKV epidemics in Brazil.High-throughput systems have the potential to contribute to reducing the number of preclinical studies since they can test a larger set of compounds faster. An efficiently scaffold-free 3D engineered tissue platform for drug screening must show scalability and have well-established end-points. More importantly, the platform must be amenable to the high-throughput system needed for the fast screening of large numbers of drugs. The data generated by high-throughput systems need to be interpreted by adequately designed software, making bioinformatics an essential tool. An important technological bottleneck in the adaptation of these systems is the size and shape of the 3D scaffold-free tissues, since the readout is commonly based on fluorescence emission.Currently, the protocols used for spheroid production are more amenable to highthroughput drug screening compared with organoids (Fig. 2) . Inanov and Grabowska (96) presented a device that allowed the formation and arrangement of 66 spheroids in a unique platform for high-throughput biomarker analysis of spheroids. Recently, Li and collaborators (97) developed a micro-scaffold array showing advantages related to the reduction of cell number, assay time, culture media and drug consumption that can be applied for different cell types, tissue engineering studies and new drug discoveries.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved Cytotoxicity test results showed that the higher drug resistance of the 3D spheroids from cancer cells was independent of cell density. In this line, the spheroid model for high-throughput hepatotoxic studies discussed that drug resistance can be explained by the higher amount of extracellular matrix production, proving its functionality and sensitivity to drug response (98) .Hepatocyte spheroids are sensitive to inducers and inhibitors of liver metabolizing enzymes and are maintained for up to 20 days of culture (99) . An innovative method suitable for highthroughput drug screening was developed by Knowlton This article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedThe number of studies dedicated to high-throughput systems using organoids has increased in the last decade; however, these systems are still low compared with spheroids (Fig. 2) . The majority of studies use organoids derived from tumour biopsies as a model for cancer (106) (107) (108) (109) , and recent studies are investigating the development of organ-on-chip devices with organoids for drug screening (110, 111) . The tumor organoids usually have a diameter of 200 micrometers, making them appropriate for high-throughput systems. The other types of organoids, including the brain and intestine, can reach up to 1 millimeter in diameter, in addition to having various shapes, since they can recapitulate tissue morphogenesis, resulting in tissue microenvironments similar to those in vivo.Dhieruis and collaborators (106) used a biobank of 30 pancreatic tumor organoids from patients. Phan and collaborators (109) developed a high-throughput approach to establish and perform drug screening of tumor organoids. A total of 240 tumor inhibitors were used, and organoids were sensitive to changes in size and morphology. Recently, a method to produce liver organoids by using Matrigel suspension instead of drops was developed by Garnier and collaborators (112) . The use of Matrigel suspension allows automation and high-throughput applications, in addition to showing better stability in the expression of typical liver genes, a usual challenge to be addressed in the development of liver models. This study may represent an important step towards the change of organoid protocols for high-throughput systems. Qian and collaborators also developed a scalable brain organoid platform to model ZIKV exposure (113) .The complexity of organoids also results in a lack of reproducibility and different shapes and sizes, and the same batch impairing image assays are usually used in high-throughput systems for drug screening (114) . As an in vitro viral infection model, the organoid becomes appealing for understanding the impact of infection on cell differentiation and in subpopulations of a given tissue. For example, SARS-CoV-2 seems to infect a transient population of bronchial secretory cells (115).The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other human viruses, such as Zika, dengue and chikungunya, present worldwide could be better understood through the development of reproducible 3D tissue models. The use of human cells in complex 3D scaffold-free culture Accepted Article systems that reproduce tissue microenvironments and cellular interactions is the future for a better understanding of the mechanisms of viral infection, the discovery of therapeutic targets and highthroughput platforms for drug screening. In this context, high-throughput platforms have already been developed using spheroids and some types of organoids, especially tumor organoids.Organoids represent an interesting humanized 3D model for a deeper understanding of human virus infection due to their complexity of cell subpopulations. The use of CRISPR, transduction and other technologies of gene editing can expand the application of these 3D scaffold-free models for drug screening and discovery. In the near future high-throughput platforms using spheroids or organoids should add microphysiological systems (organ-on-a-chips) to reach a more accurate cell physiological response, under dynamic conditions and real-time monitoring.

39d9c79d4e1e50747f0850cc54e1482e83b71eaf,Uncertainty reduction in logistic regressions: a COVID-19 case-study using surrogate locations' asymptotic values,"ulation growth. In epidemics, K is the maximum number of accumulated 26 cases expected for the population under study. It depends on the pathogen 27 transmission mechanism, the social network structure and the underlying 28 contagion dynamics [1] . The key benefit of logistic models is their ability to 29 make predictions with little insight of the underlying specifics of the process, 30 as is often the case in real epidemic surges. 31 In epidemic problems, the characterization of the logistic model around 32 its inflection point enables estimation of its time derivative. Its peak, on the 33 other hand, informs the time of maximum epidemic growth and the corre-34 sponding maximum rate of new cases per day. Logistic models accommodate 35 different choices for the logistic function, and Verhulst's is the most tradi-36 tional one. It has been used to predict the evolution of COVID-19 C(t) 37 in countries, by finding the number of cases C(t critical ) = K/2 at its inflec-38 tion point, which is fed into a machine learning algorithm to predict further 39 evolution of the epidemic curve [13] . The procedure works as long as the in- 40 flection point has been reached in the data. Likewise, the GLF, also known 41 as Richards' growth model, was used to successfully predict the evolution 42 of COVID-19 of various localities, as long as the inflection point has been 43 identified [7, 12] . 44 However, logistic models overfit the data if regression is done before its because one of the reasons for modeling is to estimate both the time and the 51 number of cases at the peak of the epidemic, either for preparedness or for 52 the study of different strategies to deal with the disease.Here, we use independent estimates of the logistic model's upper asymp-54 tote K to constrain the GLF, allowing for stable non-linear regression on data 55 series that end before or around the inflection point. We use surrogate cities 56 from the United States, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Spain where the 57 inflection point of the first COVID-19 wave has been identified, to estimate 58 plausible values for K, that we use to constrain the GLF to predict scenarios 59 in Brazilian cities. We need at least one surrogate city as an anchoring point.The choice of the GLF is for convenience, since it has been shown in the liter-61 ature to work well for . To increase reliability of the 62 data used, we use the accumulated fatalities count curve D(t), and estimate 63 C(t) using the infection fatality rate (IFR). Our predictions use least squares 64 curve-fitting of the constrained GLF on the cumulative fatalities curve data countries for any process that obey logistic growth, such as epidemics. We have used the GLF to model the evolution of fatalities [8, 7] :The uncertainty of ∆Y peak can be approximated by the variance formula, 163 resulting in Equation 4.where the uncertainty σ 2 Y (x) can be obtained by the formula for prediction 165 intervals, using the conventional Delta method for uncertainty propagation.Using surrogate values for K, we performed GLF regression to ian cities' fatalities curves starting from the onset of COVID-19 until June, 195 21/2020. Comparison with the actual observed curve by October/2020, 196 shows that the method gives ranges of expectation for the inflection point up 197 to 100 times narrower than when K is left as a free parameter.Here we will discuss the major results. In surrogate cities, where the (July/2, 14 fatalities/day) [19] , that is compatible with K 12%. NoticeThe GLF regression for the city of São Paulo shows K = 9.2% when K is one of the free parameters ( Figure 3f ). Yet, the uncertainty in the inflection Paulo. The peak number of fatalities found is also compatible with 123 246 deaths/day for the 7-day moving average reported in the official data [19] . 247 We can also observe in Figure 3f worse case scenarios, where K would grow to 248 25%. In such scenario the epidemic peak is predicted to happen a month later 249 but with at least 50% more casualties -this could happen if the population 250 that followed an initial trend relaxes their prophylactic measures.It is important to have in mind the possibility of overloading the using generalized exponentials [20, 21] .Data and code availability statement 320 Code and data are available online.

3d07c729e66d82950cd420a6840b6f2a254e7e6d,Genetic variability in COVID-19-related genes in the Brazilian,"Introduction 1 COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, is currently a 2 worldwide pandemic. To enter human lung cells, SARS-CoV-2 employs the spike protein, 3 which is primed by the host serine protease (TMPRSS2), followed by angiotensin-4 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding, and proteolysis with activation of 5 membrane fusion within endosomes by cathepsin L (CTSL) 1-4 . The main feature in SARS-6CoV-2 infection is pre-activation of the spike protein by FURIN inside the host cell, which 7 leads to increased SARS-CoV-2 spread into lung cells and increased virulence 5 . The rapid 8 SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to an exacerbated immune reaction, and a few studies have 9shown that increased levels of IL-6 (an essential immune response mediator) are associated 10 with increased inflammatory response, respiratory failure, increased probability of 11 intubation, the presence of clinical complications, and higher mortality in patients with 12 COVID-19 [6] [7] [8] . Additional studies found the enrichment of rare variants predicted to be loss-13 of-function in genes related to type I interferon (IFN) immunity to influenza virus among 14 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia (TLR3, TICAM1, TRIF, UNC93B1,  15   TRAF3, TBK1, IRF3, NEMO, IKBKG, IFNAR1, IFNAR2, STAT1, More importantly, there were 70 variants which were exclusive to the Brazilian 1 sample, including 11 variants in genes related to type I INF immunity to influenza virus 9 , 2 six in candidate genes for COVID response identified by GWAS 11 , and five related to 3 SARS-CoV-2 entry in lung cells and virus replication 2, 10 . These are rare or ultra-rare 4 variants, presenting a mean AF of 0.0025 (Supplementary Data 1). Among these, we found 5 one in the dataset from Belo Horizonte and two in the ABraOM database for ACE2 6 p.Arg219Cys; one in the dataset from Barretos and two in the ABraOM database for ACE2 7 p.Leu731Phe; and the TMPRSS2 p.Val160Met variant was present in samples from all the 8 different Brazilian towns and the two public databases (BIPMed and ABraOM), with an 9 AAF ranging from 0.1333 in Belo Horizonte to 0.2931 in Campinas. Among the reported 10 variants in genes influencing type I INF immunity to influenza virus 9 , we found three 11 variants in the ABraOM database (one TLR3 p.Pro554Ser, one IFR3 p.Asn146Lys and one 12 IRF7 p.Pro246Ser) (Supplementary Data1 and 2) . 13In addition, we identified five variants (rs35044562, rs34326463, rs35508621, 14 rs67959919, and rs35624553) which were previously described in the COVID-19 risk core 15 haplotype and inherited from Neanderthals 12 . These were only present in samples from 16 Ribeirão Preto and the BIPMed dataset (rs34326463), Campinas (rs35044562, and 17 rs35508621), and the ABraOM dataset (rs35044562, rs35508621, rs67959919, and 18 rs35624553) (Table 1) . 19 20We identified seven variants that were predicted to affect protein function for the 12 22 algorithms used: p.Phe249Ser, p.Gly164Val, and p.Leu25Pro in the SLC6A20 gene; 23Horizonte; and p.Asn414Ser in the BIPMed dataset). 11We did not find any predicted deleterious variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 based on 12 our 12 algorithm criteria. However, Hou et al. 2 We compared the frequency of these HLA alleles in admixed Brazilians and in populations 1 that occupy the top 10 positions with most cases of COVID-19 and the five populations less 2 affected by the disease, including the United States, India, Russia, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, 3 Spain, Argentina, South Africa, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan. The 4 frequency of these alleles is described in Supplementary Data 3. We noticed that the HLA- The SARS-CoV-2 proteome was presented by a diversity of HLA alleles from 3 classes I and II (Supplementary Table 2 ). The HLA proteins are predicted to bind a small 4 proportion of all possible SARS-CoV-2 derived peptides with high affinity (on average 5 0.5% for HLA class I and 2% for HLA class II). Also, we found a small proportion of weak 6 binders (on average, 1.5% for HLA class I and 8. We studied 27 human COVID-19-related genes and the HLA region in two public 19 genomic databases of admixed Brazilians (BIPMed, www.bipmed.org 19 ; ABraOM 20 http://abraom.ib.usp.br/ 24 ), and additional samples from individuals born in three different 21 towns of south-eastern Brazil. We reported the variants and HLA alleles found in these 22samples and compared them with worldwide populations. We also reported variants 23 constituting the COVID-19 risk core haplotype on locus 3p21.31, described as being 1 inherited from Neanderthals 12 . 2Previous studies showed that the ACE2, TMPRSS2, CTSL, FURIN, and IL6 genes, 3 as well as the HLA region, may be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection 1-5,10 and immune 4 response [6] [7] [8] 14, 23, 25 . Furthermore, variants on loci 3p21.31 and 9q34.2 (encompassing 5 SLC6A20, LZTFL1, FYCO1, CXCR6, XCR1, CCR9, and ABO) have been associated with 6Spanish and Italian patients with COVID-19 11 , and different variants were found to affect 7 the predisposition to life-threatening illness in patients with COVID-19 from different 8 ancestries 9 . 9The analysis of genetic variability in candidate genes for specific populations can 10 help to identify individuals at a higher risk of infection or severe disease by constructing 11 risk haplotypes, which can also provide therapeutic targets for the development of more 12 effective treatments and the control of COVID-19 2,10 . Thus, in addition to investigating 13 genetic variability in the 27 candidate genes, we extended our analysis to include HLA 14 alleles, which influence immunological response to many infectious agents (updated on 15 September 28 th 2020; https://covid19.who.int/; https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). This disease. Thus, it seems likely that different population-specific haplotypes may be 8 associated with an increased risk of severe disease in different populations. 9In conclusion, we found rare variants in three COVID-19-related genes that are 10 present only in the Brazilian dataset and are predicted to affect protein function.

76f8897a790f375e47f6343f9fad5cb0f11a720e,Self-medication practices during the COVID-19 pandemic among the adult population in Peru: A cross-sectional survey,"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a general lock-down in most of the world, leaving the general sense that the only resource that people has is to self-help, self-care and self-medicate (Matias et al., 2020) . The latter gets worsened with the infodemic of fake news that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic (Tasnim et al., 2020; Alvarez-Risco et al., 2020) , and the vast exposure in the news related to any study (in vitro, pre-clinical light into a possible preventive or treatment option (Mallhi et al., 2020) . This has resulted in the self-medication of various prescription drugs that have no confirmed clinical efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 (Mallhi et al., 2020) . Some of them include the antimalaria drug hydroxychloroquine (Hasan et al., 2020) , the antibiotic azithromycin (Molina et al., 2020) , the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen (Sodhi et al., 2020) and the antiretrovirals lopinavir and ritonavir (Lim et al., 2020) . Because of the lack of monitoring, these drugs could cause a shortage of these drugs for patients that need them for approved conditions (Jaffe, 2020) , a direct impact in the price of these drugs (Busari et al., 2020) , and jeopardize peoples' health due to their known adverse events (Mallhi et al., 2020; Rojas et al., 2020) .Peru is among the top 5 countries in the world in reported COVID-19 cases, and second in Latin America, only after Brazil (Dong et al., 2020a) . On September 20, 2020 Peru reported 768,895 COVID-19 cases with a 4.08% lethality rate (MINSA, 2020d) . As Peru becomes a new epicenter of the pandemic in Latin America multiple publications have illustrated its fragmented healthcare system, which has not been the most effective during the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in a high number of physicians' deaths (Gonzales-Tamayo et al., 2020b) and detrimental effects in the mental status of healthcare workers (Yáñez et al., 2020e) . Furthermore, Peru has reported discrepancies in the official reports of COVID-19 deaths nationwide (Yáñez et al., 2020c) , poor execution of SARS-CoV-2 testing and reporting , and an increase number of COVID-19 cases in children and adolescents , Yáñez et al., 2020d . The Ministry of Health in Peru was prompt in publishing COVID-19 symptomatic pharmacological treatment options to try to control de pandemic (MINSA, 2020c) . This included the use in the clinical setting of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin for mild COVID-19 cases; and hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin and/or chloroquine phosphate plus ivermectin for moderate and severe COVID-19 cases (MINSA, 2020c . It comes as no surprise that selfmedication has become common in Peru as panic became generalized among the general public who is anxiously waiting for any positive news regarding the prevention and treatment of this viral infection. This becomes aggravated since Peru occupies the fifth place in the world for COVID-19 confirmed cases (Dong et al., 2020a) , and it currently is the country with the highest mortality rate (MenaFN, 2020) .This self-medication trend has been reported to have increased worldwide based in the number of Google searches since the pandemic started (Onchonga, 2020) . This global trend has caused a tremendous medical challenge (Hughes et al., 2001; Mandal, 2015) because the various prescription drugs currently approved for COVID-19 symptoms carry adverse drug reactions . Furthermore, there is high risk of incorrect dosage, improper route of administration, longer use than intended, improper storage, risk of dependency to abuse, and increased prevalence of pathogenic resistance to drugs , Menary et al., 2011 . Even though, self-medication intention is common worldwide it has only been reported in South Arabia (Mansuri et al., 2020) and Kenya . However, these studies assessed the prevalence of self-medication but did not surveyed what drugs where actually consumed. In this way, we designed this cross-sectional study to investigate the pattern of self-medication among the general public in Peru during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of selfmedicated drugs used for respiratory symptoms, as COVID-19 preventive, for its symptoms or once tested positive. To determine the perception of symptom relief and if there are any demographic variables that promote self-medication in Peru. The results would inform healthcare policy makers on the measures to improve in Peru as they strive to save lives.We conducted an online cross-sectional multicenter survey, which was initially evaluated by experts from different provinces of Peru based on the Delphi method (Varela-Ruiz et al., 2012) . After including the experts' observations, a pilot study was performed (from May 25 to June 3) with 480 respondents in all the 25 provinces of Peru. The pilot data was used to calculate the minimum sample size necessary for the actual study. It was determined that a minimum sample size of 3,138 was necessary to achieve a minimum percentage difference of 2.5% (49.0% versus 51.5%), a statistical power of 80%, and a confidence level of 95% (data not shown). The sample size was calculated using power analysis (Walker et al., 2017) .The actual survey consisted of an online questionnaire in Google surveys that was sent via WhatsApp, Messenger, and Facebook, and it was configured to submit an email at the end of the survey so that investigation group can eliminate duplicate answers. The shared questionnaire was made anonymous ensuring data confidentiality and reliability. This survey was shared in Spanish, as this is the official language in Peru. The survey was performed from June 5 to 17 after approximately 3 months of lockdown and social distancing measures in Peru due to the COVID-19 outbreak. At the beginning of the survey (June 5) the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases was 187,400 and 5,162 deaths (MINSA, 2020a), while at the end of the survey (June 17) the confirmed cases increased to 240,908 and the deaths increased to 7,257 (MINSA, 2020b). We surveyed general public who were adults (over 18 years old) in the 25 Peruvian provinces. Participants were recruited through the COVID-19-GIS-Peru network. Grupo de Investigación en Salud (GIS) stands for Health Research Group, a network of investigators that include physicians, health professionals and students performing COVID-19 social epidemiological studies in Peru and Latinamerica (Mejia et al., 2020a; Mejia et al., 2020b; Mejia et al., 2020c; Mejia et al., 2020d; Mejia et al., 2020e; Araujo-Banchon et al., 2020; Yáñez et al., 2020c) .The survey (Annex 1) included 11 questions, 7 were demographic questions and 4 questions related to self-medication of drugs to prevent and treat respiratory symptoms: drug selection, reasoning for self-medication, symptoms they were looking to improve, and if any of the drugs improved those symptoms. The demographic questions included city where they live, gender, age, marital status, education level, job status, and type of job.The respondents were asked to indicate if during the COVID-19 lockdown they consumed any of the following drugs: acetaminophen, ibuprofen, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, penicillin, antiretrovirals (lopinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir, and others), or any other drug (open question) for respiratory symptoms. The selection of drugs was based on the COVID-19 symptom treatment options approved in Peru at the time (MINSA, 2020c) and based on the drugs reported by the media to be viable treatment options. The respondents were asked to select the reason to use of these drugs from a 7-item list that included: had a cold/flu, no symptoms, COVID-19 prevention, had COVID-19 symptoms, COVID-19 positive, consume the drug regularly, other reason (open question).The respondents were then presented with an 11-item list that included the most common COVID-19 symptoms reported by the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (CDC, 2020) . The respondents were asked to select the symptom(s) why they consumed any of the drug(s) indicated on the previous question. The symptoms included fever, fatigue, cough, muscle ache, nasal congestion, sore throat, headache, breathing difficulty. Sneezing was included since it is a usual cold or flu symptom that often gets confused with a COVID-19 symptom. No symptom and other symptom (open question) was also included. Loss of taste or smell, nausea/ vomiting and diarrhea were not included. Loss of smell (anosmia) was still debated as a COVID-19 symptom at the time of the preparation of the survey. Even though anosmia was reported in some COVID-19 patients as early as April, it is until June 2020 when concrete scientific reports and reviews were published (Meng et al., 2020) .Finally, the respondents were asked to indicate any symptom improvement after drug intake using the 5-item Likert scale with the following options: improved all symptoms, improved most of the symptoms, improved a few of the symptoms, improved only one symptom, did not alleviate any of the symptoms.Data analysis was done in STATA version 14 (Stata Corp) with a significance level set at p < 0.05. The instrument consistency was assessed using the Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20) (Tschannen et al., 2020) for the dichotomous variable of either using (or not) any of the assessed drugs during the lockdown in Peru. The instrument validity was assessed with the knowngroups validity approach by fitting multivariate analysis (Jones et al., 2018) to estimate the preference of self-medication for the surveyed drugs using sex, age, marital status, job status, educational status, and region as control variables. Univariate statistics was performed using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. For analytical statistics, adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained using generalized linear models (GLM), with Poisson family, log-link function, robust models and using region (coast, mountain and jungle) as cluster group.Peru gets divided into three geographic regions because the Andes Mountains, these regions are the Coast (Costa), the Peruvian Andes (Sierra), and the Jungle (Selva) (WHO, 2013) . This geographical division is accompanied with marked differences in access, roads, urbanization, population distribution, health and education services. This results in marked differences in health conditions with the coast, Andes and rainforest having the under-5 mortality rate at 26%, 39% and 42%, respectively (WHO, 2013) . This is in part due to different behaviors toward urgency for medical treatment and the prevalence of pharmacological use. In order to assess differences in our study we used region as a cluster group.The survey was approved by the Universidad Privada Antenor Orrego ethics committee (#0209-2020-UPAO). The participants remained anonymous and had the option to finish the survey at any time, and their information was kept confidential. All the survey participants were well-versed on the study intentions and were required to consent before the enrollment. The participants were not involved in any of the planning, execution and reporting stages of the study.The survey was sent to 6,000 people in the 25 provinces of Peru in order to achieve the minimum sample size of 3,138 calculated based on power analysis. Out of the 6,000 surveys sent online, As shown on Table 2 , the majority of respondents did not selfmedicate (2526 [66.6%]) with any of the surveyed drugs (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, penicillin or azithromycin). Out of the 3792 respondents, it was observed that 1023 respondents reported that they consumed acetaminophen during lockdown, while 281 consumed ibuprofen, 182 azithromycin, 87 penicillin, 60 antiretrovirals and 28 hydroxychloroquine. For all the drugs the main reason for consumption was because the person reported they had a cold or flu. It was observed that a portion of respondents self-medicated because other reasons. For instance, 178 and 75 respondents consumed acetaminophen and ibuprofen, respectively for other reasons, which could be attributed to their broad use as pain relievers and antipyretics. Similarly, for the antibiotics azithromycin and penicillin it was reported that 16 and 28 people, respectively consumed them for other reasons. To a lower extent it was reported that 2 people used the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine for other reasons. We also surveyed if these drugs were consumed regularly, and it was observed that 76 people consumed acetaminophen, 26 ibuprofen, 15 azithromycin, 6 penicillin, 5 antiretrovirals and 3 hydroxychloroquine. Even more concerning, was to observe that people in Peru consumed these drugs without any symptom. For instance, 17 consumed acetaminophen, 7 ibuprofen, 3 azithromycin, 2 hydroxychloroquine, 1 penicillin and another one antiretrovirals. It needs to be acknowledged that the same respondent could have used more than one drug at the same time.On our survey we included three reasons for drug use related to COVID-19: as a preventive, presence of symptoms, and confirmed case. When these three reasons were combined it was observed that the drug with the highest self-medication was acetaminophen with 77 respondents, azithromycin (38), ibuprofen (11), antiretrovirals (8), hydroxychloroquine (7) and penicillin (4). It was observed that as a COVID-19 preventive, 7 respondents selfmedicated with azithromycin, 6 with acetaminophen, 4 with antiretrovirals, 3 with hydroxychloroquine, 2 with penicillin and 1 with ibuprofen. When COVID-19 symptoms were present, the trend changed with acetaminophen been the drug with the highest self-medication (65), followed by azithromycin (23), ibuprofen (9), antiretrovirals (3), hydroxychloroquine (1) and penicillin (1). We also surveyed the self-medication use when diagnosed as COVID-19 positive and it was observed that 8 people used azithromycin, 6 acetaminophen, 3 hydroxychloroquine, and 1 person for ibuprofen, penicillin and antiretrovirals ( Table 2) . Fig. 1 shows the distribution of respiratory symptoms for which the respondents self-medicated with the various drugs we surveyed. The respiratory symptoms we surveyed for were fever, fatigue, cough, sneezing, muscle pain, nasal congestion, sore throat, headache and breathing difficulty. We also surveyed if the respondents self-medicated without any symptom. It was observed that for all the symptoms, except breathing difficulty, the most selfmedicated drug was acetaminophen. In the case of fever, 568 respondents indicated that they consumed at least one of the drugs we surveyed for. For fatigue 145 respondents, 273 for cough, 323 for sneezing, 368 for muscle pain, 291 for nasal congestion, 488 for sore throat, 707 for headache, 60 for breathing difficulty, and 119 without any symptom. In the case of fever, the predominant drugs consumed were acetaminophen ( (Table 2 ). However, this could have been attributed to the combined use of more than one of these drugs or the combination of other drugs that were not assessed in this study. It was observed that a portion of respondents self-medicated because other reasons, which could be attributed to the broad application of the surveyed drugs. For instance, acetaminophen and ibuprofen are widely used as pain relievers and antipyretics. Similarly, azithromycin and penicillin are antibiotics that are consumed for various conditions, and in the case of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine is also used for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis (Jaffe, 2020) .The respondents had the option to indicate any other drug that they used for respiratory symptoms and various drug classes were reported such as antihistamines (cetirizine, chlorphenamine, loratadine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (naproxen, diclofenac), antibiotics (amoxicillin), corticosteroids (dexamethasone), analgesics (metamizole), flu medicine (not specified), vitamin supplements (vitamin C), and others (ginger, garlic, honey, onion, lemon, eucalyptus and sodium bicarbonate). Regarding the total responses for other drugs, the most frequent was cetirizine (13%) followed by chlorphenamine (9%), and naproxen (7%).In the multivariate analysis (Table 3) , it was observed that older respondents had a higher frequency of antiretroviral self- There were no other significant differences in consumption of the other drugs between regions of Peru.Self-medication is more common in countries where healthcare systems tend to be less effective because of long waiting time in healthcare facilities, difficulty in obtaining physicians' appointments, insufficient stock of essential medicines, delay in attention and insufficient amount of available beds/space in healthcare facilities (Meena et al., 2016) . Even before the pandemic Peru already reunited all these characteristics (Alvarez-Risco et al., 2016; Alvarez-Risco et al., 2018) , which became more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic exposing Peru's fragmented and underfunded healthcare system (Gonzales-Tamayo et al., 2020a). Most of the respondents in our study were healthcare workers that during the lockdown have been the first respondents exposed to higher risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 (Ing et al., 2020) . The long hours at work under difficult and stressful circumstances (Bogren et al., 2020) have caused an increase in anxiety, distress and overall psychological burden in healthcare workers in Peru (Yáñez et al., 2020e) . These conditions have been reported to trigger self-medication in order to face work-related stress, pressure, discomfort and anxiety (Omolase et al., 2007; Barros et al., 2009) . The general public is also under stress, anxiety and distress conditions as Peru reports a high number of physician deaths because of COVID-19 (Gonzales-Tamayo et al., 2020a) and has recently became the country with the highest mortality in the world (MenaFN, 2020; Yáñez et al., 2020c) .Our study reported that acetaminophen was the drug most consumed with higher use in the rainforest and lower in the Andes when compared to the coast of Peru. Acetaminophen has also been reported to be a drug that is preferentially self-medicated in Ethiopia (Shafie et al., 2018) and Brazil (Barros et al., 2019) for chronic pain. It has been reported that acetaminophen is widely used by health science major students in Nigeria as a pain reliever (Esan et al., 2018) . However, it is alarming that its consumption is believed to be non-toxic regardless of the dose (Esan et al., 2018) . Acetaminophen standard therapeutic oral dose is 0.5-1 g every 4-6 h to a maximum of 4 g/day, but more importantly it has a dose-dependent toxicity (Roberts et al., 2016) . Acetaminophen can cause hepatoxicity after major overdose (Prescott, 2000) , and severe liver damage has been observed with longterm use even at therapeutic doses in patients with alcoholic liver disease or viral infections (Day et al., 2000) . Furthermore, it has been reported that long-term consumption of acetaminophen carries a potential risk factor for chronic renal failure (McLaughlin et al., 1998) , cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and even mortality (Roberts et al., 2016) . Therefore, acetaminophen is a drug to consume with caution especially considering that its sales has increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic (Romano et al., 2020) . Ibuprofen was the second drug most consumed (7.4%) in our study even though it has been reported that this NSAID increases the risk of developing thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients (Arjomandi Rad et al., 2020) . Furthermore, it has been proposed that it could worsen the course of COVID-19 infection (Yang et al., 2020; Favalli et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2020) , but more evidence is still needed (Torjesen, 2020) . It also needs to considered that ibuprofen alone or in combination with acetaminophen could mask the fever during COVID-19 infection causing a delay in diagnosis and treatment (Favalli et al., 2020; Torjesen, 2020) .Regarding the consumption of the antibiotic azithromycin, one in five respondents who consumed it reported that they consumed it without having any respiratory symptom, as a preventive measure or because they thought they would have COVID-19. In an in vitro study, the combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine showed a synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2, and it was also reported on the possible anti-inflammatory properties of azithromycin, which could improve the disease progression (Damle et al., 2020; Andreani et al., 2020) . However, its administration in combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine has been implicated in the elevation of the QT interval (Mercuro et al., 2020) . Given the limited data available to ensure the efficacy of combination therapy, the American Society for Infectious Diseases recommends that the hydroxychloroquine/ chloroquine plus azithromycin combination be limited to clinical trials (Mercuro et al., 2020; Bhimraj et al., 2020) . Regarding the self-medication of hydroxychloroquine, our study reported that one in four respondents who consumed it said that it was without symptoms, as a preventive measure or because they developed COVID-19 symptoms. The combined use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was publicly endorsed by President Trump, which caused selfmedication causing several reports of severe poisoning in Nigeria and USA (Busari et al., 2020) . This public endorsement triggered various in vitro and in vivo studies that reported a decrease in viral load and mitigation in the cytokine storm in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 (Gautret, Lagier, Parola, Hoang, Meddeb, Mailhe, et al., 2020) . Similarly, various studies reported the positive use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Yao et al., 2020; Gautret et al., 2020a; Gautret et al., 2020b; Million et al., 2020) . However, the consumption of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin caused an increase in cardiotoxic risk such as QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and sudden death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (Mercuro et al., 2020; Chorin et al., 2020; Ramireddy et al., 2020) . Even though, the literature alerts about the possible risks with the combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine it is recommended in Peru for moderate and severe COVID-19 cases in a clinical setting since May 2020 (MINSA, 2020c . For mild COVID-19 patients, hydroxychloroquine is recommended at a dose of 400 mg orally every 12 h for the first day, and 200 mg orally every 12 h for 6 days (MINSA, 2020c) . In the case of moderate to severe COVID-19 patients, hydroxychloroquine is recommended at a dose of 200 mg orally every 8 h for 7 -10 days, or hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin at a dose regimen of 200 mg orally every 8 h for 7-10 days (hydroxychloroquine) + 500 mg orally on the first day and then 250 mg every 24 h for 5 days (MINSA, 2020c). However, on September 7, 2020 the ex-Minister of Health of Peru, Victor Zamora requested for ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to be removed from the official COVID-19 treatment in Peru (RPP, 2020) . It was during his administration that their use was approved, but his recent request was based on the lack of efficacy and increased risk that has been observed over the last few months (RPP, 2020) .Regarding the consumption of antiretrovirals, our study reported that one in six respondents consumed them without symptoms, as a preventive measure or because they thought they had COVID-19. Our multivariate analysis indicated that older people tend to have a higher consumption of antiretrovirals. This could be caused because the perception that any antiretroviral would have a positive effect against the viral COVID-19 infection. However, liver damage has been observed in COVID-19 patients (Velarde-Ruiz Velasco et al., 2020) . Considering that antiretrovirals list liver damage as a common adverse effect (Alonso-Bello et al., 2018; Mallolas et al., 2003) , it would make them inappropriate for use in COVID-19 patients. Their use is relevant for other pathologies, but a recent review has determined that there is no clear evidence of the beneficial effects of antiretrovirals in the prevention of COVID-19 (Ford et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2020b) . More research is still needed to determine the cost and benefit of antiretrovirals for COVID-19.Our study reported that 19 people self-medicated with penicillin without having symptoms, as a preventive measure or because they thought they would have COVID-19. It becomes interesting that penicillin was used because it lacks scientific information that supports its use for COVID-19. However, its use could be partially attributed to a lack of general knowledge about COVID-19 symptoms (Gomez Tejeda et al., 2020) and lack of information on what drugs to take (Huaroto et al., 2020) . More research is needed in order to determine the effect of penicillin in COVID-19 patients.The respondents indicated that they perceived an improvement in respiratory and COVID-19 symptoms after self-medication with these drugs alone or in combination. However, this could have been due to a placebo effect or because the symptoms were mild or because the majority of COVID-19 patients recover due to its lethality rate of less than 5% (MINSA, 2020d). Even though, some of these drugs in Peru do not need prescription (acetaminophen and ibuprofen), the others (azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, penicillin and antiretrovirals) require prescription. Therefore, the pharmaceutical care system needs to be revised in Peru to prevent people to obtaining prescription-drugs so easily or in the black market. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO, 2000) , it is important in a healthcare system to provide personal assessment to patients during pharmaceutical care as an important strategy to provide guidance in the use of Over-thecounter (OTC) and prescription drugs (Tong et al., 2019) .The study had as a limitation that the results cannot be extrapolated to the entire Peruvian population since a random or multilevel sampling has not been carried out for this purpose. Also, cross-sectional studies do not permit an establishment of a clear cause and effect. The objective of this article was to report the frequencies of use and find some statistical associations; however, this report becomes the first study in such a large population in Peru, which could serve as a basis for other research.Self-medication is a significant health issue in Peru, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Various drugs were used for respiratory and COVID-19 related symptoms without sufficient scientific evidence. Acetaminophen was the most consumed drug, but there was also a significant use of antibiotics (penicillin and azithromycin), hydroxychloroquine, and even antiretrovirals. People in Peru consumed them as COVID-19 preventives, to treat suspected symptoms and even after a COVID-19 positive diagnosis. Acetaminophen consumption was associated with the region where one lived, antiretrovirals consumption was associated with the age of the respondent, and penicillin consumption was higher in people currently working. Continuous awareness and sensitization about the risks of self-medication are warranted. Our results should be taken with care and not interpreted as a recommendation to self-medicate nor to use these drugs thinking that they will improve symptomatology. Always seek medical help and consultation before consuming any drug. We hope these results would inform healthcare policy makers on the measures to improve pharmaceutical care as they strive to save lives.The authors declare that no funding was received.

b85a98bc4d80c83153555398b7da4ab58d364f14,Clinical Research Acute Limb Ischemia in a Peruvian Cohort Infected by COVID-19,"COVID-19 is a pathological condition caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. 1 Since the first cases reported in Wuhan (China), the symptoms of the infection have not been specific and are frequently associated with pulmonary complications. 1, 2 Different extrapulmonary manifestations have been described related to acute thromboembolic phenomena in the context of a systemic inflammatory state, endothelial injury, and platelet dysfunction at cardiopulmonary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral venous and arterial level, affecting as high as 49% of patients and overshadowing the prognosis of the disease. 3e5 Recent publications have described a sudden increase in cases of arterial thrombosis in patients with COVID-19, conditioning acute limb ischemia (ALI) and constituting a surgical emergency. 6, 7 Peru is one of the most affected countries in the region by the pandemic, with a cumulative incidence of 23.57 per 1,000 habitants. 8 These arterial complications, which have not been reported so far in Latin America, have been observed in our country, identifying an increase in cases of ALI in patients with COVID- 19 .The objective of this study was to describe the clinical and surgical characteristics in a cohort of patients with ALI infected with COVID-19 in the main Centers of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery in Peru.This was a multicentered, descriptive, observational, and retrospective study. We analyzed 30 patients infected with COVID-19, diagnosed by a molecular test of nasopharyngeal smear or qualitative serological test, associated with ALI. These patients were admitted and evaluated by the vascular and endovascular surgery areas in 6 general hospitals in Lima, Peru: Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen National Hospital, Edgardo Rebagliati Martins National Hospital, Cayetano Heredia National Hospital, Hipolito Unanue National Hospital, Dos de Mayo National Hospital, and Luis N. Saenz National Police Hospital, from March to July 2020. These hospitals had a Vascular Activity Condition (VASCCON) of 2, and the surgeries that treated life-threatening emergencies and limbs of patients were prioritized.The primary source of information were medical records and operative reports of patients treated for ALI and infected with COVID-19 during the period established by the study. The information collected was selected and arranged retrospectively according to the chronological order of their clinical and surgical care. The categorical variables considered were sex, age, body mass index (BMI), pathological history, risk factors, the severity of COVID-19 infection, anatomic location, stage of ischemia, surgery performed, and postoperative events, and the continuous variables considered were the laboratory tests obtained of the patients during hospital admission. The ALI assessment was based on the Rutherford classification system, 9 and the severity of COVID-19 by the proposal of the World Health Organization. 10 Primary amputation was defined as that performed without previous revascularization and secondary amputation as that performed after revascularization within the first 30 days after ALI diagnosis.Surgeries were performed under general or regional anesthesia as required by the patient, using intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) before the arterial clamping. In patients with aortoiliac or femoropopliteal occlusion, an inguinal incision was used to expose the femoral bifurcation, and a brachial exposure was performed on the upper limb. When the tibial arteries were compromised, an infrageniculate approach was performed. Thromboembolectomy was executed using an embolectomy catheter, sized according to the site of occlusion. Patients were anticoagulated during hospitalization with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and UFH and at discharge with LMWH as bridging therapy to warfarin; the latter was left prescribed according to its clinical evolution and control by outpatient clinic. All embolectomy surgeries performed on our patients were technically successful, and their definition was based on the complete removal of the intraluminal clot from the affected vessel with the subsequent presence of adequate runoff and backflow.All statistical calculations were performed as descriptive analysis. Continuous variables were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges. The categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages; likewise, the distribution of the frequencies in absolute values and relative values was made. In all cases, the data analysis was performed using the statistical programs Microsoft Excel 2016 and STATA MP v16 for the Windows 10 version.The study protocol followed standard norms of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen National Hospital Specialized Surgery Department (NIT 1142-2020-0237). The names and addresses of the people included in the study were not used. Because of the retrospective nature of the work, informed consent was not required, and the authors signed a letter of commitment to the confidentiality of the data.Data from 30 patients diagnosed with ALI and SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated. The mean age was 60 ± 15 years (32e99 years), being more frequent in males (76.6%). An average BMI of 28.6 ± 5.9 kg/m 2 was found. The main antecedents were arterial hypertension (33.3%), obesity (33.3%), and diabetes mellitus 2 (26.6%). No patients with myxoma, heart failure, a history of neoplasia, cerebrovascular disease, or vascular surgical history were found. The diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was made through molecular (26.6%) and serological (73.3%) tests. There were 7 patients (23.3%) who came to the hospital only because of ALI. Anticoagulation therapy (LMWH) previous to the ALI was received in 23.3% of the patients. The laboratory tests requested are shown in Table I .The mean ischemic time was 74.7 hr; the leading symptoms were absence of pulse (100%), pain (93.3%), and cyanosis (89.2%) (Fig. 1 ). The majority of patients (93.2%) were classified on Rutherford Stage IIA and IIB (Table II) . The anatomic location of thrombosis was 73.3% on lower limbs and 26.6% on the upper ones, with popliteal (10.7%) and brachial (8.7%) arteries being the most affected ( Fig. 2) .Thrombectomy and fasciotomy were performed in 23 (76.6%) and 6 (20%) patients, respectively, two of them required reoperation 120 hr average after the initial surgical treatment. Postoperative anticoagulation started at 5.7 ± 1.3 hr, and there were no postoperative complications such as bleeding, pseudoaneurysm, or infection of the operative site. Two patients (6.6%) were not operated on because of unfavorable evolution of COVID-19 (Table II) . There were nine amputations (30%), five of them were primary and four were secondary. Rutherford classification patients presented mainly Stage IIA and IIB, 44.4% and 33.3%, respectively. On primary amputations, the mean ischemia time was 206.4 hr, and the surgical indication was the prolonged ischemia time. On secondary amputations, the mean ischemia time was 23.5 hr, and the reason for the surgical indication was poor clinical evolution after initial thrombectomy (Table III) .The hospital stay was 16.6 ± 11.5 days, and 76.6% of the patients were discharged with ambulatory anticoagulant therapy. We reported a mortality of 23.3%, and the main cause was severe COVID-19 infection (85.7%), and a Rutherford IIB staging (71.4%) was associated (Table IV) .The relationship between COVID-19 and arterial thrombosis of limbs is widely described, and it has been frequently reported on male patients especially on older patients, 10 although it has also been described on younger patients without comorbidities. 11 Several studies have sought the risk factors associated with the development of arterial thrombosis related to COVID-19, mainly hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, heart failure, history of heart attack, and smoking, 6,12,13 finding a significant association between older age and coronary disease with ALI ( p < 0.001). 14 In our findings, 18 patients (60%) presented only one or no risk factors, presuming that the mechanism of action of arterial thrombosis would not be directly associated with the aforementioned risk factors. 15 Many of the seriously ill patients infected with COVID-19 and admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) have increased risk of presenting arterial and venous thromboembolic complications. Klok et al. described that in 184 patients with severe COVID-19, the prevalence of arterial thrombosis was 3.7%, and venous thrombosis was 28% 16 ; however, Nicole et al. reported that the primary presentation was an acute thrombotic event, without respiratory symptoms, or mild respiratory discomfort. 15 We have evidenced 14 cases between asymptomatic (23.3%), mild symptoms (10%), and moderate symptoms (13.3%), reinforcing the possibility that other pathophysiological mechanisms explain the prothrombotic state associated with COVID-19, excluding the severe condition of patients on ICU.There is increasing evidence that associates the relationship between a prothrombotic state and COVID-19, as described in different studies that report an increase in D-dimer and fibrinogen values. Likewise, a series of 1,099 patients in China showed that 46% of the patients presented an elevated D- dimer 17, 18 and were associated with poor prognosis and higher mortality. 19 The mean fibrinogen concentrations in COVID-19 patients have been reported to be usually elevated and associated with an acute phase response, 20 as described in our work. The prolongation of the prothrombin time and the decrease in platelets in severe cases show that the coagulation mechanisms are significantly altered compared with uninfected people, allowing these laboratory evaluations to be classified as early predictors of severe forms of the disease. 18, 21, 22 ALI in COVID-19 can occur in two situations. During the in-hospital evolution of severe COVID-19 infection, 6,23e26 Zhan et al. has reported a median of 19 (11e23 days) from the appearance of symptoms of the infection to the installation of ischemia 27 or they can be admitted to the emergency room for this vascular condition with mild or no respiratory symptoms. 28e30 We report an ischemic time of 39 hr, defined from the apparent onset of symptoms to surgical intervention. The factors that determined this time were related to the absence of an early and timely diagnosis, fear of patients going to the hospital, care focused on other more urgent symptoms of COVID-19 infection, availability of beds for management in critical areas, emergency operating rooms, and transfer of the patient to hospital emergency rooms with adequate clinical suspicion. In contrast, Bellosta et al. reported a delay in the transfer of patients with suspected ischemic symptoms of 120 min. 6 The Rutherford staging found in our series was predominantly IIA (75.9%) and IIB (17.2%), a result that differs from that reported by Bellosta et al. (IIB 75% and IIA 10%). 6 This could be related to the magnitude of the inflammatory response and hypercoagulability that patients develop. 31 Likewise, that most of the reported patients were hospitalized (76.6%), where they were clinically evaluated and detected as having ALI by the health team. It should be noted that the diagnosis of ALI in this type of patient was not based on any proposed protocol but mainly on the comprehensive clinical evaluation of the critical patient. Bellosta series found a mortality rate of 40% compared with 24% in our series. 6 Conventional catheter embolectomy was the only revascularization treatment in our series (75.9%), as most reports in both upper and lower limbs. 6, 23, 24, 28 Pharmacological thrombolysis was applied occasionally in some reports, associated with thrombectomy 6, 17 or as the only procedure. 28 Other treatments described were angioplasties with or without a stent or bypass. 6, 26 Recently published studies, mostly from Asia, Europe, and the United States, have usually described venous involvement above the arterial since the beginning of the pandemic. 7,31 Between short and isolated reports, more frequent arterial involvement was shown in the lower limbs, predominantly the popliteal, anterior, and posterior tibial and superficial femoral, iliac, and distal aorta. 7,12,23,24,26,28,32e34 This distribution coincides with our findings where these arteries were mainly counting about 50% of the total of vessels involved.Concerning the upper limbs, frequent involvement of the subclavian, brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries and an isolated case of the brachiocephalic trunk have been reported. 24, 29, 32, 34, 35 In our series, the subclavian artery and the brachial and ulnar arteries constituted more than 25% of the total of vessels affected. On the other hand, infrequent cases of thrombosis affecting aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, aortobifemoral bypass, femoropopliteal bypass and stent, renal artery, mesenteric, and splenic arteries associated with a dark clinical course of the disease have been reported. 6, 7, 12 Our series reported a 30% amputation rate between primary and secondary. These results are higher than those described by Bellosta and Goldman, who reported rates of 6.3% and 25%, respectively. 6, 36 This amputation rate is higher than in patients with acute arterial thrombosis without COVID-19 infection reported in the United States and England. 37, 38 Our high amputation rate could be explained because of elevated number of patients with severe COVID-19 infection (53.3%) and a high number of moderate and severe infected patients among the amputated ones (77.7%). In our series, 60% of patients who developed acute arterial thrombosis during their stay in the ICU required amputation because of poor clinical evolution after thrombectomy; this fact was described by Klok et al., showing a high incidence of arterial thromboembolic complications and amputations in patients who required intensive medicine and mechanical ventilatory support. 16 The decision of primary amputation in our series was based on different factors such as general condition, time of ischemia, or infection of the affected limb, and not on Rutherford's staging, contrary to what was proposed by Hardman et al. 39 Goldman et al. described that coagulation disorders observed in COVID-19 are usually more extensive and severe, finding worse evolution if they are associated with respiratory symptoms and leading to a high frequency of amputations. 36 These findings share a relationship with ours because we found that 78% of the amputations performed in our series were on patients with moderate to severe respiratory compromise. Secondary amputation was performed on 17.4% of patients who underwent thrombectomies, a finding much higher than reported (3e 5%) 39 and one which could be related to the hypercoagulability state in patients infected with COVID-19, 40 thus conditioning adverse results after initial revascularization and higher amputation rates in young patients with acute arterial thrombosis. 41 The mortality rate in our series was 23.3%, similar to other studies with mortality rates between 23 and 40%. 6, 14, 36, 42, 43 The average age of the deceased was 59 years, corresponding to the age group most affected in our population. 44 It is expected that adults aged >80 years are the main affected group, with a higher rate in men in whom hypercoagulable states predominate. 6, 42, 43, 45 Thromboembolic phenomena and mortality correlate with the severity of the infection. 6, 14, 35 In all the patients who died, they had greater clinical severity of COVID-19 infection, and mortality was attributed to acute respiratory distress syndrome. In deceased patients, the anatomic location of thrombosis was mainly infrainguinal (71.4%), similar to what was observed in several case reports. 6, 43 The main limitations of the present work were related to the availability of auxiliary diagnostic studies in the context of the health emergency, such as transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography, angiographic studies and among others, which could help us to identify the etiology of ALI (embolic vs. thrombotic primary) in the context of COVID-19 infection. On the other hand, we believe that the lack of a clear and standardized care  Table III . protocol for the management of these cases was one of the main limitations that weighed on the prognosis and morbidity and mortality of the disease. Finally, the descriptive nature of our study has not allowed us to conclusively conclude or affirm statistically significant premises, which is why there is an urgent need for further analytical studies to help us understand the behavior of this pathology and its respective predictive factors of poor evolution.ALI is a vascular pathology associated with embolic and thrombotic processes. COVID-19 infection can cause severe alterations in coagulation mechanisms, leading some patients to present severe acute arterial complications such as thrombosis, as the only associated manifestation. We report a cohort of 30 patients younger than those described in other studies and with a high frequency of amputations despite adequate surgical treatment. Our series is one of the first reported in Latin America, with a considerable number of patients that allowed us to describe relevant characteristics of arterial thrombosis in patients infected with COVID-19. At the close of this series, we are still admitting a significant number of patients with this condition, who could be added for future research. Table IV . ",Peru,abstract,2020-12-31,12
77bc14ed8b9bcaa5882af2f47fd88053b6853371,Retinal changes in COVID-19 hospitalized cases,"a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111The novel coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) has been responsible for over 16 million confirmed cases worldwide, with more than 800,000 confirmed deaths [1] . The respiratory symptoms that characterize COVID-19 [2, 3] may be associated with a wide range of neurological complications, including cerebrovascular diseases (acute ischemic infarcts in small or large arterial vessels, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and intracranial hemorrhage), usually related to severe or critical disease phenotypes, and which may significantly contribute to patients morbidity and mortality [4] . However, the pathophysiology behind COVID-19 associated brain damage is still poorly understood [5] , and both a direct viral neurotropism or indirect mechanisms involving dysregulated inflammatory cytokines release (""cytokine storm""), vascular endothelial injury and hypercoagulation cascades triggering/ disseminated intravascular coagulation are under investigation [4, 6] .Genomic and structural analyses have reported that one of the major players for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell is the cell surface enzyme protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which acts as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to bind to host cells, followed by cellular transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for priming [7, 8] . In humans, ACE2 is present in the CNS, lungs, kidney, enterocytes, nose, liver, immune system and blood vessels [9, 10] . In the human eye, this protein has been observed in cornea, conjunctiva [11] , aqueous humor [12] and retina [13] . Indeed, evidence of an intraocular renin-angiotensin system regulating important aspects of ocular physiology (e.g. retinal vascular tone and aqueous dynamic) has been demonstrated [12, 14] , and viral ribonucleic acid has been detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in retinal biopsies of deceased COVID-19 patients [15] , which together endorses the rationale for an ophthalmological syndrome of COVID-19, with some pathophysiology still unknown.John Dowling referred to the human retina as ""the approachable part of the brain"" [16] , and it's complex neuronal and vascular milieu can be clinically visualized with proper instruments. Thus, a comprehensive depiction of the ocular fundus from hospitalized SARS-COV-2 patients, with consideration of distinct disease stages and severity, may lead to further insights on the CNS pathology associated with this novel and challenging disease.The present study was designed to evaluate the retinas of confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital units for clinical stabilization and oxygen supplementation, presenting with severe or critical disease, at varying time points after symptoms onset and to measure these changes in reference to interventions and complications.A transversal and observational study was conducted during May 2020 in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and with ethics approval by the Committee of Ethics in Research from Amil Clinical Research board. Patients from two referral centers for COVID-19 treatment in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were recruited and gave written informed consent before fundus examination.Study inclusion criteria included subjects hospitalized for clinical instability caused by COVID-19 who were able to provide informed consent, or with a legal representative able to provide informed consent in the name of the participant. Participants were confirmed cases of COVID-19, which was defined as a positive result on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal swab specimens. Exclusion criteria were patients with negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on nasal swab specimens, and patients with previously diagnosed retinal diseases such as moderate/severe diabetic retinopathy or optic neuropathies.In total, 47 eyes from 25 inpatients from two referral centers for COVID-19 treatment in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were enrolled in the study. Electronic health records were retrospectively analyzed and clinical data collected including age, gender, symptoms and day after symptoms onset for hospitalization, admission serous levels of D-dimer, ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP), day after symptoms onset ophthalmological examination, extension of ground-glass opacities on chest CT and systemic comorbidities.Cases were classified as severe or critical according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Trial Version 7, released by the National Health Commission & National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine on March 3rd, 2020 [17] . Briefly, severe cases included patients with radiological findings of viral pneumonia and clear respiratory distress, characterized by respiratory rate � 30 breaths/minute, or oxygen saturation � 93% at rest; critical cases were those requiring continuous monitoring in intensive care units (ICU) for the eminent risk of hypoxemia and respiratory failure, as well as patients with indications for invasive mechanical ventilation, diagnosis of shock or any other organ failure requiring ICU care.Ocular fundi were evaluated by using a handheld digital retinal camera connected with a smartphone, with nine internal points of gaze fixation for central and peripheral retinal imaging (Phelcom Eyer; Phelcom Technologies, Sao Paulo, Brazil). The procedure was performed in a bedside manner. The examiner (RL) wore proper personal protective equipment including inner and outer gloves, fit-tested N95 mask plus medical mask, gown and goggle [18] . For better retinal documentation, most patients had their pupils pharmacologically dilated by topical instillation of tropicamide 10 mg/mL eye drops.The retinal camera automatically registered both colored and red-free retinographies in each acquisition. Retinal images were sent to a cloud server (EyerCloud; Phelcom Technologies, Sao Paulo, Brazil) and independently analyzed by two researchers (RL and CVFR), who were masked as to the patients' blood parameters and medical history.Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0c software. Data are expressed as mean ± STD. Unpaired two-tailed T-Student test was done to compare the blood parameters mean values of severe and critical disease groups, as well as the mean age and days post symptoms onset for hospital admission and fundus examination. Two-tailed Fisher's exact test was done to compare proportions (gender, symptoms, past medical history and retinal changes). P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Among participants, 64% were men, 36% were women, varying in age between 35 and 75 years (mean ± STD: 51.2 ± 10.8 years). All patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR performed on nasal swab specimens. Regarding disease severity, since all patients required hospitalization for clinical stability, no patients enrolled in the study was classified with mild disease (Table 1) . Also, no patient classified as moderate since oxygen supplementation was necessary to all patients in order to maintain normal oxygen levels. Severe disease was noticed in 13 out of 25 patients (52%) during ophthalmic examination. Finally, 48% patients in our study (12/ 25) presented critical disease requiring ICU monitorization at some moment during their hospital stay (Table 1) . Among them, 67% (8/12) needed mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy, and 33% (4/12) required high-flow oxygen therapy (9-10L/ min) delivered using a Venturi mask.Among symptoms typically found in COVID-19, we observed dyspnea (88%), cough (84%), fever (80%), myalgia (56%), fatigue (32%), headache (24%), nasal congestion (16%), anosmia (8%), ageusia (8%), nausea (4%), odynophagia (4%), hyporexia (4%) and rhinorrhea (4%) ( Table 1 ). In terms of pre-existing medical conditions, 60% had arterial hypertension; 32% and 28% were diabetic or obese, respectively; 24% had no comorbidities; asthma, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypothyroidism were present in 4% patients each (Table 1 ). In this study, COVID-19 patients admitted to the inpatient unit during the acute phase were offered a standard treatment based on intravenous azithromycin, amoxicillin clavulanate and hydroxychloroquine, as well as a single dose of oral ivermectin and daily subcutaneous enoxaparin.A total of four outcome data were evaluated: the one main outcome was retinal changes suggestive of ongoing pathological process; the other three secondary outcomes were comparisons between the two disease severity groups with regard to admission serum level of c-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer and ferritin.The mean ± STD of C-reactive protein (CRP) on hospital admission was 12.51 ± 6.94 mg/dL (reference value: <1.0 mg/dL), while D-dimer and ferritin and were 1.53 ± 0.99 mcg/mL (reference value: <0.5 mcg/mL; missing data: 1/25 participant) and 1495 ± 921.74 ng/mL (reference value: 11-307 ng/mL; missing data: 3/25 participants), respectively. When correlated with disease severity, the admission blood parameters analyzed did not show statistically significant differences when comparing patients with severe or critical disease [(CRP-Severe: 10.85 ± 6.74 mg/dL, N = 11 vs Critical: 14.88 ± 7.06 mg/dL, N = 12; p = 0.18); (D-dimer-Severe: 1.43 ± 0.93 mcg/mL, N = 11 vs Critical: 1.70 ± 1.06 mcg/mL, N = 12; p = 0.53); (Ferritin-Severe: 917.00 ± 654.96 ng/mL, N = 11 vs 1677.43 ± 1276.21 ng/mL, N = 10; p = 0.71)].On chest CT scan, 46% (6/13) of patients with severe disease presented on hospital admission with bilateral ground glass opacities in 25-50% of lung parenchyma, while 15% (2/13) had 50% extension, and 38% (5/13) had >50% of the lung parenchyma affected (missing data: 1/25 participant). Among critical COVID-19 patients, 8% (1/12) presented with 25% of lung parenchyma opacified on admission; 8% (1/12) presented with 25-50% of lung parenchyma with ground glass opacities; 25% (3/12) had 50% ground glass opacities extension in pulmonary chest CT scan; 58% (7/12) had >50% lung compromise; and one patient with critical disease did not have chest CT scan performed on admission to hospital setting. See Table 2 for detailed description of clinical features from each patient enrolled in the study.Patients were admitted to our hospital facility on average after 8.6 ± 3.0 days of symptoms onset, ranging between 2 to 14 days. The fundus examination was performed from 10 to 64 days after beginning of symptoms, with a mean of 23.9 ± 14.2 days (Tables 1 and 2) .Most patients (21/25) permitted the examination of their retina with pharmacological dilation of the pupils using tropicamide 10 mg/mL eye drop. Both eyes were examined in 23 out of 25 patients. Fundus examination was performed with an Eyer portable retinographer (See Materials and methods Section).Patient #6 was a 35 year-old hypertensive and obese man, who presented ground-glass peripheral opacities occupying 25-50% of the organ parenchyma at admission lung CT scan, progressing 15 days later to 50%. His blood parameters on admission were CRP 6.1 mg/dL, Ddimer 0.27 mcg/mL ( Table 2) . Retinal examination was performed on day 59 post symptom onset, showing nerve fiber layer infarcts in both eyes, adjacent to the optic nerve head in the right eye ( Fig 1A) and close to the inferior temporal vasculature in the left (Fig 1B) . Upon 1) , there were no changes in terms of intensity or extension of the lesions previously observed. Additionally, discrete microhemorrhages were noticed in the papillomacular bundle in both eyes. He had a critical phenotype of COVID-19, requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in the ICU due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. During the hospital stay, this patient developed hemodynamic instability, with multiple episodes of systemic hypotension requiring continuous catecholamine infusion at high doses, associated with acute renal injury requiring hemodialysis. Moreover, severe and symptomatic anemia was observed, with hemoglobin levels and hematocrits dipping to values below 6.5 g/dL and 21.0%, respectively. Dysesthesia plus flaccid weakness were evident on distal lower and upper limbs, characterized as sensory and motor axonal polyneuropathy on electroneuromyography test and diagnosed as a neuropathy of critical illness by the medical team ( Table 2 ). When ophthalmological examination was performed, this patient was clinically stabilized with normal kidney function. Patient #18 (Table 2 ) was a 56 year-old man referred in with no comorbidities. He presented with a unilateral flame-shaped lesion approximately one disc diameter from the optic nerve head, adjacent to the inferior temporal vascular arcade (Fig 2) . The contralateral retina had no vascular lesions observed. This patient was admitted 13 days after onset of symptoms (fever, cough, headache, myalgia and dyspnea), had 50% ground-glass opacities bilaterally on pulmonary parenchyma (chest CT scan), and evolved to a severe phenotype but not requiring ICU continuing monitorization or mechanical ventilation. Fundus examination was performed on day 16 after symptoms onset ( Table 2 ). Blood parameters on admission were CRP 12.1 mg/dL, D-dimer 5.92 mcg/mL and ferritin 1030.0 ng/mL ( Table 2 ). Due to particularly high levels of D-dimer during hospitalization, this patient received full anticoagulation with heparin instead of the prophylactic dose routinely used for COVID-19 inpatients.Patient #19 was a 49 year-old hypertensive man hospitalized on the eighth day after symptoms onset (fever, myalgia and dyspnea). He presented with isolated microhemorrhages in both eyes in the inferior retinal quadrant close to the vascular arcades (Fig 3) . Retinal documentation was done on day 12 of symptoms onset. This patient, admitted with altered blood parameters (CRP 6.8 mg/dL; ferritin 1774.0 ng/mL) and abnormal lung CT scan (25-50% ground-glass opacities extension), evolved to a severe COVID-19 phenotype, but not requiring ICU monitorization or mechanical ventilation ( Table 2) .None of the other 22 patients enrolled demonstrated overt retinal changes upon careful analysis of both color and red free retinal photographs.Surprisingly, of the 25 patients with severe or critical disease in our study, only three (12%) manifested convincing retinal changes (microhemorrhages, flame-shaped hemorrhage and nerve fiber layer infarcts). Of their six eyes, five showed retinal lesions. These three patients were in late phases of COVID-19 disease (#6: 59 and 64 days of symptoms onset; #18: 16 days; #19: 12 days). As retinal lesions as described in the present study are not uncommon in septic patients with infectious diseases [19] , our results underline that comorbidities, clinical intercurrences or the robust immune response are more likely related to the retinal findings, instead of a direct neuronal injury from SARS-CoV-2 as previously suggested in mild to moderate COVID-19 outpatients [20] . Patient #6, for instances, was critical and had severe anemia and hypotension, as well as injury to other organs including kidneys and the peripheral nervous system, which could justify the bilateral nerve fiber layer infarcts and microhemorrhages in the papillomacular bundle found upon dilated retinal examination. Patient #18 presented with high serum levels of D-dimer (>5.0 mcg/mL) and required full dosing of subcutaneous enoxaparin for anticoagulation leading to higher bleeding risk; associated with intermittent episodes of cough (Valsalva maneuver), one of the patient's symptoms (Table 2) , this could be related with the isolated unilateral flame-shaped hemorrhage shown upon retinal examination. Patient #19, on the other hand, had systemic hypertension, and although hypertensive retinopathy was not apparent, intermittent blood pressure peaks occurred during his hospital stay and there was a likely fragile blood-retinal barrier due to systemic inflammation, as reflected by elevated inflammatory biomarkers on admission (CRP: 6.8 mg/dL; ferritin: 1774 ng/mL) (Table 2) . Genetic factors may have also influenced the emergence of retinal abnormalities in the three patients depicted in the presented study, in contrast to the other 22 patients who did not present any retinal changes upon careful retinographies evaluation, despite the severe or critical disease phenotype with varied related clinical intercurrences during hospitalization. On the other hand, disease phenotype, per se, does not seem to impact the findings on fundus examination in the present study, as comparison between severe and critical patients showed no statistical significance in terms of retinal changes (Table 1) . Severe pneumonia is the major life-threatening clinical manifestation of COVID-19. This may lead to respiratory distress and lung failure. However, extrapulmonary sites of the disease have been recognized. Various distinct types of neurologic involvements have been reported, such as cerebrovascular diseases, encephalitis, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, meningitis/ encephalitis, olfactory and gustatory disorders independent of nasal mucosa inflammation, demyelinating neuropathy (e.g. Guillain-Barré syndrome), cranial polyneuropathies (e.g. Miller Fischer), radiculopathy and large intracerebral arteria wall inflammation [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Some of these may relate to parainfectious processes, hypoxic injury or dysfunctional immune responses mediated by numerous immunomodulatory molecules like IL-6, IP-10, IFN γ, IL-2, IL-10, G-CSF, MIP1α, and TNF (widespread ""cytokine storm"") [26, 27] . In fact, the inflammatory cytokine storm that marks the later stage of the disease in severe or critically ill patients, together with hypercoagulable state and decreased arterial blood oxygen tension, are closely related to the development of multiorgan damage including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure and cerebrovascular disease [28] , and could also be associated with the retinal findings described in our study [29] .Importantly, the identification of viral RNA in cerebrospinal fluid in case reports [30] along with the presence of SARS-COV-2 spike protein receptor ACE2 in the central nervous system, particularly in vascular endothelium [9] , requires us to consider the hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 directly damaging CNS structures, including the retina. As well, an alternative host cell entry route through the receptor CD147 has been characterized [31] , and a moderate to high expression of CD147 gene has been shown in human retina [32] . Moreover, positive RT-PCR has been reported in human retinal biopsies, suggesting that the viral genome may be directly infecting retinal neurons [15] , and in other vertebrate species, specific coronavirus strains are able to infect retinal neurons both in vitro in retinal cell cultures [33] and in vivo after intravitreal inoculation of viral particles [34] , causing a retinal degeneration named experimental coronavirus retinopathy (ECOR) [35, 36] . This has been shown to be a useful tool to experimentally model human progressive degenerations affecting photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) [34] . In felines, coronavirus (feline infectious peritonitis virus or FIPV) is highly prevalent in the conjunctiva of infected animals, and may be associated with ophthalmological manifestations such as conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, choroiditis with retinal detachment and retinal vasculitis [37] .A recent study specifically investigated neurologic involvement in hospitalized patients, noting that one-quarter of confirmed COVID-19 individuals had some manifestations of CNS affection [38] . Visual impairment was mentioned in 3% of patients, 2% being severe; The presence or absence of retinal changes was not documented.Retinal lesions have been reported in outpatients after confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with mild to moderate symptoms, some of them characterized by non-specific and controversial hyper-reflective optical coherence tomography (OCT) lesions in the ganglion cell and inner plexiform layers, microhemorrhages and nerve fiber infarcts [20, 39] , in addition to another report of two patients showing OCT lesions suggestive of paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) and acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN), although a true association between the retinal pathologies and COVID-19 could not be made [40] . More recently, evaluation of 27 outpatients with retinal fundoscopic, B-scan OCT and OCT angiography at mean of 43 days after COVID-19 symptoms onset showed retinal microangiopathy manifested as cotton wool spots (clinical sign associated with nerve fiber infarcts) in 22% of patients [41] .Laboratorial parameters from blood samples have been shown in COVID-19 patients, such as D-dimer, ferritin and C-reactive protein. These were elevated in most of the patients in our study (Table 2) . Hyperferritinemia is associated with several inflammatory conditions, such as sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). In critically ill patients, hyperferritinemia is associated with the severity of the underlying disease [42] . Elevation of D-dimer underlines an altered coagulation system with cascade dysregulation leading to thrombotic events mostly associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 [6] . Blood CRP and D-dimer have been shown to be significantly higher in severe COVID-19 patients when compared to non-severe cases [38] . In our study, there was no difference between groups (severe vs critical) on admission ferritin, D-dimer or CRP values (Table 2) . Nevertheless, we need to study a larger number of patients to gain sufficient statistical power for such comparisons [38] .A major strength of our study was the bedside retina documentation from confirmed COVID-19 patients still hospitalized for clinical management of severe and critical disease. Upon retina examination, patients were mostly in the inflammatory phase and so more likely to present with systemic hypercoagulopathy, cytokine storm and blood clots formation in small and large arterial vessels and in the venous system, leading to infarcts in several tissues throughout the body, including myocardium, kidneys and lungs. In the CNS, acute cerebrovascular events, both ischemic or hemorrhagic, have been described in COVID-19 patients, some of them reported as subclinical findings or even asymptomatic.As a major limitation of this study, this was a small case series involving 47 eyes from 25 patients. In addition, retinal photography is not sensitive enough to detect small arteriolar or capillary changes in the retinal circulation, nor to demonstrate discrete histological changes in individual retinal layers. OCT, OCT-angiography, fluorescein angiography or electroretinogram (ERG) may reveal subtle lesions. However, these are difficult tests that require much instrumentation and their use in still hospitalized inpatients with droplet precaution is problematic and largely infeasible. Another limitation is a likely underestimation of the number of retinal findings as three patients from this series had the retinographies of only one eye evaluated: #13 and #25 did not consent to undergo pupil dilation, which lead to low image qualities in one of the eyes due small pupil diameter; and #24, who at the time of retinal examination was in the pre-operative period for subarachnoid hemorrhage and had highly anisocoric pupils, so the examiner was advised by the neurosurgery team to not induce pharmacological mydriasis in the miotic eye.To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to show that funduscopically evident retinal vascular lesions such as flame-shaped or microhemorrhages and nerve fiber layer infarcts may be present in not insignificant percentage of severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients during their hospitalization. These retinal changes, only seen after morbid developments, were likely secondary to clinical intercurrences or comorbidities, and may be important and easily accessible outcome measures of therapeutic interventions and sentinels of neurologic and systemic diseases during COVID-19 pandemic.",Brazil,abstract,2020-12-03,12
a25f842dfd41ac8f1a0c9b0380e72ce0de8298d9,COVID-19 in persons affected by Hansen's disease in Brazil,"Hansen's disease remains endemic in Brazil, with 30,000 new cases diagnosed eachyear [1] . Brazil is also one of the countries most severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, reporting 6 million cases and 170,000 deaths to the end of November 2020 [2] . As a first step to investigating occurrence and outcomes of COVID-19 in persons affected by Hansen's disease, we analysed data from six centres in Brazil treating patients with Hansen's disease from 1 st March to 10 th December 2020. Routine multidrug therapy for HD includes clofazimine, which was demonstrated to have SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity in an animal model. This has led to the suggestion that clofazimine might have effects against COVID-19 in humans. We review the history of clofazimine as a treatment for HD and discuss whether it merits investigation as a treatment for COVID-19.Six HD treatment centres were recruited to the study, one each in the municipalities of Belém (state of Pará), Bauru (São Paulo), Brasília (Goias), Vitória (Espírito Santo), Petrolina (Pernambuco), and Palmas (Tocantins). Numbers of patients treated for HD at each centre were collated together with reported diagnoses of COVID-19 and deaths attributed to COVID-19 (from clinic records). Patients attending one centre (Brasília) were routinely tested (by PCR) for COVID-19. Background cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each municipality was obtained from publicly available national surveillance data (https://covid.saude.gov.br/). Ethical approval was obtained from the research ethics committee (Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa, CEP) of the Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (UFES), certificate no. 40347520.5.0000.5060.Of 1,333 patients attending the six clinics between March 1 st and December 10 th , 2020, 70 (5.2%) reported having had COVID-19 ( Table 1) . Most of the patients (97%This is the first population-level report of cases of COVID-19 among persons affected by HD. Whilst the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in patients receiving treatment for HD appears similar to the background cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each municipality, we cannot determine from these preliminary data whether persons affected by Hansen's disease have a higher or lower risk of COVID-19 and associated mortality than the general population. This comparison would require adjustment for differences in age, sex and other factors. The relatively high rate of COVID-19 among HD patients in Brasília reflects routine testing for COVID-19 at this centre, a practice that other centres might consider adopting subject to availability of resources. We will continue to monitor the effects of COVID-19 in persons affected by and treated for HD and we plan to extend this to monitor SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness in this group of patients.Both COVID-19 and reactional states in Hansen's disease can present a severe cytokine storm, with markedly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interferons, tumour necrosis factors, interleukins, and chemokines [3, 4] . In relation to the patient in our preliminary data who had ENL and who died from COVID-19, both conditions share immunological aspects related to generalized neutrophil infiltration: in SARS-CoV-2 infection, extensive neutrophil infiltration in pulmonary capillaries [5] ; in ENL, extensive dermal neutrophil infiltration [6] . COVID-19 neutrophils may trigger ENL or increase its severity, or vice-versa. Systemic corticosteroids are important drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 and Hansen's disease reactions. Prolonged, high-dose treatment with prednisolone (for 12-14 weeks) causing immunosuppression would increase risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection [7] .According to Yuan et al., the dose of clofazimine which demonstrated efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters was 25 mg/kg, corresponding to 200 mg/day in humans [9] .Silva et al. (1972) commented that clofazimine is easily absorbed through the oral route, does not reach high concentrations in the blood because it is quickly captured by the cells of the endothelial reticulum system, and is deposited preferentially in the lungs, liver and skin; it is eliminated in urine, to which it lends a reddish colour, and by the sebaceous glands; dosages in excess of 400 mg/day were not recommended because of gastrointestinal side effects [18]. Clofazimine appears not to accumulate in blood or tissues, therefore in cases of treatment interruption a therapeutic effect is not guaranteed [20] . Conversely, recent pharmacokinetic studies in mouse models point to a possible cumulative effect of clofazimine after 2 weeks to 2 months of regular use and a possible increase in its half-life [21] .For as long as COVID-19 has few prophylactic drugs, and whilst awaiting distribution of vaccines which may take time to reach populations in remote and less well-resourced areas, it has been suggested that clofazimine merits further investigation in relation to possible protective effects against COVID-19. Considering the acute evolution time and high case fatality of COVID-19, side effects from higher doses or prolonged treatment would not be a limitation if clofazimine proved to be effective in suppressing the virus.One clinical trial of oral clofazimine for COVID-19 has been registered, using oral clofazimine 100mg twice daily on day 1, then 100mg daily for 2 days, compared with the same regimen plus a 3-day course of interferon β -1b [NCT04465695]. To investigate the effectiveness of clofazimine against severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we think that a higher dose of clofazimine can be given safely for a longer period. We would propose a clinical trial including oral clofazimine 200 mg/day for around two weeks. The experience of Brazilian physicians in routine use of clofazimine, including in high doses for HD reactions, and the currently high incidence of COVID-19 would make Brazil an ideal setting for such a study. In the meantime, we will continue to monitor the effects of COVID-19 in persons affected by and treated for Hansen's disease, and extend this to monitor SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy in this group of patients.",Brazil,abstract,2020-12-14,12
3ee54159fabb2f23a948c21e3fd4358c89aed1bf,Porcine rotavirus B as primary causative agent of diarrhea outbreaks in newborn piglets,"Rotaviruses (RV) are members of the Reoviridae family and a major cause of acute viral gastroenteritis in young animals, including piglets 1 . RV is a non-enveloped virus and its genome is composed of 11 segments of doublestranded RNA 2 . RV is classified into nine species (A-I), on the basis of the antigenic and genetic characteristics of viral protein 6 (VP6) 3, 4 . A new tentative species J has been recently identified in bats from Serbia 5 . Currently, five of the nine species of RV have been identified in pigs (RVA, RVB, RVC, RVE, and RVH) 6 .RVA was the first RV species to be identified and is considered the most important RV species because of its high prevalence and pathogenicity in both humans and animals 1, 7 . In 2008, a nucleotide sequence-based classification system for the complete genome of RVA strains was developed; this system assigned specific genotypes to each of the 11 RV genome segments according to nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) percent cutoff values 8, 9 . The Rotavirus Classification Working Group (RCWG) maintains this classification and uses the abbreviations Gx-P[x]-Ix-Rx-Cx-Mx-Ax-Nx-Tx-Ex-Hx for the RV genes VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5/6, respectively 8, 10 .Unlike RVA strains, which have been well characterized worldwide, RVB strains remain poorly characterized. In 2012, Marthaler et al. 11 proposed a classification for G genotypes of RVB strains from the United States (USA), establishing 20 G genotypes; however, the complete genome of porcine RVB was described only recently 12 . Shepherd et al. 12 established a provisional genome-based classification for RVB, suggesting and updating nt cutoff values for all RVB gene segments. According to this newly proposed classification, 26G, 5P, 13I, 5R, 5C, 5M, 8A, 10N, 6T, 4E, and 7H genotypes (VP7, VP4, VP6, VP1-VP3, NSP1-NSP5 genes, respectively) of RVB have been described, using nt cutoff values of 80%, 80%, 81%, 78%, 79%, 77%, 76%, 83%, 78%, 76%, and 79%, respectively.Studies conducted in the USA and Brazil have shown high frequencies of RVB in piglets with diarrhoea, mostly in association with other RV species, such as RVA and RVC 6, 7, 11 . Thus, the role of RVB as a primary pathogen remains unclear, and until recently, this species was not considered a major causative agent of diarrhoea in piglets.In the present study, we describe the detection of porcine RVB acting as a potential primary causative agent of neonatal diarrhoea outbreaks in several pig farms from the Central-West region of Brazil and the characterization of G genotypes of these Brazilian RVB field strains.Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Comparative sequence analysis of the VP7 gene of 16 RVB field strains found in this study and the 26 known G genotypes of RVB 12 revealed that at least four different G genotypes (G12, G14, G16, and G20) were circulating in these outbreaks.The GO-949, GO-951, GO-1099, and GO-1113 strains displayed higher (77.1 to 80.4%) nt identity with other G12 strains; the GO-936 strain displayed 80 to 84.4% nt identity with the G14 strains; and the GO-992 strain displayed 81.3 to 85.4% nt identity with the G20 strains. Last, the GO-908, GO-923, GO-968, GO-970, GO-983, GO-1045, GO-1053, GO-1119, GO-1123, and GO-1127 strains showed higher (81.5 to 83.9%) nt identity with the G16 strains, which was the most prevalent G genotype found in this study (Supplementary Table S2 shows the identity matrix of RVB strains described in this study and representative strains of the 26 previously identified RVB G genotypes 12 ).In the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2) , the G16 RVB Brazilian field strains clustered in a different branch in comparison with other G16 strains; however, using the nt cutoff value of 80%, the sequence identity matrix revealed that the strains belong to the same G genotype. Comparison among the Brazilian G12 strains showed that the As the outbreaks occurred over a period of one year, some samples collected from pig herds were from different peaks of diarrhoea episodes, and it was possible to longitudinally analyse these RVB strains. Two different G genotypes were found circulating in pig herds C and D over the sampling period. In pig herd C, the genotype G16 was detected in the first samplings, while in the last sampling, the G12 genotype was identified. Alternatively, in pig herd D, the genotype G14 was identified in the first samplings, while the genotype G16 was detected in the last samplings (Table 1 ).Although RVA has been reported as the most prevalent RV species in both humans and animals, porcine RVB was previously described in several regions worldwide, but usually in sporadic cases [13] [14] [15] . Studies conducted in Japan, the USA, and Brazil have shown porcine RVB frequencies of 25.9%, 46.8%, and 32%, respectively 6, 11, 16 . However, in these previous reports, RVB was detected mostly in association with other RV species, such as RVA, RVC, and RVH. In the present study, we detected porcine RVB in more than 70% (64/90) of the diarrheic faeces/ intestine tissues, with the highest RVB frequency reported thus far. In addition, most (58/90; 64.4%) of the diarrheic faecal samples were positive only for RVB, and coinfections with other RV species were detected in only 6 (6.7%) faecal samples. Furthermore, other important enteric viruses (RVC, SDCoV, PEDV, TGEV, SVV, and PEV) were not detected in these samples, and diarrhoea outbreaks were unresponsive to treatment with wide-spectrum antibiotics.The high mortality rate observed in the outbreaks reported in this study suggests the involvement of pathogenic RVB field strains. The marked villous atrophy observed in the small intestines of affected piglets resulted in acute malabsorption and diarrhoea, which may have led to the high mortality of piglets. Infections caused by SVV and TGEV may produce similar lesions in the intestines of affected pigs [17] [18] [19] . Nevertheless, in this study, these viral disease pathogens were not identified by RT-PCR. It must be highlighted that RV replicates predominantly in the cytoplasm of villous enterocytes of the jejunum and ileum and induces cell lysis, villous blunting and atrophy, as observed by histopathology. Severe lesions are mostly associated with the RVA and RVC species 20,21 ; however, our results suggest that RVB may also induce marked lesions in the small intestine of affected piglets and can be considered an important enteric pathogen in pigs, acting as a primary aetiologic agent of neonatal diarrhoea outbreaks.Kuga et al. 16 and Marthaler et al. 11 observed the highest frequencies of RVB in animals > 55 days of age or fattening pigs, implying that RVB detection in clinical samples appears to increase with age. On the other hand, Alekseev et al. 22 detected RVB causing a diarrhoea outbreak in suckling piglets with 3 to 5 days of age in Russia, www.nature.com/scientificreports/ corroborating our results. The diarrhoea outbreaks described in our study affected only piglets < 20 days of age, mostly newborn piglets, suggesting that RVB can be highly detected in all age groups. Some authors have suggested that the immune pressure induced by mass vaccination against RVA may have driven the selection and emergence of other RV species, such as RVB and RVC 23, 24 . The high frequency of RVB found in this study contributes to this hypothesis since the sows of all pig herds described in this study were routinely vaccinated against enteric pathogens, including RVA. Molinari et al. 6 reported similar findings describing It is known that RVA species are shed in large quantities in stools of infected animals during episodes of diarrhoea, with viral loads of approximately 10 12 viral particles per gram of faeces 25 . In this study, the RVB viral load found was up to 8.5 × 10 8 genomic copies/g of faeces, suggesting that lower quantities of RVB are shed during the acute period of infection compared to RVA. However, few virions are needed to cause disease in susceptible animals 4 and the transmission of RV infection occurs predominantly by the faecal-oral route, suggesting that environmental contamination contributed to the various outbreaks that occurred during the total outbreak period described in the present study.The low prevalence of RVB reported worldwide may not be a consequence of a low infection rate but rather due to diagnostic gaps 26 . Some techniques, such as ssPAGE and EM, have low sensitivity, presenting an LOD of approximately 10 6 particles/mL 27 . In this study, the prevalence of RVB found by conventional RT-PCR was higher than by ssPAGE. Moreover, the viral loads found in this study varied from 7.6 × 10 2 to 8.5 × 10 8 genomic copies/g of faeces, and most of the positive samples on ssPAGE presented viral loads above 10 6 genomic copies/g of faeces (data not shown). Therefore, the use of more sensitive diagnostic techniques is necessary to avoid false-negative results. Molecular techniques, such as RT-PCR and qRT-PCR, usually present high sensitivity and are suitable assays to detect RVB from porcine biological samples 6, 7, 23 .Unlike RVA, RVB does not adapt and propagate in cell culture, which has hindered its serological and molecular characterization, as well as the development of vaccines against RVB disease. In 1996, the isolation of a putative RVB strain in cultured cells, designated the SKA-1 strain, was reported 28 . However, some years later, the same research group found that this strain was actually more closely related to RVH 29 . In this study, our attempts to isolate RVB in cell culture were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, by EM, we identified RV-like particles in the same sample that was submitted for virus isolation in cell culture. Electron microscopy lacks specificity because it cannot differentiate among RV species 2 ; however, the submitted sample tested negative in the RT-PCR for all RV species and other viral agents, except for RVB, suggesting that the virus identified was probably RVB. In addition, the VP7 protein of this RVB strain was amplified, and we could determine its G genotype (G20).Until recently, information regarding the genome of porcine RVB strains was restricted to only a few proteins 11, 16, [30] [31] [32] [33] . The classification for G genotypes was first proposed by Kuga et al. 16 , who analysed the VP7 gene of Japanese RVB strains. Using nt cutoff values of 67 and 76%, the authors established five G genotypes, divided into 12 clusters 16 . After that, based on the analysis of RVB strains from the USA, Marthaler et al. 11 proposed a modification of the nt cutoff value to 80%, establishing twenty G genotypes. Based on this new cutoff value, Lahon et al. 14 and Molinari et al. 34 each described new RVB G genotypes, G21 and G22, respectively. More recently, Shepherd et al. 12 described the whole genome of USA RVB strains, suggesting and updating cutoff values for all RVB gene segments, including those that had not been established yet. According to this most recent classification, 26 G genotypes for RVB were defined. In addition, the previously reported Brazilian G22 strain 34 was reclassified into the G24 genotype.Only two VP7 RVB strains have been described in Brazil thus far, BR31 (G14) and BR62 (G24) 6, 34 . In this study, we report 16 new Brazilian VP7 RVB wild-type strains. The phylogenetic analysis performed with the complete VP7 gene of the RVB strains identified in this study revealed that four different G genotypes were circulating in the same Brazilian geographic region (Central-West). The G16 genotype was the most prevalent, followed by the G12, G20, and G14 genotypes. Marthaler et al. 11 also reported G16 as the most prevalent G genotype in RVB field strains in the USA.Interestingly, in the two pig herds from which we performed longitudinal phylogenetic analysis, two different G genotypes were detected over the sampling period. In pig herd C, the G16 genotype was detected within the first to third samplings, while in the fourth sampling, which occurred 8 months later, the G12 genotype was found. Similarly, in pig herd D, the genotype found in the first sampling was G14, and the G16 genotype was found circulating in the same herd ten months later. These findings suggest a high variation in G genotypes circulating in Brazil.RVB appears to be more diverse than RVA and RVC when considering the number of genotypes in swine hosts. According to Shepherd et al. 12 , 17 G genotypes of RVB have been identified in pigs compared with 12 and 15 G genotypes of RVA and RVC, respectively. Some authors even suggested that swine species might be the original natural host of RVB, strongly contributing to the genetic diversity of this RV species 16, 35 .Since RVB has been identified as an important enteric pathogen of pigs, it is essential to incorporate screening for RVB along with RVA and RVC in the diagnostic routine of swine enteric diseases. More information about the epidemiology of porcine RVB is needed to better understand its pathogenicity and prevent RVB infections, since to date there are no vaccines available for this RV species.This study reports RVB as the primary causative agent of neonatal diarrhoea outbreaks in newborn piglets. RVB was associated with marked villous atrophy and blunting in the jejunum of affected piglets, inducing malabsorptive diarrhoea and leading to high mortality rates. We suggest that the reported repeated outbreaks in these pig herds were associated with environmental contamination since we found mild to high genomic copies of RVB in piglet faeces. Additionally, the rates of RVB diagnosis in diarrhoea outbreaks reported in this study were much higher than those described in previous studies, mainly in single infections. Moreover, the variety of G genotypes identified in these outbreaks suggests that genetic diversity among porcine RVB field strains may be underestimated. Further studies are necessary to investigate the prevalence of RVB in other regions of Brazil and in other countries, as well as to identify the genotypes circulating worldwide. Herds and samples. Neonatal diarrhoea outbreaks occurred from July 2017 to August 2018 in piglet production units from eight pig herds located in a single state of the Central-West region of Brazil. The all-in-all-out production system was used for all the pig herds, and good nutritional and health management practices were used, including the addition of vitamin and probiotic supplements and heat placement for newborn piglets. All sows were vaccinated with a commercial vaccine containing the RVA OSU (G5P [7] ) strain, Escherichia coli (K88, K99, F41 and 987P) and Clostridium perfringens types C and D, following the manufacturer's recommendations. Nevertheless, the outbreaks were unresponsive to wide-spectrum antibiotic therapy, exhibiting high mortality (10 to 50%) and morbidity (35 to 50%) rates. Piglets up to 20 days of age, mostly newborn piglets, from all herds were affected and exhibited dehydration and watery diarrhoea, with the onset of symptoms usually at one day after birth. For four of the eight pig herds affected by the diarrhoea outbreak, four or five sampling were collected at different times, with 1-8 months between each sampling, enabling us to perform a longitudinal analysis of these herds.A total of 90 biological samples, including 77 diarrheic faeces and 13 fragments of the small intestines from suckling piglets (1 to 20 days of age), were subjected to analysis for the identification of enteric viruses. All intestinal fragments were immersed in 10% buffered formalin solution and then routinely processed for histopathologic evaluation with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.Nucleic acid extraction, PAGE, and conventional RT-PCR. The nucleic acid was extracted from 10% faecal/intestine suspensions in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, using a combination of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and silica/guanidine isothiocyanate methods, described by Alfieri et al. 36 . The nucleic acid was eluted in 50 µL of UltraPure DEPC-treated water (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and stored at − 80 °C until further use. Aliquots of ultrapure sterile water were included in all nucleic acid extraction and the following procedures as negative controls.All the samples were tested by PAGE assay to verify the presence of RV 13 . The extracted nucleic acid was also subjected to conventional RT-PCR assay to investigate and confirm the presence of RV species A, B, C, and H, as well as other porcine enteric viruses, such as SDCoV, PEDV, TGEV, SVV, and PEV. The gene targets and the RT-PCR products of each virus are described in Table 2 . The amplified products were analysed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis in TBE buffer; the gels were stained with 0.5 µg/mL of ethidium bromide and visualized under ultraviolet light.Transmission electron microscopy. Two faecal samples positive for RVB in the RT-PCR assay were subjected to EM examination. The 10% (w/v) faecal suspensions in PBS solution were clarified by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 30 min. Then, a 5 µL drop of each sample was applied onto a 300-mesh formvar-coated cooper grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and negatively stained with 3% phosphotungstic acid for 90 s. Grids were prepared in duplicate and examined at 80 kV with a Tecnai-G2 transmission electron microscope (FEI Company, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Table 2 .

A 10% (w/v) faecal suspension in PBS solution was pretreated with 3 × penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone (Gibco Antibiotic-Antimycotic, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 24 h. Then, the suspension was supplemented with 10 µg/mL trypsin and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Before inoculation, the confluent monolayer cells were washed 2-3 times with serum-free DMEM. Then, 1 mL of the treated suspension was inoculated onto the cell monolayer. The inoculum was allowed to adsorb at 37 °C for 3 h in a temperature-controlled rocker platform. The inoculated MA-104 cells were maintained with serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.5 µg/mL trypsin in a CO 2 incubator (Thermo Electron Corporation, Marietta, OH, USA) and inspected daily for CPE.qRT-PCR assay. All RVB-positive samples in the RT-PCR assay from these outbreaks were subjected to qRT-PCR assay to quantify the corresponding viral load. The qRT-PCR assay was developed in this study to quantify RVB RNA in biological samples.The primers qRVB1174-Fw (5′-TGT TAG TAT CCG CAT TTG CTG-3′) and qRVB1269-Rv (5′-GGG TTT TAT TGC TTA TTT TTTCG-3′) were designed to amplify a 95 bp fragment of a specific region of the porcine RVB VP6 gene. The probe was defined as qRVB1206-pb (5′-FAM-TCC GGC GTC AGC TCC CAA AGG-MGB-3′) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).The qRT-PCR assay was performed in a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The qRT-PCR master mix was prepared following the manufacturer's instructions with a final volume of 25 µL, including 50 nM Rox Reference Dye, 400 nM each forward and reverse primer, 200 nM probe and 5 µL of genomic template. All the samples were tested in triplicate. The cycling conditions included reverse transcription for 15 min at 50 °C, Taq activation for 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, and 30 s at 60 °C. Sterile ultrapure water was used as a negative control in all reactions.The number of genome copies present in the RVB-positive samples was estimated by comparing the sample cycle threshold (C t ) value to standard curves. To generate the standard curves, a 95 bp-RVB VP6 fragment was cloned into the pCR 4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and ligation products were transformed into TOP10 competent E. coli. After transformation, E. coli insert-containing cultures were extracted and purified by PureLink Quick Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and then quantified by Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Eugene, OR, USA). Tenfold serial dilutions of the RVB VP6 clone containing 1.34 × 10 7 to 1.34 × 10 0 copies/µL were used to generate the standard curve and to estimate the LOD of the qRT-PCR assay. The final concentration in the samples was adjusted based on the volume of nucleic acids used and was expressed per gram of faeces/intestine tissue.Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. To identify the G genotypes of the porcine RVB strains, a VP7specific RT-PCR was carried out as described by Kuga et al. 16 . Sixteen RVB-positive faecal samples were selected for sequence analysis, and at least one RVB field strain was chosen from each pig herd. The RT-PCR products of approximately 800 bp were purified using the PureLink Quick Gel Extraction and PCR Purification Combo Kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), quantified with a Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Eugene, OR, USA), and sequenced using an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyser with a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).Sequence quality analyses and consensus were conducted using Phred and CAP3 software (https ://aspar gin.cenar gen.embra pa.br/phph/). Sequence similarity searches were performed with sequences deposited in GenBank using the Nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTn) (https ://blast .ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ Blast .cgi). A phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequences of the VP7 gene of porcine RVB strains described in this study and representative strains of the 26 previously identified RVB G genotypes 12 was created using the neighbour-joining method based on the Kimura two-parameter model, which provided statistical support by bootstrapping with 1,000 replicates in MEGA 7 software 37 . BioEdit software, version 7.2.5, was used to construct the sequence identity matrix 38 . The nt cutoff value used to classify the RVB strains into G genotypes was 80%, as suggested by Shepherd et al. 12 (accession numbers of all RVB G genotype strains used to construct the phylogenetic tree and the identity matrix can be found as Supplementary Table S3 online).Nucleotide sequences accession numbers. The nucleotide sequences described in this study were deposited in the GenBank database under the following accession numbers: MN540126 to MN540141. Ethical approval. This study was submitted to the Ethics Committee on Animal Experiments of the Universidade Estadual de Londrina and approved under the identification number 11363.2015.16. All applicable international, national, and/or institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed.",Brazil,abstract,2020-12-15,12
1a5d75b556b3bbc76dcf3578fecaf95a59da3a70,Economic stimulus for COVID-19 pandemic and its determinants: evidence from cross-country analysis,"On 9 th December of 2019 the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, pandemic emerged in Wuhan, China and has spread to 214 countries and territories causing 35,092,046 cases and 1,036,914 deaths as of October 04,2020 1 . Along with these huge human misery and loss of lives, this pandemic produced a major economic depression worldwide. The world's prevalent economies (U.S., European countries and China) are amid the ones that have been most affected by the outbreak.The COVID-19 pandemic has direct damaging impacts on the economy in numerous ways. For example, there are border closers, stay at home requirements, lockdowns which directly affect peoples' socioeconomic life. Also, disease-ridden employees who are quarantined or hospitalized cannot join the workforce, which has numerous demand and supply-side consequences. In addition, the psychological consequence of the pandemic results in extraction from economic doings by agents who chooses to espouse 'wait and see' attitude. Furthermore, measures already undertaken and still undertaking, such as lockdown, factory closures, social distancing, for flattening the contagion curve certainly steepens the macroeconomic downturn curve. These measures have been found effective in reducing the contagion rate as for example in Singapore Hong Kong and China (Anderson et al., 2020; Prem et al., 2020 ). Yet, these non-pharmaceutical actions hinder economic goings-on by restraining human mobility and business processes (Eichenbaum et al., 2020) . Specially, the COVID-19 pandemic and allied public health measures have interrupted supply chains and contracted doings in manufacturing and service sectors, which consecutively steered to augmented layoffs. World experienced stock markets crash and the unemployment rate rose to a much higher level . Zaremba, Kizys, Aharon and Demir (2020) investigated whether government interventions aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19 affect stock market volatility. Applying data of 67 countries, authors observed that the government interventions are associated with higher stock market volatility. Authors concluded that an increase in the stringency of a government response by one index point triggers an increase in daily stock market volatility. Mentioning that no preceding infectious disease outbreak, including the Spanish Flu, has affected the stock market as forcefully as the COVID-19 pandemic, Baker et al. (2020) focused on the causes that drove the tremendous recent surge in stock market volatility. Employing U.S. stock market data and COVID-19 relating data, authors found that government restrictions on commercial activity and voluntary social distancing, operating with powerful effects in a service-oriented economy, are the main reasons the U.S. stock market reacted heavily to COVID-19. In a similar study, Albuquerque et al. (2020) contended that COVID-19 pandemic shows an unparalleled tremor to the stock market. According to authors, this is because of firstly, the COVID-19 crisis and the succeeding economic lockdown is an unanticipated shock to global stock markets. Secondly, it is an exogenous shock that coined out of public health concerns, not for economic circumstances and thirdly, the pandemic resulted in a stock market crash.Thus, it is inevitable to mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 pandemic on economy. Countries poured down trillions of dollars in stimulus packages to save their economy and livelihood. Covid-19 economic stimulus packages refers to the key economic responses governments are taking across the world to limit the human and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments across the world have undertaken several stimulus packages including fiscal, and monetary measures targeting households, health care, and manufacturing and servicing industries (Bayer et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2020; Gourinchas, 2020) and there is variation between the responses provided by different national governments to the COVID-19 pandemic (Capano et al., 2020) . In response to COVID-19 pandemic, monetary policy responses undertaken by countries includes to liquidity support to banks. Archetypal fiscal policies contain allocations to households and businesses entities, costs of temporary layoffs, increase of social safety assistances, and resources for the countries' healthcare system. For instance, South Korea announced cash transfers for isolated persons, consumption tokens for low-income families, and income and rental support for small and medium-sized businesses. Germany enlarged entrance to temporary work subsidy, improved childcare welfares for low-income parentages, and delivered grants to small and medium business proprietors who were affected by the pandemic. United Kingdom, the 2 nd highest death facing countries, upto 6 May, total death of U.K is 30,076 2 , delivered much funding for their National Health Service, took measures to assist businesses operations, direct donations for small business, and reimbursement for sick pay leave, and fortified the social safety net to assist helpless individuals (International Monetary Fund, 2020) .In this research, we review diverse economic policy measures undertaken by policymakers and governments of countries as a response to COVID-19 pandemic which consists of mostly fiscal, monetary and exchange rate measures. We argue that no single stimulus would be able to dampen the destructive effects of a pandemic and a collective measures are needed. Thus, using the Euclidean distance (EI) method, we develop an Index of COVID-19 Economic Stimulus (ICES) which pooled all undertaken fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate measures. This index systematizes the economic policy responses undertaken by governments across the world, thus permits to study cross-country differences in strategies and policies. In addition, we explore to what level countries' economic responses are formed by numerous country features, pandemic-related variables and public health measures (Correia et al., 2020) . The contributions of the study is manifold. First, we develop a new composite index to measure economic policy responses to COVID-19 pandemic. Second, this study would contribute to its field by adding literatures of the measurement issues of stimulus index. Third, this robust and composite index can be applied by policy makers to see their state of affairs allied to COVID-19 pandemic; can be helpful for policy making process and to keep an eye on the improvement of the policy programs undertaken to combat economic downturn.Countries across the world have adopted a number of economic policies in response to COVID-19 pandemic (Hale, Petherick, Phillips and Webster, 2020) . For example, transfer of cash to households, subsidies to business and so on. We argue that no single measure is enough to reduce the effect of a pandemic. A single indicator might provide useful information on a single aspect of any issue but might produce contradictory results when combining them together (Sarma, 2015) . To avoid such contradictory results, Sarma (2015) proposed a comprehensive index of financial inclusion that encompasses different indicators of financial development. Arguing similar with Sarma (2015) , an index of economic stimulus packages is needed, first of all, to avoid contradictory results. For example, as a response to COVID-19 pandemic, a country might provide more stimuli to health sector while overlooked or has less emphasis on other economic sectors including business and poor households. Result from such policy might be contradictory. As such we focus on developing a composite Index of COVID-19 economic stimulus which will enable respective country's government to monitor their policy effectiveness as a whole. The foremost advantage of such composite index is that it yields a single value for every nation or area and thus one can spot the standing of a specific country or region of interest and then compare it with any other countries or regions straightforwardly while data on several indicators might become a big issue.With an attempt to fill these gaps, the objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive index of COVID-19 Economic Stimulus and thereby measures the extent of economic responses taken by governments. Also, this research intended to empirically identify and analyze the determinants of economic stimulus undertaken in response to COVID-19 pandemic.To construct the current comprehensive stimulus index, we employed similar methods applied by United Nation Development Programme to develop such indices as Human Development Index (HDI) 3 . At the first step, value of dimension index for the i th dimension d i is computed as under:In Eq. (1), d i is value of i th dimension index; A i is real value of i th dimension; m i is minimum value of i th dimension, and M i is maximum value of i th dimension. Eq. (1) ensures 0 d i 1. Accordingly, in Eq. (1), the higher the value of d i , the higher the country's policy response in dimension i. For n dimensions of policy response, a particular country i will be denoted by a point D i ¼ (d 1 , d 2 , d 3 …d n ) on n-dimensional Cartesian space. In the n-dimensional space, the point O ¼ (0,0,0,…0) stand for the point representing the worst situation while the point I ¼ (1,1,1,…,1) stand for the highest response in all dimensions.Statistically, the Euclidean distance, also known as the Euclidean metric is the simple distance between two points that one would calculate with a ruler and is given by the renowned Pythagorean method (i. e. A 2 ¼ B 2 þ C 2 ). Using Pythagorean equation, the Euclidean distance between two points (x and y) is line segment linking them (xy). In Cartesian coordinates, if x¼(x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ...x n ) and y¼ (y 1 , y 2 , y 3 ...y n ) are two points in Euclidean n space, then we can calculate the distance (d) between this two points as under:dðx; yÞ ¼ dðy; xÞ ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi ðx 1 À y 1 Þ 2 þ ðx 2 À y 2 Þ 2 þ ::: þ ðx n À y n Þ 2 q dðx; yÞ ¼ dðy; xÞ ¼Eq.(2) explains that in single dimension, the absolute arithmetical difference is simply the distance between two points x and y. In this case,The two dimensional Euclidean distance for x¼(x1, x2) and y¼(y1, y2) is then equal to the Pythagorean formula and is described as under:In Figure 1 , the squared length of a vector x ¼ [ x 1 x 2 ] is the sum of the squares of its coordinates (|OL| 2 is signified by the distance between points O and L and the squared distance between two vectors x ¼ [ x 1 x 2 ] and y ¼ [ y 1 y 2 ]is the sum of squared differences in their coordinates. As shown in Figure 1 , |LM| 2 is the distance between points L and M. Therefore, distance between vector x and y can be computed as follows:Where d2 (x,y) denotes to the distance between vectors x and y. Now, taking square root of each side,This two dimensional theorem can be extended to vectors with three dimensional point x ¼ [ x 1 x 2 x 3 ] and y ¼ [ y 1 y 2 y 2 ]. To do the same, first we consider following Figure 2 as a room where corner point 'O' stands for the origin. Three coordinates are symbolized by points A, B and C along the Axis 1, Axis 2 and Axis 3 respectively and 90 angles AOB, AOC and COB. Now, we can employ Pythagoras' theorem as under:We apply Pythagoras' theorem twice since for jOLj 2 it is right angled at point 'E' and for jOEj 2 it is right angled at point 'A'. Thus, from Figure 2 we can writeThus, we see squared length of 'x' is the sum of its three squared coordinates and thusNow, in Figure 2 , if we place a point, say 'M' to represent another vector 'y', this will enable us to calculate the distance between x and y as under:Which follows that in general, for n-dimension, the Euclidean distance could be calculated as under:This Eq. (7) is equivalent to Eq. (2). Now, we apply Displaced Ideal (DI) technique recommended by Zelany (1974) . DI technique assumes that the lower the distance from the ideal point, the improved the performance of a system. Usually the ideal point is 1.00 and in our proposed index the ideal point is also 1.00 which indicates complete economic stimulus. Applying Displaced Ideal (DI) method we proceed as follows:Employing normalized inverse Euclidean distance of the point D i from the ideal point I¼ (1, 1, 1….1), the Index of Economic Stimulus, IES i for the i th country, then, is computed as follows:In above Eq. (9), the inverse normalized distance is observed by normalizing the Euclidean distance of Di from the ideal point I, the numerator of the second component, by n and then subtracting by 1. The aim of normalization is to make sure the value lie between 0 and 1 and the inverse distance is calculated to mirror that the upper value of the ICES refers to higher economic stimulus.Alternatively, there are other methods of constructing an index. One of those methods is construction of index based on principal component analysis. Principal component Analysis, PCA, is a multivariate statistical technique applied to decrease the number of variables in a data set into a lesser number of 'dimensions'. In mathematical terms, from an initial set of n correlated variables, PCA forms uncorrelated indices, where each component is a linear weighted mixture of the initial variables. The weightiness for every principal component are given by the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix, or the co-variance matrix. The components are ordered in such a way so that the first component, PC1, describes the biggest likely amount of variation in the main data. The next component, PC2, is absolutely uncorrelated with the first component, and elucidates added but less variation than the PC1. Successive components are uncorrelated with preceding components; consequently, every component captures an added dimension in the data, while explaining lesser and lesser magnitudes of the variation of the original variables. However, PCA methods has some issues that must be taken into account. First of all, index based on PCA is often elitist with a solid propensity to represent extremely inter-correlated indicators and to disregard the others. So many highly imperative but poorly inter-correlated indicators may not be considered by the composite index. Secondly, PCA is a recklessly pragmatist technique based on the correlations and it overlooks the divergence of the distinct indicators. Thirdly, the amount of variance accounted for, and the weightiness calculated by PCA change over time. Thus, the outcomes of different PCAs are not straightforwardly analogous (Vyas and Kumaranayake, 2006) . A composite and robust stimulus index should comprise as many dimensions as conceivable; the index should be easy and simple to compute and should be comparable across countries or regions (Sarma, 2015) . To develop the present economic stimulus index, based on availability of data, we consider three dimensions of economic stimulus: fiscal policy, monetary policy and exchange rate policy as presented in Table 1 . We assigned equal weight to each indicator and each dimension on the argument that the variables considered to develop the proposed index in pandemic situations all stimulus are equally important.Therefore, considering the above explained dimensions -Fiscal policy, Monetary policy and Balance of payment/Exchange rate policy -The ICES value for the country i is measured by the normalized inverse Euclidean distance of the point (f i , m i e i ) from the ideal point (1, 1, 1). Mathematically,The proposed Index theoretically takes values between Zero (0) and one (1). The value zero could be described as the status of 'no economic stimulus' and the value 1 as 'complete economic stimulus'. For analytical purpose, following the work of (Sarma, 2015) and recognizing the importance of economic policy response to pandemic situations of present world, countries are given categories of low response to COVID-19 group, medium response to COVID-19 group and high response to COVID-19 group depending on their ICES values which is presented in Table 2 .Our formula to calculate dimension index (Eq. 1) is similar to the procedure applied in developing HDI. However, we contrast from HDI in that we apply empirically observed minimum and maximum values while HDI applies pre-determined values for maximum and minimum. In the second step, instead of considering geometric mean (as employed in the last stage of HDI index), we employ Displaced Ideal (DI) technique advised by (Zelany, 1974) .Proposed index is different from Elgin et al. (2020) where authors applied principal component analysis to calculate the weight of the dimension value. By assigning differentiated weight to different dimension, authors ignores the real importance of every single stimulus in times global pandemics. Ignoring the equal importance to a stimulus might produce multiplicative complexities. Also, authors produce negative value of stimulus index, though not explained what it implies. Thus, we employed Euclidean distance formula so that any economic stimulus could take positive value.In order to determine the extent of economic stimulus for COVID-19 in all 168 countries, the present study gathered and used monthly data from June, 2020 to September, 2020 available from the International Monetary Fund (IMF COVID-19 Policy Tracker, 2020). This policy response tracker focuses on discretionary actions and might not fully reflect the policies taken by countries in response to COVID-19, such as automatic insurance mechanisms and existing social safety nets which differ across countries in their breadth and scope. Besides economic policy measures mentioned and explained in Table 1 , we further examine the extent to which countries' economic responses are shaped by numerous country features, COVID-19 allied variables and public health measures. Using different sources, we gathered data on public health measures and pandemic-related variables. We gathered data on median age of countries in 2019. We also considered number of hospital beds per 1000 people, current health expenditure of countries as a ratio of GDP and collected data from World Bank and data on COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index of (Hale, Webster, Petherick, Phillips and Kira 2020) has been collected. Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics of economic variables used in this study along with the index of COVID-19 economic stimulus (ICES). According to Table 3 , on average countries have undertaken economic stimulus packages of 0.24 herein referred as low stated, with a minimum of 0.05 and maximum of 0.49 with a standard deviation of 0.09. We find on average 5.38% fiscal policy measures have been undertaken by countries where maximum is 42.20% and minimum is 5% and a standard deviation of 5.82%. In case of interest rate cut, we observe a mean value of 13.01 with a higher standard deviation of 26.52. This is evident as because there are 168 countries with significant interest rate cuts. In response to COVID-19, countries undertook macro-financial packages of 5.41% of GDP where we find the maximum 49.98% and minimum 0.00 along with a standard deviation of 8.30%. This is because a number of countries have not yet adopted adequate macro-financial packages. In case of other BOP measures, we find a mean value of 0.29 with a maximum value of 1.00. Table 6 , provided in appendix, exhibits results of computed ICES values for the four months along with country rank and status separately in response to COVID-19 over the period of June, 2020 to September, 2020 where ICES 1 is the index value of COVID-19 Economic Stimulus in the month of June, 2020; ICES 2 is the index value of COVID-19 Economic Stimulus in July, 2020; ICES 3 is the index value of COVID-19 Economic Stimulus in August, 2020 and ICES 4 is the index value of COVID-19 Economic Stimulus in September, 2020.According to findings provided in Table 6 , across all countries, in June, 2020, 70 countries' response was medium level where Switzerland, Croatia, Thailand, Slovenia, and Chile's policy response to COVID-19 pandemic ranked 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd , 4 th and 5 th respectively and 98 countries response was low level. In the month of July, 2020, Chile's policy response to COVID-19 pandemic was high and Croatia, Switzerland, Sweden and Netherland have improved economic policy response to COVID-19 pandemic and ranked as 2 nd , 3 rd , 4 th and 5 th respectively. Meanwhile 65 countries economic policy response was at medium level and 102 countries response was at low level. Thus, comparing to the June, 2020, in July 2020 countries were responded more. This is because of the fact that destructive effects of COVID-19 was more in the July, 2020 and to combat the negative effects, countries' economic policy response were more than that of the June, 2020. Similarly in the August 2020, we found comparing to other countries, Chile, Switzerland, Croatia, Sweden and Netherland responded more to COVID-19 pandemic and ranked as 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd , 4 th and 5 th respectively. We also found that 65 countries economic policy response was at medium level and 103 countries response was at low level. So, comparing to June and July, 2020, in August, 2020 countries' policy responses were more as their ICES 3 score have improved. Similarly, in September, 2020 we found Croatia's policy response to COVID-19 pandemic was high and Sweden, Switzerland, Chile, and Note: ** and * denotes significant at 5% and 10% level of significance respectively. Source: Author's computations Note: ***, **, and * signifies variables significant at 1%, 5% and 10% level of significance respectively. Source: Author's computations.Md.N.A. Siddik Heliyon 6 (2020) e05634Netherland responded more to COVID-19 pandemic and ranked as 2 nd , 3 rd , 4 th and 5 th respectively. We also found that 75 countries economic policy response was at medium level and 92 countries response was at low level. From the viewpoint of status of the countries responding to COVID-19, there is only two countries achieved 'High' specifically, in the month of July, Chile and in month September, 2020, Croatia responded highly to the COVID-19 by providing more economic stimulus packages resultant is that they were able to control the negative effects of COVI-19 pandemic. We also found that in 'Medium' stated response to COVID-19, Sweden, Switzerland, Netherland, and Croatia always were top of all 'Medium' stated response to COVID-19 countries and their ICES scores are gradually improving which confirms that they provide more stimulus packages to curb the effects of COVID-19. Among the 'Low' stated response to COVI-19 countries, one worth finding is that though they achieved low status but their scores are improving in some countries for example, Afghanistan, Albania, which refers that they are trying their level best to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 pandemic.In sum, one interesting finding is that over the time, as the situation worsen, countries tried to provide more economic stimulus packages to mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 pandemic. Another interesting finding is that, although these medium stated countries response to COVID-19 were well, still they are far from the full economic stimulus state with an ICES score of 1.00. However, looking at ICES scores over the period of four months from June to September, 2020, we can say in most cases ICES score has improved which specifies that extent of economic stimulus package in response to COVID-19 in a country has increased. It may be that the improvement was not significant to change the respective country's ranking or status of economic stimulus, but it has moved gradually to the ideal point 1.00.Factors that affect the process of economic stimulus as a response to COVID-19 pandemic are possible to be numerous and interaction among them is complex. For simplification, we attempt to simply identify factors those are correlated with economic stimulus packages provided in response to COVID-19 pandemic. To do the same, we first, calculate the magnitude of the associations through measuring correlations among variables and then conduct the beta regression method with our computed ICES as the dependent variable and country features, public health measures and GDP per capita as independent variable. We have applied beta regression method as it estimates the parameters of a beta regression model. Also, this model accommodates dependent variables that are greater than 0 and less than 1 (Ferrari and Cribari-Neto, 2004) . In this research, dependent variable is ICES which in all cases takes a value of greater than 0 and less than 1. Table 4 exhibits the correlations among variables. According to Table 4 , we found that all explanatory variables are significantly correlated with dependent variable, ICES. Correlations among explanatory variables are not significant which indicates low level of multicollinearity.In Table 5 , we report the outcomes of beta regression analyses, from column 2 to column 3 and marginal effects, dy/dx in column 4 to column 5 to report change in the outcome variable, economic stimulus, for a change in the covariates. Since the variables are scaled differently, we report outcomes in the form of a one standard deviation change in the variables. Empirical results presented in Table 5 indicate that the median age of population has noteworthy positive association with economic stimulus in response to COVID-19 pandemic which in other words means that countries with older people announced greater economic stimulus packages as a response to COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings are similar to the findings of (Elgin et al., 2020; Renzaho, 2020) .Findings exhibited in Table 5 also indicate that number of hospital beds per-capita has significant negative association with ICES score which is similar to the findings of Elgin et al. (2020) . This result implies that countries with lower number of hospital beds per-capita undertaken more stringent economic stimulus packages. For example, Chile with a 2.2 number of hospital beds per capita provides more stimulus and thus achieved 'High' status in September, 2020 and one of the top five 'medium' stated response countries during the period of the study whereas for the same period, Japan whose number of hospital beds per capita is 13.4 but was 'Low' stated response countries to COVID-19. We include total cases per million population as independent variable in our study. Findings presented in Table 5 indicates that there is significant positive association between total COVID-19 cases and economic stimulus provided in response to COVID-19 pandemic. In other words, countries with higher number of confirmed cases provide more economic stimulus. This result is consistent with the findings of (Elgin et al., 2020) . Another variable, namely GDP per capita has been included to examine the relation between GDP per capita and economic stimulus provided in response to COVID-19. According to Table 5 , we find a positive significant ratio of GDP per capita to stimulus packages similar to the results of (Sarkodie and Owusu, 2020) . This is because COVID-19 is a pandemic and thus to mitigate the negative effects, countries must provide sufficient economic stimulus regardless of their GDP. We also considered health expenditure in beta regression model. Empirical findings shown Table 5 indicate that health expenditure has significant positive association with economic stimulus packages provided for COVID-19 pandemic. This finding is similar to the results of (Benmelech and Tzur-Ilan, 2020) . Finally, COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index produced by published by the University of Oxford (Hale, Webster, Petherick, Phillips and Kira, 2020) . Findings indicate a positive association of stringency index with COVID-19 economic stimulus packages.Results of marginal effects exhibited in column 4 of Table 5 indicate that median age increases economic stimulus by 0.0048 while hospital beds decreases economic stimulus by 0.0071. Similarly we find that total number of cases, GDP per-capita, health expenditure, and COVID-19 Government response stringency index increases economic stimulus by 0.0010, 0.1005, 0.1140, and 0.0008 respectively.In this study we have measured extent of economic policy responses to COVID-19 and status and progress of economic stimulus in 168 countries across the world and then identified factors associated with such economic stimulus. To measure the extent of economic stimulus of a country, we developed a composite, three dimensional index of COVID-19 economic stimulus, ICES, which is similar but not same to the common and valuable development indexes such as HDI and HPI. Categorizing the countries as low, medium and high response group to COVID-19, this study found Chile, Switzerland, Croatia, Sweden and Netherland responded more during the period of study. Empirical findings also explored that most of the country's economic stimulus package was enhanced over the period of June to September, 2020, though that improvement was not significant to change their status from low to medium to high response group. After measuring the index of COVID-19 economic stimulus, we have conducted beta regression analysis to identify determinants of economic stimulus for COVID-19. Empirical findings of this study show that country features such as median age, hospital beds per-capita, and total cases of COVID-19 pandemic, GDP, health expenditure and COVID-19 government stringency index are the significant determinants of economic stimulus. On the basis of empirical findings of this study, policymakers should focus on the determinants of economic stimulus of COVID-19, design more economic stimulus packages in such a way so that they would be able to mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 pandemic.The main challenge we confronted in this study is data limitation. Once the data on more number of variables and on more countries would be available, future researches could be conducted by adding more indicators or dimensions to the index that will make the index more inclusive. Another limitation is the shorter study period, four months only. Only four months data may not represent the whole scenario precisely. In addition, these findings may not persist in future as the countries may announce more (or less) economic stimulus depending on the respective country's specific needs in specific times. Thus, future researches can be conducted on longer period of data to reflect the whole scenario. In a similar fashion, future researches could use more number of variables to identify the determinants of economic stimulus provided to mitigate the negative effects of a pandemic like COVID-19. Once such an index with more number of factors would be developed in future, governments can use the index to curb the effects of pandemics by providing appropriately sufficient economic stimulus packages.Author contribution statement Md.

47eb34ab288c9796fd338b7e3eb8a97f3ffb07e1,Unraveling COVID-19-related hospital costs: The impact of clinical and demographic conditions,"What are the COVID-19 hospitalization-related costs?In this prospective cohort that was carried out in a single reference quaternary center designated for the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19, more than three thousand patients were included, and their costs of hospitalization were found to be directly related to the age and comorbidities.The costs were more than 50% higher in older patients, 10-24% higher in patients with comorbidities, and 24-200% higher when additional therapeutic procedures were required.Determining the disease-associated costs is the first step in conducting future evaluations of the cost-effectiveness of treatments and vaccination programs, supporting their implementation with a comprehensive population-based approach.This was an economic prospective observational cohort study conducted at the HCFMUSP. All consecutive patients admitted from March 30 to June 30, 2020 with suspected, probable or confirmed COVID-19 [8, 9] were included and followed until discharge, death, or external transfer. The study end date was standardized as August 25, 2020. The research protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee (CAPPESQ: #4.107.580).Data were obtained as part of the routine clinical care provided (routine-care-based cohort) andwere extracted from patients' electronic health records (EHR) onto standardized forms by trained extractors. Variables included sex, age, COVID-19 confirmation by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or serologic tests, [10, 11] underlying medical conditions reported by patients or relatives, procedures (mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, dialysis or surgery), clinical outcome (discharge, death, external transfer or still hospitalized on August 25 th ) and patient itinerary (length of stay (LOS) in the emergency department (ED), hospital wards and ICUs for severe cases). [12] Cost analysisOther direct costs (human resources -medical staff and nonmedical staff) and the fixed costs (hospital services -laundry, food, administration, maintenance contracts, financing and general services) for each sector were apportioned by bed-day, resulting in daily medical staff, nonmedical staff and general daily cost estimates for each sector.Indirect costs that were not related to the patient's hospital admission (e.g., outpatient hospital visits, patient transportation, etc.) or the hospital´s functioning (e.g., productivity losses)were not included in this analysis.The total admission cost for each patient was estimated by (i) the daily costs calculated according to the patient's itinerary in the ED, wards and ICUs (PPE, supplies, medical staff, nonmedical staff, sector´s general daily cost) added to (ii) the direct costs measured by direct consumption (medication, laboratory tests, radiologic exams, nutrition and blood components).The total sector cost (ED, wards and ICUs) was calculated by summing all admission costs of each sector.March 30 th to June 30 th , US$1 was worth an average of R$5.55.The applied hypothesis tests considered an alpha error of 0.05. Continuous variables were compared among groups using Mann-Whitney U tests for independent samples. To obtain the adjusted impact of the interest variables on the total cost, a gamma generalized linear model (GLM) for y with a log link function was proposed. Statistical analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics v. 26.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) and R packages (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria).This study was conducted without funding.Between March 30 and June 30, 2020, 3,254 admissions of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, 54.5% of whom males, with an overall mean± standard deviation age of 58 (±18 years). COVID-19 was confirmed via RT-PCR or serologic tests in 2,512 (77.2%) patients, and the remainder were treated for presumed infections based on clinical and/or radiologic findings.Only 376 (11.6%) of the admissions were of patients with no comorbidities, and the others had 1 (23.2%), 2 or 3 (40%) or more than 3 (13.9%) comorbidities. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (48.1%), diabetes mellitus (30.5%), previous or current smoking (24.6%) and obesity (23%).The correlation between pre-existing health conditions, age and disease severity was established previously. [16, 17] Here, we describe how these variables are also related to highercosts. An increasing trend was observed with the number of comorbidities, where compared to no comorbidities (US$10,522.72), 2 or 3 comorbidities (n= 1,301) elevated the average admission cost by 16%, and >3 comorbidities (n= 452) increased it by 19%. These findings are also similar to Shandong´s report, with a 40% increase in hospital admission cost for patients with any pre-existing disease. [14] Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was also independently associated with higher admission costs and may be related to disease severity, with a higher viral load being present in more severe cases. [18, 19] Death was the admission outcome related to lower costs, probably due to limiting the LOS by occurring early in the disease course (eFigure 2).This study has some limitations: it took place in a single quaternary reference center and was performed from the hospital perspective, excluding indirect costs and additional investment in fixed capacity expansion and equipment acquisition. However, the study findings were analyzed with established, standardized, reproducible methods with the aim of supporting referral hospitals' emergency preparedness. Therefore, the prospective collection of detailed clinical data, sector itineraries, outcomes, resources used and costs for a large sample of patient hospitalizations are strengths of this study.In this single quaternary reference center, human resources accounted for the largest cost component, and ICU for the costliest sector. Total costs and average and daily estimated costs increased by 50% for older age strata, by 10-24% according to the number of comorbidities and by 24%-200% when additional therapeutic procedures were required; these costs decreased by 24% when the outcome was death.Understanding the hospital costs related to COVID-19 admission and the economic impact of the disease across different population subgroups can support the development of a comprehensive approach to hospital preparedness, decision-making and planning for future risk management, and is the first step in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of treatments and vaccination programs.",Brazil,first author,2020-12-30,12
c2b75d301563bd889c0256e6ed3771e1fa1ccdd2,SARS-CoV-2 genome diversity at the binding sites of oligonucleotides used for COVID-19 diagnosis,"The current COVID-19 pandemic that resulted from the global spreading of SARS-CoV-2 has shown the importance of fast access to reliable viral detection methods. Indeed, viral containment measures can only be effective through the fast, broad, and accurate identification of subjects who carry active infection and may be actively spreading SARS-CoV-2. In this sense, the identification and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 cases is one of the most effective means by which to halt the viral spread and to reduce the number of new cases of COVID-19 (1, 2) .RT-qPCR using primer (and probe) sets that target selected regions of the viral genome is the current gold standard and most common diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2. Hence, for high specificity and to avoid false-negatives, genomic variants need to be taken into consideration for the primer/probe designs, such that they can avoid target variations that would restrict or inhibit primer-template interaction during amplification. Due to continuous evolutionary selection by targeting sites of the viral genome, as well as viral genome drift, the primers and probes used for SARS-CoV-2 detection, as well as for other related methods like Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays or other similar approaches --should be constantly revisited in light of emerging genetic variation and fixation.Here we evaluated the binding sites of the primers/probes most commonly used for COVID-19 diagnosis, among SARS-CoV-2 genomes downloaded from the GISAID database (www.gisaid.org -as of Sept., 25th, 2020 -deposited since Dec. 2019). This enabled the investigation of viral genome evolution, diversity and variant-spreading during the COVID-19 pandemics. Our data suggests that the continued emergence of genomic variants in SARS_CoV-2 may increase false-negative rates and lead us to recommend that: i) the use of Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP-set should be immediately discontinued; ii) more than one primer/probe-set should be used to reduce the frequency of false-negatives; iii) SARS-CoV-2 genomic variability should be continuously assessed by sequencing as a means of constant monitoring variations that may affect diagnosis.We investigated the capability of 13 of the most used primer/probe sets for COVID-19 diagnosis (Table S1) , to recover SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID considering first no mismatches and also a maximum of two mismatches. After the exclusion of poor quality genomes (<29Kb and/or >5% of ambiguous 'N' bases) or missing metadata, 93,143 genomes remained (88.6%) (Fig. S1) . The places of origin and clades of these viral genomes were also considered and, in some cases, genomes from distinct locations were clustered (e.g. England and Scotland, merged as the United Kingdom). Also, only countries/clusters with at least 10 viral genomes available were evaluated.The Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP set displayed acceptable recovery rates in a few countries from Asia ( Fig. 1a and Table S2 ). Despite this, this set performs poorly in recovering most SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID. When no mismatches are allowed, recovery rates below 60% were obtained for >30 countries on three different continents (South America, Europe and Asia), including countries with significant burden such as India and Brazil (Fig. 1a) . Assuming that that two mismatches would still allow sensitive amplification, the picture is still worrisome for most regions of the world (Fig.1b) , a finding that reflects expectant evolutionary changes in this region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observe that the variants in the binding site of the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP set are more frequent in the clade GR, allowing recovery rates (no mismatches) from 80.8% in North America to 33.9% in Oceania (Table S2) . Clade O appears to concentrate variants in binding sites of US_CDC|2019-nCoV_N1 and US_CDC|2019-nCoV_N3 sets (Fig. 1a, 1c) .Other primer/probe sets also showed low recovery rates for specific regions, such as HKU-N for Brazil (total 6 variant positions distributed in primers F, R and the probe); US_CDC|2019-nCoV_N1 for Malaysia and Singapore (3 variant positions located in primer F and the probe); and US_CDC|2019-nCoV_N3 for Bahrain and Kazakhstan (7 variants for primers F, R and the probe) (Table S3) . Caution should be used as the numbers of viral genomes in GISAID are tremendously biased towards Europe and the US, and the minimum of 10 genomes used here may not reflect actual viral diversity present in some countries.Next, we investigated the temporal prevalence of each clade since the start of the pandemic. We charted significant fluctuations in clade prevalence and found SARS-CoV-2 clades G, GH and GR to have increased significantly relative to others, suggestive of positive selection of these variants (Figure 2) . These results however, can also be explained by reduced diagnostic accuracy as a consequence of the mismatched evolving target sites. Accordingly, genomic variations should be considered when primers/probes sets are to be selected.When considering the top-three countries in the world in terms of number of COVID-19 cases (USA, India and Brazil - Fig. S2 ) we see that -despite the reduced number of genomes from Brazil -the proportion of viral clades varies significantly for all these 3 countries. This result highlights the importance of considering regional and temporal clade structures for selecting primer/probe sets for diagnosis.Legend Figure 2 -Percentage of SARS-CoV-2 clades in the world according to month when the sequences were deposited in GISAID. The number of genomes from each month are indicated (parenthesis). Genomes with no information about the month in which they were sequenced (~1%) have not been considered.from New York City. Again, most mismatches were seen for the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP set, but we have also observed variations in the binding sites for the reverse primers of the US_CDC|2019-nCoV_N2 and N3 sets as well as WH_NIC sets (Fig. S3) . The most frequent SARS-CoV-2 genomic alteration affecting the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP corresponds to the 5'-end of the binding site of the forward primer (3) -a continuous stretch of three nucleotide substitutions (GGG→AAC). Viral genomes with this variation corresponded to ~13% of the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes as of 22 March 2020 (3) but have now reached ~64% of GISAID sequences. This variation found in 88% of a SARS-CoV-2 genome cohort comprised of 640 sequences from Indian patients and in all of 40 recently confirmed cases in São Paulo, Brazil. These findings provide multiple lines of evidence of these variations and their significant frequency in patient-derived samples. Whereas a scenario of high/medium viral load may not lead to false-negatives after diagnosis with this set (as the most frequent variant would affect the 5' end of the F-primer), one possibility is that in cases of low viral loads or less efficient swabbing, Ct values may be shifted above the detection threshold, leading to false-negatives and a consequent spreading of this variant. While Vogels et al. 2020 (3), argue that the precise location of this mismatched sequence may not impact COVID-19 diagnosis, the hypothesis remains to be tested.The continued evolution of the virus may result in more variants in these binding sites and other genome regions and, in this case, the continued use of the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP primer-set may increase false-negatives rates. As can be seen from Table S3 other variants in the binding sites of F and R primers of the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP set have also been detected in our analysis. Furthermore, it is relevant to document that 2/40 cases sequenced in Brazil showed two additional substitutions, one detected at the 7 th nt from the 5'end (C>A) and the other at the 4 th nt from the 3'end (G>T). These changes, which may have stronger impacts on primer efficacy -especially if combined with the more upstream mismatches, indicate that nucleotide substitutions continue to accumulate in this genome region. Importantly, none of these two extra variations have been described in this GISAID-version, further reinforcing the need to a continuous effort on cataloguing viral genome sequences.As the identification of subjects carrying SARS-CoV-2 is in itself an important barrier to the propagation of the virus, we speculate that the increased global spread of viruses carrying this variant may be a consequence of using primer/probe sets that fail to properly identify positive cases. It is worth mentioning the early use of the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP primer set in earlier manuscripts (4-7). While mass screening is needed to control the spread of the disease, the lack of proper detection of viruses carrying some variants will not only result in problems at individual/community level as well as on a global scale. Moreover, such missed diagnoses could contribute to the ongoing spread of the virus, increasing the number of new cases and deaths from COVID-19, and lead to continued pandemic spread due to misdiagnoses.The variations seen here may impact COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR, but may also impact other diagnostic approaches such as LAMP (8) and the Ion AmpliSeq™ SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel. There we observe that a synonymous variation (c.14143C>T; p.Leu4715Leu; orf1ab) in the binding site of the ORF1AB primer resulted in decreased coverage of this amplicon by 1-2 orders of magnitude (16/25 samples from a Polish clinical cohort). An analysis of GISAID genomes showed this variant to be present in 10% of Polish sequences and in about 17% of sequences from other European countries as well as other continents (Fig. S4) Conversely, our study also revealed primers that can currently be used with confidence. Using current data, we found that Paris_nCoV-IP2 and -IP4, and WHO|E_Sarbeco have shown the best performance in terms of full match to SARS-CoV-2 genomes worldwide, all capturing above 99.5% of the good quality SARS-CoV-2 viruses (Table S4) . Importantly, geographic variations need to be considered and monitored overtime, despite the good performance of these primers at this time.Although the currently observed genome variations would not always impact SARS-CoV-2 detection, since partial amplification can still occur, we propose: i) the use of more than one primer/probe set to minimize false-negative rates; ii) the use of the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP set to be discontinued; iii) the permanent sequencing surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 genome around the world, especially from non-primer-biased, environmental samples -allowing viral genome variant monitoring and the careful selection of the best primers/probes as a means to reduce false-negatives and disease spreading. The WHO_RdRP_R primer contains an error in a degenerate base at position 12 (instead of S -C/G -it is certainly a T; see (S1), leading to zero-recovery in our analysis (Fig. 1a) . The correction of this mistake would allow for recovery of 91.19% of GISAID genomes (Fig. S-MCB. 1 & S-MCB.2; see online material for detailed analysis). Extra attention should be given to this as the wrong primer sequence is still widely found in the literature.The NIID_2019-nCOV_N_R2 primer appears to have an error/typo even in the erratum where it is indicated that ""The reverse primer (NIID_2019-nCOV_N_R2) sequence should be replaced with TGGCAGCTGTGTAGGTCAAC. The corrected nucleotide is bold and underlined."" However, our analysis suggests there to be another typo and the correct primer sequence should be TGGCACCTGTGTAGGTCAAC (with the previously wrong base marked in bold and underlined). In order to highlight this discrepancy we performed our searches according to the erratum (S2).Legend Fig. S3 -Presence of variations in primer-probe regions found from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab data from New York-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine patients.

Eleven variant alleles across binding sites for 13 primer/probe-sets were detected in viral genomes isolated from patient samples, including patients who exhibited variants in the coordinates corresponding to binding sites of the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP set including the 3bp stretch of the forward primer (pos 28881-28883) and other variations along the binding site of this same forward primer (28896) as well as its reverse primer (28968 and 28969), along with variants in the binding sites for reverse primers of US_CDC|2019-nCoV_N2 (29218), US_CDC|2019-nCoV_N3 (pos 28747), WH-NIC-N (28373) and the vicinity of other primers/probes.

5c283755810f20e37ba26d690a7d97e664c24a9d,Journal Pre-proofs The experience of social distancing for families with children and adolescents during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Uruguay: Difficulties and opportunities The experience of social distancing for families with children and adolescents during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Uruguay: Difficulties and opportunities,"The authors declare no completing interests.A series of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, in the southeast of China (Lu, Stratton & Tang, 2020) . In January 2020, a new strain of coronavirus that had not been previously identified in humans (Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus-2, SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause of the outbreak (European Centre forDisease Prevention and Control, 2020a) . The infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus, named COVID-19, rapidly spread around the world and was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11th 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020a) . Given that no vaccines or specific drugs were available, classic public health measures such as physical interventions (i.e.personal hygiene, barriers and distancing) were the only tools available for interrupting and reducing the spread of the virus (Jefferson et al., 2009) . In particular, social distancing measures became the core component of the response of public health authorities worldwide to curb the pandemic of COVID-19 (Wilder-Smith & Freedman, 2020) .Social distancing, and particularly quarantine, is one of the oldest public health measures for controlling the outbreak of communicable diseases (Kilwein, 1995) . The term social distancing refers to ""efforts that aim, through a variety of means, to decrease or interrupt transmission of COVID-19 in a population (sub-) (SARS) outbreak in 2003, when individuals exposed to SARS were required to isolate themselves at home (Wilder-Smith & Freedman, 2020; Cava et al., 2005) . In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries implemented different types of social distancing measures. In the specific case of Latin America, measures ranged from nationwide curfews and lockdowns (e.g. Argentina, Chile and Peru) to softer restrictions that combined closure of educational institutions, mass gathering cancellations and stay-at-home recommendations (e.g. Uruguay and Brazil) (Costa, Olona, & Tombesi, 2020) .Social distancing measures disrupt daily life and are expected to have negative consequences on wellbeing (Dubey et al., 2020; Chu et al., 2020) . Lockdown and quarantine may directly lead to psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression and emotional fatigue, due to difficulty in coping with the constraints of the quarantine requirements in terms of isolation (Blendon et al., 2004; Cava et al., 2005; Brooks et al., 2020; Chu et al., 2020) . In addition, social distancing implies that people may be unable to conduct some of their daily routines, which may have negative consequences in perceived wellbeing. Engaging in routinized behaviors has been reported to be a route to enact important goals that create sense of purpose, being closely related to meaning in life, a cornerstone of wellbeing (Heintzelman & King, 2019) . Disruption of daily life may be particularly relevant in the case of children, causing distress and confusion. In this sense, variations in family routines have been reported to have negative effects on children's socioemotional, academic and social skill development (Spagnola & Fiese, 2007) . On the contrary, adherence to routines has been reported to be important for family resilience during times of crisis (Arlinghaus & Johnston, 2018) . Therefore, families' ability to continue with their daily life may reduce the negative psychological consequences of social distancing.In addition to the negative effects of social distancing measures, some families may also encounter positive effects. Lack of ability to conduct some of their daily activities may imply that people could have more time to conduct other activities they usually postpone, reducing feelings of time scarcity. Such feelings have been reported to be widespread in modern industrialized societies and has been linked to several psychological problems, such as stress and depression (Roxburgh, 2004; Roxburgh, 2012) . The positive effect of social distancing measures may be particularly relevant in the case of parents, given that spending quality time with children has been identified as an important aspect of the parenting experience (Roxburgh, 2004) . In this context, the aims of the present work were: (i) to explore the experiences of families with children and adolescents during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Uruguay, (ii) to compare the experiences of families from low and middle socio-economic status.the first cases of COVID-19 in the country. As of October 2020, Uruguay was the only country in Latin America that has managed to control the COVID-19 outbreak (Taylor, 2020).A convenience sample of participants was obtained using an advertisement on Facebook andInstagram. This methodological decision was based on the popularity of these social among the When participants clicked on the advertisement, they were re-directed to the server where the questionnaire was hosted (Compusense Cloud, Compusense Inc., Canada). Participants completed an online consent form. they were asked to indicate if they had experienced changes in their daily life using a closed question.Participants who answered 'Yes', were asked to describe the changes in an open-ended question.The following questions were related to their children. They were asked to describe a typical day of their children since the implementation of social distancing measures. Then, a series of closed questions were asked to explore changes implemented in relation to child-care, changes they had perceived in children's eating patterns, changes in their relationship with their children, changes in their children's mood and behavior, and their reaction to those changes. For each of the questions, they were asked to describe the changes using an open-ended question. The wording of the questions is presented in Table 1 .Insert Table 1 around hereThe percentage of participants who provided each response ('Yes'/'No') to the closed questions was calculated.Data from the open-ended questions were analyzed using content analysis based on inductive coding (Krippendorf, 2004) . For each of the questions, responses were coded into categories. The percentage of participants who provided responses within each of the categories was calculated. Examples of responses within each of the categories were selected and translated into English for publication.For each of the questions the chi-square test was used to explore the influence of socioeconomic status on the frequency of reported changes (closed questions) and on the frequency of mention of responses within each of the identified categories of the open-ended questions. When significant differences were found, chi-square per cell test was used to identify the source of variation of the global chi-square test.A total of 1725 participants completed the study. As shown in Table 2 , participants were diverse in terms of gender, age, educational level and socio-economic status (SES). The largest proportion of the participants were female, aged between 26 and 45 years old, and from low SES.Insert Table 2 around here Results showed that participants experienced major changes in their daily routines and family life. The percentage of participants who reported having experienced changes in different aspects of their life since the implementation of social distancing measures did not significantly differ between participants from low and medium SES (all p-values higher than 0.05). In the following sections, results from each of the topics included in the questionnaire are presented.As shown in Table 3 Only a minority of the participants reported having felt good, hopeful, calm, positive, or in a normal mood (Table 3) .No large differences were found in the moods and feelings reported by participants from low and medium SES. However, significant differences in the frequency of mention of the categories were found ( 2 =49.6, p<0.001). Participants from low SES reported having ""felt bad"" significantly more frequently than participants from medium SES. On the contrary, participants from medium SES reported having felt ""uncertainty"" or ""ups and downs"" more frequently than those from low SES.Insert Table 3 around hereNinety five percent of the participants reported having experienced changes in their daily routines after the implementation of social distancing measures. As expected, the most frequent response was ""staying at home"" (Table 4 ). Some participants stressed that they were not being able to see their relatives and friends, whereas others indicated that they tried not to have physical contact with other people, including their children (Table 4 ).The second most frequently mentioned change was related to work-related life. Participants referred to four types of changes: job loss, unemployment insurance or special vacation due to the coronavirus situation, impossibility of working due to the social distancing measures or changes in child-care arrangements and working from home (Table 4) . Associated with work-related changes, 9% of the participants mentioned economic changes. In particular, they referred to lack of money or changes in resource management due to the uncertainties generated by COVID-19.Participants also referred to changes in their mood and mentioned having felt negative moods and emotions, such as worry, fear, stress, anxiety and boredom (Table 4 ), in line with results reported in the previous section. The uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic and social distancing was highlighted by many participants (Table 3 ). In addition, other participants recognized feeling overwhelmed by the excess and ubiquity of the information related to the pandemic, as exemplified in the following quote: ""I am stressed by so much information in social media. I am overwhelmed. I can't even smile because I am thinking in all this"".Hygiene measures to prevent COVID-19 were identified as changes in daily life. As shown in Table 4 , participants mentioned washing their hands and cleaning their house more often. Obsession about cleaning and hygiene emerged from some of the comments: ""I can't stop cleaning and thinking about the risk"" and ""We are constantly washing our hands"". Some participants also referred to the adoption of other preventive measures, such as not touching their mouth and keeping distance from other people (Table 4 ).In addition, changes related to education were also mentioned, both in terms of their children and their own education. Some participants highlighted that their children or themselves could not attend classes due to the closure of educational institutions, whereas others reported having faced difficulties to access online classes (Table 4) .Changes in routines, habits and family life were mentioned by 10% of the participants, mainly in relation to the closure of educational institutions and the need to stay with their children at home.As shown in Table 4 , a small proportion of participants mentioned changes in organization and planning, particularly in relation to food purchase to minimize their trips to the supermarket, and changes in the environment (e.g. public transport, cancellation of medical consultations).Significant differences in the frequency of mention of responses within the identified categories were found ( 2 =23.9, p=0.031). Participants from low SES mentioned ""mood changes"" and ""economic aspects"" significantly more frequently than participants from medium SES, whereas the opposite trend was found for ""changes in organization and planning"" (Table 4) .Insert Table 4 around hereParticipants were asked to describe a typical day of their children. Table 5 presents the activities included in the descriptions. The most frequently mentioned activity was ""staying at home"", followed by ""using technology"" (e.g. computers, tablets, cellphones), ""playing"" and ""studying"".Significant differences in the frequency of mention of the different activities were found between participants from low and medium SES ( 2 =97.0, p<0.001). As shown in Table 5 , ""studying"", ""eating"", ""spending time together with the rest of the family"", ""helping with the housework"", ""practicing physical activity"" and ""using social media"" were significantly more frequently mentioned by participants from medium SES compared to those from low SES, whereas the opposite trend was found for ""being bored/uninterested"", ""being anxious/restless"" and ""asking/wanting to go out"". In addition, a trend towards a more frequent use of technology was observed in participants from medium SES.Insert Table 5 around hereThe majority of participants (83%) reported having experienced changes in child-care since the implementation of social distancing measures. The most frequent responses were related to ""personal hygiene"" (Table 6 ) as participants reported that their children more frequently wash their hands and take a bath. Participants also reported being more affectionate and protective with their children, mainly due to the fear generated by COVID-19. In relation to this point, 2% of the participants reported having less physical contact with their children (Table 6) . Responses related to social distancing were mentioned by 15% of the participants, who stressed that their children could not see friends or other family members due to movement restrictions.According to chi-square test, the frequency of mention of responses within the identified categories significantly differed between participants from low and medium SES ( 2 =51.5, p<0.001).Participants from low SES tended to mention responses related to ""personal hygiene"" more often than participants from medium SES, whereas the opposite trend was found for the categories related to ""spending more time together"", ""changes in daily routines"", ""changes in child-care arrangements"" and ""difficulties in relation to child-care arrangements"".Insert Table 6 around hereWhen asked about the existence of changes in their children's eating patterns, 37% responded affirmatively. The most frequently mentioned change was ""lack of sufficient food"", particularly among low SES participants (Table 7) . The rest of the changes were mainly related to the quantity and quality of food consumed.Changes in the quantity of food consumed were mentioned by 23% of the participants: 19% stated that their children were eating more, whereas 4% stated that they were eating less. Several participants associated changes in the quantity of food consumed to emotional aspects. Anxiety and boredom were associated with eating more, whereas eating less was associated with sadness and the fact that children miss their usual activities (e.g. school) and their friends.Changes in the quality of the foods consumed were mostly positive. As shown in Table 7 , participants reported that children were eating healthier, eating more healthy foods (e.g. fruits,vegetables, pulses, water) and eating less unhealthy foods (e.g. soda, ultra-processed milk desserts).The reasons for these changes emerged from the responses and were mainly related to the fact that parents stayed at home and had more time to cook at home and the concern to keep children healthy to protect them from COVID-19.However, a minority of participants reported that negative changes in diet quality through a decrease in the consumption of healthy foods and an increase in the consumption of ultra-processed products (Table 7) . Several factors underlie these changes, such as lack of money, the decision to minimize trips to the supermarket, and emotional aspects (e.g. boredom).Significant differences in the frequency of mention of responses within the different categories were found ( 2 =59.8, p<0.001). Apart from the previously described difference in the category ""lack of sufficient food"", participants from medium SES mentioned responses within the categories ""more home-made food"" and ""less ultra-processed products"" significantly more often than participants from low SES (Table 7) .Insert Table 7 around hereForty-one percent of the participants reported having experienced changes in the relationship with their children. As shown in Table 8 , most of the changes were positive as participants mentioned ""spending more time together"", ""familiar bond"", ""more communication"" between family members, and doing ""more family activities"" together. On the contrary, a small proportion of participants referred to negative changes in their relationship, such as ""less physical contact"" to avoid the risk of contagion, tense family relationships due to ""stress and fear"", and ""more arguments and fights"" (Table 8) . No significant differences in the frequency of mention of responses related to the identified categories were found ( 2 =8.1, p=0.520).Insert Table 8 around hereChanges in children's mood and behavior were reported by 56% of the participants. As shown in Table 9 , most of the changes were related to negative moods and emotions, including ""boredom"", ""fear"", ""stress"", ""anger"", ""anxiety"", ""agitation"" and ""restlessness"". Only a small proportion of participants reported positive changes, such as ""happiness"", ""maturity"" and ""increased familiar bond"".Participants from low SES reported that their children were ""more demanding"" significantly more frequently than participants from medium SES and that their children had ""abrupt mood changes"" or were ""disoriented"" and more mature significantly less frequently ( 2 =49.0, p<0.001).Insert Table 9 around here Most participants reported a positive reaction to the changes in children's mood and behavior (Table 10) . Participants stated that they tried to talk to their children to explain the situation and help them understand why they should stay at home: ""I try to talk to them and explain them what we are living, without scaring them"", ""I try to find strategies to talk to them"". They also reported trying to reassure their children by spending more time with them, as exemplified in the following quotes: ""I try to interact, to play more, to do things we didn't do often"", ""Playing with them"", ""Every day I try to have different activities to do all together"". ""Patience"", ""calm"" and ""understanding"" were frequently mentioned reactions (Table 10) .However, some participants reported having faced ""difficulties to handle the situation"" and having felt worry, stress, sadness and anger in responses to their children's mood and behavior (Table   10 ). Examples of negative reactions are provided in the following quotes: ""Sometimes I shout at them"", ""Without much patience. I'm in a bad mood since this started. I haven't been able to do anything on my own. I can't even take a bath"", ""Arguing, shouting, punishment"".The frequency of mention of responses within the identified categories did not significantly differ between participants from low and medium SES ( 2 =21.4, p=0.124).Insert Table 10 around hereResults from the present work showed that Uruguayan citizens frequently reported having experienced psychological distress and emotional disturbance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures. Negative feelings such as worry, fear, anxiety, anguish and sadness were the most frequent. Children were also reported to suffer psychological distress, as they were said to frequently experience boredom, fear and stress. These results are in agreement with results from studies conducted in other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic (Haesebaert et al., 2020; Kimhi et al., 2020; Ran et al., 2020) . Although rejection and stigma have been frequently reported in the context of quarantine (Blendon et al., 2004; Cava et al., 2005) , they did not emerge in the present work given that participants had not been infected with COVID-19. The main factors responsible for emotional disturbance mentioned by participants were fears about themselves or their loved ones getting infected; job loss and financial difficulties; uncertainty over the duration of social distancing measures; confinement; loss of usual routine; and reduced social contact with others.As expected, social distancing measures caused a major disruption of daily habits and routines. Almost half of the participants spontaneously mentioned staying at home as one of the changes in their daily life. This is an interesting finding given that, at the time of the study, the Uruguayan government had not implemented compulsory curfews and lockdowns. Therefore, these results suggest a good level of adherence to the stay-at-home recommendation issued by the government.Changes in work-related activities were one of the most frequently mentioned contributors to the disruption of daily routines. Participants reported having lost their job, being under the unemployment insurance, being unable to work or being working from home. People being unable to work with no advance planning has been previously reported as a major consequence of quarantine that causes long-lasting socioeconomic distress (Brooks et al., 2020) . Changes in work-related life were associated with financial losses, concern about the future economic situation and lack of sufficient food in the household, mainly for participants from low SES.Participants mentioned hygiene and cleaning activities as a change in their daily routines and a major change in child-care arrangements. They reported to wash their hands and to clean and disinfect their house more frequently, in line with public health recommendations for preventing COVID-19 (World Health Organization, 2020b) . Mass communication campaigns have had a strong focus on hygiene (Ministerio de Salud Pública, 2020). Such campaigns seemed to have triggered some compulsions and obsessions over hygiene in some people. In the present work, obsessive behaviors, such as thinking about cleaning all the time and asking their children to change their clothes three times a day, were identified. This suggests the need to implement actions to help people to find a balance and to ask for help if hygiene-related activities interfere with their daily functioning in life. In a similar vein, some participants seemed to over-interpret social distancing recommendations as they reported to avoid physical contact with their children, which triggered additional emotional disturbance.This may be particularly relevant among people with low educational level.The closure of educational institutions forced most parents to introduce changes in child-care arrangements. Participants stated that they were spending more time with their children, which in some cases implied that one of the parents was unable to work. (2020) the COVID-19 pandemic will reduce 30% the learning gains of US students relative to a typical school year. This effect is expected to be larger among children from low SES, given the inequities that already exist in academic achievement (INEEd, 2019) . Results from the present work provides support for this hypothesis as participants from low SES mentioned educational activities less frequently than participants from medium SES when describing a typical day of their children.Policymakers, educators and families should develop strategies to provide support to children during and after the disruption caused by COVID-19, particularly among the most vulnerable sectors of the society.Participants from low SES reported more difficulties to cope with social distancing measures compared to participants from medium SES. This result fits expectations and is in agreement with research conducted during the SARS outbreak which showed that quarantine had more adverse effects on socially and economically disadvantaged people (Basrur et al., 2004; Leung & Guan, 2004; Brooks et al., 2020) . Economic difficulties were identified as one of the best predictors for the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on distress symptoms and perceived danged by Kimhi et al. (2020) . In the present work, the economic consequences of social distancing measures were more pronounced for low SES participants, who reported negative feelings (e.g. feeling bad) and difficulties to cope with the situation more often than medium SES participants. On the contrary, participants from medium SES reported difficulties to implement changes in child-care, which can be related to the fact that medium SES have been reported to work outside their house more frequently compared to mothers low SES (Ministerio de Desarrollo Social, 2018) . Therefore, the most vulnerable segments of the Uruguayan population seem to be disproportionally affected by the economic and psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. These results contribute to the increasing body of knowledge that shows that COVID-19 exacerbates existing social inequalities (de Souza et al., 2020; Yi et al., 2020) .Results from the present work suggest that financial compensations for the financial losses incurred should be an essential component of the governmental response to COVID-19. Emphasis should be placed on people from low SES and on those who completely lose their earnings due to the pandemic situation (e.g. self-employed people or people who do not receive any paid leave). Financial aid should minimize the risk of food insecurity and assure access to sufficient quantity of healthy food.Secondly, the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures deserve special attention. Official communications should try to keep a balance between encouraging people to engage in preventive measures and eliciting excessive fear and worry. Hopeful messages in official communications could potentially contribute to reduce the uncertainty and fear elicited by the pandemic. Effective mitigation strategies should be implemented both during social distancing and once it has finished. Practical recommendations for people to cope with boredom and isolation could have a positive effect (Brooks et al., 2020) . Results from the present work suggest that people from low SES may be more prone to psychological distress as they need to simultaneously cope with the fear of getting infected, the impact of social distancing on their daily routines and economic difficulties to cope with the situation. In addition, the findings stress the need to develop mitigation strategies targeted at children, as they seem to frequently suffer the psychological consequences of social distancing.Thirdly, strategies to mitigate the impact of social distancing on children's academic achievement should also be an integral part of the governmental response to COVID-19.Communication to parents could contribute to motivate their children to get back on track academically. In addition, educators should develop effective approaches to catch students up once educational institutions reintroduce face-to-face lessons.Finally, an interesting finding of the present work was that COVID-19 and social distancing measures triggered positive changes in some families, particularly in terms of family relationships and eating patterns. This suggests that COVID-19 may provide people more time to perform some activities they enjoy. In this regard, parents have reported lacking the opportunity to invest enough quality time with their children (Roxburgh, 2012) . Similarly, lack of time has been identified as a major barrier for healthy eating among Uruguayan citizens (Machín et al., 2018) . On this basis, COVID-19 may provide some families the opportunity to rethink some of their habits and daily routines. Changes in the circumstances have been reported to trigger a disruption in habitual behaviours if individuals have the intention to introduce changes (Wood, Tam, & Witt, 2005) . Communication campaigns after the pandemic can reinforce this aspect and encourage people to stick to the positive changes they have implemented. In this sense, one of the areas that deserves special attention is related to children's eating patterns. Some of the participants reported an improvement in the healthiness of their diet, and particularly an increase in the consumption of fruits, vegetables and pulses. This is highly relevant considering that consumption of these foods among Uruguayan children is lower than nutritional recommendations (Ministerio de Desarrollo Social, 2018) . Therefore, strategies to make the positive changes in eating patterns caused by COVID-19 long lasting, could have a constructive public health impact.Results from the present work showed that the social distancing measures implemented to contain the COVID-19 outbreak in Uruguay caused a major disruption in daily habits, which were mostly attributed to changes in work-related activities and the closure of educational institutions.Difficulties to cope with such changes and the fear and uncertainty caused by COVID-19 were identified.

In Latin America over 12 million cases of COVID-19 and 400,000 deaths were recorded 70 up to November 2020, making it one of the regions most affected (3) .The measures to control the spread of COVID-19, such as confinement, have brought about changes 72 in the routine of life of the population that could affect their mental health (4, 5). A recent review study 73 reported prevalences of anxious and depressive symptoms in the population in ranges of 6-50% and 74 14-48% respectively (6) . Some factors have been associated with a decline in mental health during 75 the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, people with low economic status, women, and the 76 unemployed have experienced greater mental health problems (7, 8) . In contrast, a study in China 77 found that the population with depressive symptoms reported a lower quality of life (9). To date, few 78 studies have reported on the COVID-19 pandemic and depressive symptoms and quality of life (QoL) 79 in students despite the fact that the pandemic has severely affected various parts of the world 80The rapid transmission of COVID-19 led to the suspension of face-to-face academic activities, 81 affecting 91.3% of the world's student population, who had to adapt quickly to non-face-to-face 82 education (10). However, this abrupt transition has led to increased stress, insomnia, anxiety and 83 depression in students, so that their quality of life and mental health may have deteriorated (11) (12) (13) .Peru reported the first case of COVID-19 on 06 March 2020 and 10 days later a state of national 85 emergency and compulsory social isolation (confinement) was declared (14), but the virus spread 86 rapidly throughout the country. A total of 950, 557 people were infected by 641 87 deaths were recorded in the country as of 24 November 2020 (15).The confinement affected the economy of the families and brought anguish to the students of Peru, 89 due to the economic difficulties and digital gaps (connectivity, computers), which caused the 90 government to implement economic policies to the Peruvian families and the education sector such 91 as economic bonds, educational credits, connectivity and scholarships (16) With respect to the depressive symptoms variable, the Patient Health Questionarie-9 (PHQ-9) was 135 used. It is a self-administered questionnaire of 9 items with 4 levels of response according to the 136 frequency of depressive symptoms within the last 2 weeks: nothing, several days, more than half the 137 days and almost every day. This questionnaire is validated in the Peruvian population presenting 138 adequate indicators of psychometric properties and reliability (α = 0.87) (23). The summed score is 139 within the range 0 to 27 points. Likewise, depressive symptoms are reported according to levels of 140 severity: minimal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), moderately severe (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) and severe (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) 141 (24) (25) (26) .The covariates that participated in the study were: age (in tertiles), sex (male or female), department (Table 3) . have family members with chronic diseases (β=-3.7, IC95%=-6.1 to -1.4) had significantly lower 209 scores than people without these characteristics. Finally, it was reported that increasing 1 depressive 210 symptom score reduced the quality of life score by 2 (β=-2.0, IC95%=-2.2 to -1.8) (Table 4 ). Students residing in the department of Piura and Ayacucho reported lower and higher scores for 278 depressive symptoms than residents of Ancash, respectively. This could be explained by the fact that 279 during the months of evaluation of our study, the rate of COVID-19 infections and deaths in Piura had 280 fallen, while in Ayacucho, a rural area of Peru, it was at its highest peak (53). The score of depressive 281 symptoms was higher in women than in men; this is in line with a recent review study reporting gender 282 differences in depression during . This is probably due to the fact that women are 283 currently having more responsibilities within the work environment and during confinement the family 284 burden (e.g. family caregivers) has increased, generating greater stress and depression(55,56).Students who left home during quarantine or had a family member with a chronic illness scored higher 286 on depressive symptoms than those who did not have these characteristics, this finding could be due 287 to the concern about catching and/or infecting at-risk family members during exposure to VOC-19 288 (57).The findings in this study suggest the need to implement prevention and intervention strategies to ",Peru,abstract,2020-12-04,12
c435c1710782cbd30ef17d9de71d6476e76fc2a3,Extraction-free protocol combining Proteinase K and heat inactivation for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR,"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by SARS-CoV-2, was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 . Confronted by the lack of a vaccine or specific treatment, early detection, isolation and contact tracing are fundamental strategies for reducing the spread of this disease [1] .RT-qPCR is the gold standard method for SARS-CoV-2 determinations [2] . These assays typically involve collecting the clinical specimen usually with nasopharyngeal swabs, extracting the RNA from the sample and analyzing the presence of the viral RNA through RT-qPCR.Nowadays, the RNA extraction step is considered a bottleneck of SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR determinations [3] . This procedure can be automatized but commercial extraction robots are very expensive and may not be affordable for most clinical labs in low-income countries. In contrast, manual RNA-extraction is a quite cumbersome procedure that includes several washing and centrifuging steps at a Biosafety level 2 laboratory and relatively expensive extraction kits. In Argentina, a trained lab technician processes approximately 24 samples every 1.5 hours.Additionally, the skyrocketing increment on the clinical use of RT-qPCR due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a worldwide shortage of RNA purification reagents [4, 5] thus, many research groups around the world have concentrated their efforts on either simplifying or eliminating the extraction step [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .Many protocols traditionally used for extraction-free preparation of clinical samples included treatments with proteinase-K (PK), a commonly used protease that degrade RNases and hence, it helps to preserve RNA integrity [19, 20] . A recent work suggested that PK may facilitate extractionfree determinations of SARS-CoV-2 although a major loss in sensitivity with a 6-units shift in CT values on the determination of the envelope (E) gene [21] may prevent its uses in clinical analysis.Other recent preprint [22] tested a protocol based on PK and heat inactivation using a reduced number of samples (N=17) in UTM medium with relative low CT values, and claim a good sensitivity on the determination of the E gene. Although these results might seem contradictory with recent findings showing suboptimal detection of the E amplicon on HID samples in UTM medium [17] , the efficiency of the PCR is very dependent on the detection kit, transport medium brand, thermocycler, etc.Here, we combined these strategies and optimized the PK+HID method, a very simple protocol for extraction-free RT-qPCR determinations of SARS-CoV-2. Our results position PK+HID as an inexpensive, versatile and reliable alternative to bypass the traditional RNA extraction procedure and suggest that it could substantially contribute to improve the testing capacity in countries with limited resources and facilities.GeneFinder detection kits were analyzed with the CFX Manager software (BioRad) to obtain CT values. Data obtained with 2019-nCoV CDC were analyzed with the free software LinRegPCR [23] to obtain CT values. This software was also used to calculate PCR efficiencies and the initial amount of template copies (in arbitrary units).We used a reduced number of SARS-CoV-2 positive (N=6) and negative (N=3) nasopharyngeal swab samples collected in saline solution to test if their preincubation with PK before the thermal inactivation step improves the performance of the HID extraction-free method. Although previous results [17] suggested that saline solution is suboptimal for direct RT-qPCR detection, this is one of the transport medium recommended by CDC and it is also commonly used to collect clinical samples in Argentina.In these experiments, we mixed up 90 μl of the samples with 10 μl of PK 10 mg/ml (final concentration 1 mg/ml) in 0.2 ml PCR tubes and incubated them in a thermocycler during 15 min at 55°C followed by 5 min at 98°C (PK+HID samples). As controls, we used heat-inactivated aliquots omitting the preincubation with PK at 55°C (HID samples) and RNA samples obtained through a standard extraction protocol (purified RNA samples) from the same nasopharyngeal swabs. These samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR using the 2019-nCoV CDC Diagnostic Panel which detects the N1 and N2 viral regions and the human RNase P (RP) gene as internal control. Table) .The analysis of the amplification curves shows that the PCR efficiency (EPCR) was the lowest for the HID treatment followed by PK+HID and then by the RNA extraction treatment (Fig 1c) . This result suggests that the PK treatment may contribute to degrade unknown components of the sample matrix that interfere with RT-qPCR. Additionally, we observed a higher PCR amplification efficiency for the N1 viral gene compared to N2, in line with previous results [17, 24] . We also analyzed the amount of amplicon copies in PK+HID relative to that determined in HID samples and observed that this ratio was higher than 1 for N2 and RP suggesting that PK treatment also protected these RNA regions from RNase´s action (Fig 1d) .PK+HID involves the addition of the PK buffer and thus a 10 % dilution of the saline medium used to collect nasopharyngeal swabs. Therefore, we next evaluate if the improvement of PK+HID treatment compared to heat-inactivation is only due to the dilution of the saline medium. We analyzed five positive samples processed by the standard PK+HID protocol or by HID but adding to the samples the same amount of PK buffer without PK (HID´ samples). S2 Fig shows that CT values for PK+HID samples were lower compared to HID´ samples; the analyses of amplification curves indicate that nPK+HD was higher than nHID´ supporting that PK contributes with the preservation of the integrity of the viral RNA. Therefore, the dilution of saline solution could not completely explain the better performance of PK+HID. Nevertheless, the efficiency of PCR amplification for HID´ samples was slightly lower only for N2 amplicon suggesting that the dilution of saline solution in PK+HID samples also contributes to increase the efficiency of PCR.We next tested if using a higher volume of PK+HID samples could improve SARS-CoV-2 detection in the RT-qPCR determinations. Although the sensitivity of the assay is expected to be higher with more copies of the viral RNA template, a previous report also suggested that increasing too much this volume may have the opposite effect due to RT-qPCR inhibitors in the sample matrix [17] . We observed that the amplification curves shifted to lower cycles when using instead of -qPCR determination resulting in lower CT values for the N1 region (0.3 to 1 units, S2 Table) . This result suggests that a higher sample volume could contribute to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in samples with low viral titers.Finally, we tested if the performance of the PK+HID method depends on PK concentration in the range of 0.1 to 1 mg/ml. Fig 1d shows that CT values obtained for the viral and human amplicons did not change within this PK concentration range. These values were also lower than those observed in the absence of PK, confirming the improving role of PK in this extraction-free method.All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.We next ran RT-qPCR determinations of SARS-CoV-2 in PK+HID and purified RNA samples prepared from positive and negative nasopharyngeal swab samples. Based on the results showed in the previous section, we used 1 mg/ml PK for the PK-(i.e.between the volumes assayed in the previous section) in the following RT-qPCR assays. For this particular experiment, we only analyzed the N1 viral gene and the RP human internal control to maximize the number of samples loaded in the PCR multiwell plate.In these experiments, we correctly identified all positive (27/27) and negative (6/6) samples. Fig 2   also shows that the CT values determined for the viral sequence N1 in PK+HID positive samples strongly correlated with those values measured in purified RNA samples supporting that the PK+HID treatment robustly preserves the information on the viral loads in the swab specimens. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.In the previous sections, we showed that the PK+HID method resulted in an efficient alternative to bypass RNA extraction when detecting the N1 and N2 regions of the viral RNA. However, most laboratories use PCR kits that target other viral genes often combined in multiplex setups.Therefore, we next evaluated if the improved PK+HID method could be used with multiplexing detections kits.The work of Reinius and colleagues [17] confirmed the virus inactivation after HID treatment. As a control, we also run infectivity assays as described in A common practice in many clinical labs involves freezing/thawing reagents several times. Therefore, we tested if repeated cycles of freezing/thawing of the PK stock solution may affect the performance of PK+HID. To address this issue, we processed 10 positive samples by PK+HID using a PK solution that was previously subjected to 10 cycles of freezing/thawing or a PK solution thawed only once. The mean differences in CT values between these samples were 0.17 + 0.15 (N), -0.05 + 0.20 (ORF1ab) and 0.01 + 0.14 (RP) (Ndata = 10) showing that the PK stock solution is stable for up to 10 cycles of freezing/thawing.The analysis of CT values measured in PK+HID and RNA samples showed stronger correlations for the N amplicon in comparison to E and RdRp amplicons (Fig 4a) . Additionally, some of the Npositive RNA samples (also considered SARS-CoV-2 positive in clinical diagnosis [24] ) showed negative results for the E and RdRp amplicons (3/38 and 4/38, respectively); this difference increased in PK+HID samples with 8 more samples showing negative results for both amplicons while being N-positive. As mentioned above, other authors also reported a poor detection and large right-shifts in CT values for E amplicon in extraction-free samples [17] .genes in randomly-selected clinical specimens. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were processed for RNA extraction (purified RNA) or subjected to treatment with PK 1 mg/ml (55 o C for 15 min) followed by heat- We also observed that the amplification efficiency of viral amplicons N, E and RdRp was similar for PK+HID and purified RNA samples whereas EPCR of the internal control RP was slightly lower for PK+HID samples (Fig 4b) . These results support that the PK+HID treatment contributes to inactivate inhibitors of the PCR reaction.In this last validation assay, we also analyzed the amplification curves of positive samples with with this kit. We could detect 29/29 and 5/6 positive and negative samples, respectively suggesting that PK+HID could be combined with these type of detection kits.The gold standard method for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab samples is RT-qPCR, a technique with exquisite sensitivity and high specificity commonly applied to analyze purified RNA samples.The RNA extraction step has nowadays become the bottleneck in COVID-19 testing, especially during pandemic outbreaks when personnel, resources and biosafety compatible facilities to perform the testing are scarce.The fast evolution of COVID-19 pandemic and the necessity of performing massive and rapid RT-qPCR determinations to test, trace and isolate SARS-CoV-2 positive patients encouraged the scientific community to evaluate alternative methods to bypass the laborious RNA extraction step.We mentioned above heat inactivation methods that make use of a fast thermal-treatment of the samples and allow the identification of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples targeting N1 and N2 viral genes [17] . These results are consistent with other works that also tested the performance of heatinactivated respiratory samples in RT-qPCR assays [8, 11, [26] [27] [28] [29] .In line with these reports, our data shows that preincubation with PK improves the performance of the heat-inactivation protocol in RT-qPCR assays targeting N1 and N2 viral genes with the 2019-nCoV CDC Diagnostic Panel. However, a validation with a larger number of samples should be done to compare the sensitivities of both methods. We verified that the performance of the PK+HID does not depend on PK concentration in the range of 0.1 -1 mg/ml; this robustness of the PK+HID method is appealing since small variations in the PK concentration will not significantly affect the results of SARS-CoV-2 determinations and also allows reducing even more the costs of sample preparation for RT-qPCR assays.Using the 2019-nCoV CDC Diagnostic Panel, we could correctly identify the SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative analyzed samples and, for the positive samples, we obtained CT values in PK+HID samples very close to those of purified RNAs (2.7 units for N1) whereas heat inactivation without PK treatment produces higher shifts in CTs (5 units for N1).Remarkably, we demonstrated that the PK+HID method could be used in combination with other RT-qPCR kits that target different viral genes in multiplex RT-qPCR reactions. Specifically, we used DisCoVery (targeting N and ORF1ab genes) and Genefinder (targeting N, E and RdRp genes). The detection of these genes was unexpected since the HID method did not provide satisfactory results in the detection of larger amplicons [17] . We found that CT values of both N and ORF1ab viral amplicons detected with DisCoVery were similar to those measured for the purified RNA samples, in line with our observations with the CDC kit.Although the detection of the E and RdRp genes with the Genefinder kit was weaker than the detection of the N gene, the relatively high detection sensitivity of the PK+HID method estimated from the analysis of 94 randomly selected samples suggests that the PK+HID method can be used as an alternative, extraction-free RT-qPCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swab samples in clinical diagnostics.Plus RealAmp and DisCoVery SARS-CoV-2RT-PCR detection kits. Since the extraction-free protocol may reduce the efficiency of the PCR, it is critical to select a PCR kit that preserves sensitivity. While most bibliography, as well as our own findings point to N as the most sensitive viral region, ORF1ab gene also showed a good performance with our extraction-free protocol.Our results indicate that the combination of proteinase K preincubation with heat inactivation is a very robust and reliable procedure for extraction-free RT-qPCR determinations of SARS-CoV-2. We should mention that preparation of the 94 PK+HID samples required to complete the 96-well PCR plate (2 wells are needed for the positive and negative controls) takes approximately 60 min by one operator whereas manual extraction of the same number of samples using commercial kits would take 5-6 hours of work in a Biosafety Level 2 area with continuous use of a benchtop centrifuge.Additionally, PK treatment involves an estimated cost of 0.37 USD per sample whereas the cost of standard RNA extraction procedures is clearly superior (6-10 USD per sample in Argentina). We should also highlight that the HID method combined with the 2019-nCoV CDC Diagnostic Panel is an inexpensive option since it does not require extra reagents as PK+HID.The simplicity and relatively short period of time required for the protocol and the full-availability and low price of the required reagents place PK+HID as a cheap, simple and fast alternative to traditional RNA extraction protocols.",Argentina,first author,2020-12-17,12

In March of 2020, the World Health Organization and the Global Emergency Committee called for early and fast detection in order to prevent the spread of the virus (Sohrabi et al. 2020) .Whether a person is infected with SARS-CoV-2 or not is an issue that a medical procedure can reveal by the genome (or parts of the genome) of these viruses, through the antigen (virus coat), or through the antibodies produced by the immune system to deal with the infection (Beeching et al. 2020) . Although gene detection is the most complex technique, it is an accurate test because the genes of the virus are totally identified. Therefore, this procedure is currently used to confirm positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 cases. For genetic identification, a swab is needed to get a sample from the nose, mouth and/or lungs, which is placed into a plastic tube containing chemicals preservatives. Afterwards, the sample is extracted and analyzed by means of a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This technique uses various supplies, most of which are single-use plastics (Tang et al. 2020) . In contrast, virus detection by antibodies can detect active infections, but more importantly, it can tell whether a person has been infected in the past, since antibodies can be conserved for a long time after infection. The commercial rapid diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 provides qualitative detection of IgG and/or IgM from human serum, whole blood or plasma in approximately 10-15 minutes; these kits are also mostly made of plastics. The SARS Coronavirus Envelope Protein technique, which is immune reactive with serum from J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof SARS-infected individuals, is the least used due to the fact that antigens can be produced by other viruses, and thus give too many false positive results (Scohy et al. 2020 ).The use of plastic is widespread globally, and medical supplies are not an exception (McKeen 2014) . Plastics have become persistent pollutants across-the-board, generating serious effects on the environment and menacing wildlife (Vegter et al. 2014; Wilcox et al. 2015; Worm et al. 2017) . These microplastics are also being consumed by humans which could result in adverse side effects (Campanale et al. 2020; Cox et al. 2019; Prata et al. 2020a ). Countless international initiatives have been enforced to raise awareness of the effects of plastics, and encourage the use of alternative biodegradable materials (Hermabessiere et al. 2017; Lambert and Wagner 2017; LI et al. 2016; Rujnić-Sokele and Pilipović 2017) . The majority of health facilities use incineration as a way to inactivate pathogens (such as the virus that causes COVID-19) in biohazardous residues (Ghodrat et al. 2017) . Among these wastes are plastics, which when burned release persistent chemical pollutants, such as dioxin and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) (Li et al. 2019; Wisniewski et al. 2020) . These chemical contaminants are highly harmful to humans and environmental health (Andersen et al. 2018; Hylland 2006; Lv et al. 2020; Mandal 2005; Mocarelli et al. 1996) .Researchers are concerned about the possible environmental impacts (positive or negative) that could result as a consequence of the ongoing global pandemic. Medical plastic residues undoubtedly possess a potential for negative impacts (Espejo et al. 2020; Klemeš et al. 2020; Prata et al. 2020b; Saadat et al. 2020; Zambrano-Monserrate et al. 2020) . Quantifying the global impact of medical plastic residues during this pandemic is difficult but necessary.We recognize the need for diagnostic testing SARS-CoV-2 to identify virus hotspots in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof urban and rural areas, as well as the implementation of public health measures that could decrease the virus spreading. Single-use plastics and COVID-19 are currently unavoidable.It is necessary however, to assess the environmental impacts of this pandemic and reduce the use of plastic in medical supplies. Many of which are incalculable (such a Personal Protective Equipment, PPE), as there is no source to quantify them. The plastics generated by the COVID-19 tests can be estimated because the number of tests performed is known and the RT-PCR technique is the standard worldwide. The aim of this approach is to estimate the types and the mass of plastic residues from COVID-19 diagnostic tests, as well as discover where these medical plastic residues commonly end up.Although this article focuses on plastic waste and possible impacts generated by the confirmatory COVID-19 test, we do recognize the important role of this test in detecting COVID-19. This pandemic is a human tragedy, which has already taken the lives of many people. Nevertheless, an analysis of the waste generated in this pandemic can be useful to determine possible negative impacts on health and the environment. Moreover, the information presented here is useful in order to evaluate the short-and long-term alternatives that can mitigate potential negative impacts in the future.Using standard protocols for RNA extraction and SARS-CoV-2 detection by Geneaid Biotech and Thermo Fisher Scientific, all plastic inputs normally used in COVID-19 diagnostic tests (ranging from sample collection to result) were identified in detail. For this purpose, coronavirus disease tests using real-time PCR (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 were J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof considered because this medical technique is widely used throughout the world. During the next step, the plastic supplies used on each diagnostic test were identified, weighed separately using an EJ-610 balance, with a detection limit of 0.01gr. The weights were analyzed in triplicate after which an average was obtained. The results were expressed in grams. With this information, the plastic residues generated by each RT-PCR diagnostic test was estimated. The available cumulative COVID-19 test data and tests performed per confirmed case of COVID-19 were obtained through the official websites of each country or global databases (see Table S1 ) on August 13, 2020. Data on population and gross domestic product (GDP) were obtained from the ""Our World in Data"" (Roser et al. 2020 ).The total weight of plastic residues generated by RT-PCR tests was estimated according to the cumulative COVID-19 tests worldwide, by continent and country levels (total number of tests carried out until August 2020). The plastic residues generated from confirmatory testing for COVID-19 were compared with population and GDP of each country. Furthermore, we identified the mass of medical plastic waste incinerated at global, continent, and country level, as well as the mass of those residues that ended up in landfills.Finally, we indicated environmental and health impacts of the chemical emissions that are produced when medical plastic waste is incinerated.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Worldwide single Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, using disposable plastics in several of its steps were identified (Table 1) . The plastics used are listed below, the procedure for collected samples is made by using a 10 cm plastic swab (2.89 grams), which is inserted into a 5 ml falcon plastic tube (3.31 grams). Once in the laboratory, the sample is transferred into 15 ml falcon plastic tube (6.93 grams) using a micropipette with a 1000 µl plastic tip (0.70 grams), and then the RNA extraction is performed. An automatic RNA extraction was considered, as it generates less plastic residues and is currently used for this purpose. The samples are transferred into commercial plastic vessels (114.5 grams per eight samples) using single-use Pasteur plastic pipettes (1.25 grams). At this stage, reagents are added to Eppendorf plastic tubes (0.98 grams per twenty-four samples) by means of a micropipette using a 200 µl plastic tip (0.25 grams per twenty-four samples).Automatic sample homogenization is performed using 1000 µl plastic tips (0.70 grams).The RNA extraction equipment uses three buffers that come with 1liter disposable plastic bottle (88.7 grams per bottle); each buffer container holds 400 samples. Following the extraction, the sample is placed into Eppendorf plastic tubes (0.98 grams) using a 200 µl tipped plastic micropipette (0.25 grams). The plastic estimation for PCR reaction was based on TaqMan™ 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v1 (Applied Biosystems). A master-mix is performed in a 1.5 ml screw-capped microcentrifuge plastic tube (0.98 grams), in which the Master Mix (4X), the 2019-nCoV assay (20X), the RNAse P assay (20X) 1.25 and the RT-PCR grade water all well mixed. Each master-mix in a 1.5 ml screw-capped microcentrifuge plastic tube is just for 40 samples. The master mix has several formats, but the biggest is a 10mL bottle that allows 16,000 reactions. A plastic cryovial (2.22 grams) containing the other reagents for just 50 reactions of 25uL each. Aerosol plastic barrier tips are used per each transfer of samples (2.49 grams per tip). Finally, to read the samples, these are placed J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f into a 96-well PCR plastic plate (23.6 grams) and covered with MicroAmp™ Optical Adhesive Film (7 grams); it must be considered that each plate includes positive and negative controls, thus 40 tests are made per plate. Therefore, each RT-PCR diagnostic test for COVID-19 uses 37.27 grams of disposable plastics.The mass of global plastic residues from RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 are indicated in Table S1 . According to the information available, we estimated that a mass of 15,439.59 tons of plastic residues have been generated worldwide as a consequence of using the RT-PCR diagnostic tests until August 2020. By continent (Figure 3 ), the plastic waste generated by RT-PCR diagnostic test are the following in decreasing order; Asia (62.29%), North America (16.65%), Europe (14.28%), South America (3.65%), Africa (1.81%) and Oceania (1.33%). The ten countries with the most plastic residues are: China (38.62%), United States (15.38%), Russia (7.40%), India (6.48%), United Kingdom (3.33%), Germany (1.93%), Italy (1.67%), Spain (1.61%), United Arab Emirates (1.38%) and Turkey (1.27%). Of all the countries recorded in Figure 1 , these 10 countries represent 79.07% of all plastic residues generated with RT-PCR tests for coronavirus.Unlike other plastic residues (e.g., domestic garbage), medical plastic residues derived from COVID-19 tests have no correlation to population size nor to a country´s gross domestic product. There is also no relationship between the plastic residues from COVID-19 tests and confirmed cases for coronavirus. This lack of correlation is because most COVID-19tests carried out depend more on political decisions of health authorities of each country.Of all the plastics used in confirmatory testing for 89.99% (33.54 grams) correspond to polypropylene, 8.22% (3.06 grams) to polyester, and 1.78% (0.66 grams) to polyethylene.Currently, management of the final disposal of plastic waste generated by the RT-PCR test for COVID-19 worldwide depends principally on whether it is biohazardous waste, biological samples possibly exposed to COVD-19, or non-biohazardous waste which correspond mainly to plastic residues that have been in contact with reagents and not directly with biological samples. Biohazardous plastic residues are commonly incinerated, representing about 97% of the total plastic residues. These plastic residues correspond to 91.50% (33.01 grams) of polypropylene, 8.49% (3.06 grams) to polyester, and 0.01% to polyethylene. In contrasts, 3.20% of the total plastic residues are classified as nonbiohazardous plastic residues, which commonly end up in landfill; these residues correspond to 55.69% (0.66 grams) of polyethylene, 44.30% (0.05 grams) of polypropylene, and 0.01% of polyester.According to data indicated in Table 1 (incineration or landfill) and data from Table S1 (sum of the tests performed in each country), we calculated that at the global level more than 14,900 tons of COVID-19 test plastic residues have been incinerated, whereas only 494 tons of the plastic waste have ended up in landfills. Most countries have more than 10 tons of plastic waste that is incinerated (see Figure 2 and Table S2 ). It was estimated that the 99.2% of the global COVID-19 test plastic residues incinerated are composed of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f polypropylene. The estimated percentage was calculated taking data from Table 1 and   Table S1 .Non-biohazardous plastic residues usually go to landfills, but once there they might be exposed to wild animals, such as birds that could eat plastic fragments. With adequate control systems, these plastics should not cause negative impacts on the environment and health, even beyond the years it takes to degrade them. Non-biohazardous plastic residues usually go to landfills, but once there they might be exposed to wild species, such as birds, which could eat plastic fragments.Bio-hazardous plastics can produce extremely toxic chemical pollutants when burned (Mandal 2005) . In the 1980s, the incineration of plastic waste itself generated gases that were dangerous to human health, especially when different types of hospital waste were burned (Allen et al. 1986 ). Incineration process techniques to control emissions of toxic gases into the atmosphere from the burning of plastics and other waste have been modernized (Tait et al. 2020) . These advanced technologies for gas control generated by incineration processes are currently used in developed countries such as USA and in the European Union, thus the emissions of toxic chemical compounds are significantly reduced. On the other hand, less developed countries are still using old incineration technologies and thus emitting toxic chemicals to the air (Tait et al. 2020 ). In any case, any incineration of plastic chemicals when burned emits some chemicals to a lesser or greater extent (Tait et al. 2020; Walker and Cooper 1992) .Toxic gas emissions generated by the incineration process for plastic residues with COVID-19 tests are likely to be lower than those generated by other emissions sources. It is difficult to measure the gas emissions generated by the incineration process for COVID-19 plastic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f residues, since their burning is usually done along with other associated wastes.Furthermore, these emissions can vary among gas control techniques implemented in various geographical location around the world. During this pandemic, it is troublesome to assess burned COVID-19 waste emissions while numerous locations are still in lockdown, and with increased restrictions to areas that are likely to have higher volumes of contagious waste.However, many of these chemicals emitted such as dioxins, PAHs and other persistent organic compounds are chemicals that have no biological threshold. Their mere presence can cause biological alterations and their emissions should not be underestimated (Newman 2009 ). Furthermore, in the atmosphere this fraction of pollutants generated by the incineration of COVID-19 tests (which can be the lowest when modern gas emission controls are used) is mixed with other air pollutants from different sources, increasing the levels of atmospheric contaminants and producing a synergistic effect that may result in severe biological effects. These chemicals emitted by the incineration of plastics can enter living organisms leading to serious environmental and health effects (Li et al. 2019 ). Health effects may include disruption of normal hormone signaling pathways, reproductive and developmental defects, immunotoxicity, liver damage, wasting syndrome, and cancer (Kogevinas 2001; Mandal 2005; Yoshida et al. 2000) . Furthermore, pollutants such as dioxins last a long time because of their chemical stability and their ability to be absorbed by fat tissue (WHO 2010). Air pollution has been described as an influential factor in the increase of cases of COVID-19. Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) obstructs the respiratory tract, and the chemicals that make up these particles (such as dioxins and PAHs) have a role in promoting viral J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f diseases by sharing the same mechanisms of action in the immune system. These can affect COVID-19 as well as other viral respiratory diseases (Espejo et al. 2020) . The burning of biohazardous materials derived from COVID-19 tests can influence the susceptibility of diseases.The lockdown in many cities caused the collapse of the oil price thus lowering the costs of oil products such as plastics. As a result, they are cheaper to manufacture than to recycle (Adyel 2020) . Plastic waste has increased during the pandemic, especially when one looks at hospital and household residues (Espejo et al. 2020) . The increase in plastic waste has attracted considerable concern from scientists and policy makers (Klemeš et al. 2020; Silva et al. 2020) . Scientific articles that highlight the problem of environmental impact that could be generated by the increased use of plastics in various sectors in the pandemic (Espejo et al. 2020; Silva et al. 2020 ).In the first days of the coronavirus pandemic in Wuhan (China), more than 200 tons of medical residues from hospitals were reported daily, i.e. four times the usual amount (Saadat et al. 2020 ). On March 21st, 2020, China's national medical waste treatment daily capacity increased from 4,8092.8 tons to 6,066.8 tons. In Wuhan, it varied from 50 tons before the pandemic to 265.6 tons (Chen and Guo, 2020) . The average value of medical waste in Dhaka, Bangladesh added up to 206 tons per day during the pandemic (Rahman et al. 2020) . Medical waste found in Indonesia (Jakarta) reached about 12,740 tons, approximately 60 days after people in the area were first infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Sangkham 2020) . The North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) also observed an additional 11.4 tons of hazardous waste generated by households (Abhimanyu 2020). TheApollo Hospital in Ahmedabad reported a fatality rate that increased 1.5 times compared to the normal daily rate. (Yahoo 2020) . The Catalan Agency for Waste Management of Spain reported 350% increase of medical waste, implying an increase of 925 tons per month over the usual records (ACR 2020). During the eight-week lockdown in Singapore, packaged takeaway plastics added an additional 1,400 tons of plastic waste (Bengali 2020) .Although the aim of this study was to evaluate the plastics generated by the COVID-19 confirmatory test (Prata et al. 2020b) , one should bear in mind that PPE have also increased, although in the latter is more complicated to evaluate their contribution to the increase in plastic waste, since many of these products, such as masks, are made from a mixture of vegetable and synthetic fibers (Fadare and Okoffo 2020) . It is estimated that over 129 billion masks and 65 billion gloves have been used worldwide each month (Prata et al. 2020b) . 116 million single-use masks were marketed on a single day in February in China, about 12 times the usual amount (Bermingham and Tan 2020) . Incorrect disposal of only 1% of the masks exceeds 10 million items, weighing 30,000 to 40,000 kg (Adyel 2020 ). In the United States is reported that the PPEs has multiplied growth (Justine 2020) and medical waste has grown by up to 370% and the demand for packaging plastics by up to 40% (Silva et al. 2021 ).It is difficult to estimate the medical plastic residues generated by other diagnostic techniques (e.g., antigen or antibody), since there is no official data on the number of tests performed, whether positive or negative. In addition, there are many other medical supplies linked to COVID-19 diagnostic centers that also use disposable plastics, such as gloves, biosafety gowns, sleeves, masks, shoe covers, biohazard bag caps, among others. Hospital plastic residues from medical examinations and treatments could increases the mass of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f plastic residues. The current amount of medical plastic residue and its impact is still difficult to estimate, but we project that it will be worrisome if the coronavirus pandemic persists for months or even years. Although PPE are usually made of plastic and weigh more than the test itself, their use is not standardized and depends on socio-cultural variables of each country, which makes it difficult to estimate the plastic waste generated globally. Disposable plastics generated with COVID-19 tests are easily estimated because the numbers of tests performed periodically by each country must be reported, and also the technique of the confirmatory test by RT-PCR is largely standardized.In the present study it was estimated that until August 2020 around 15,000 tons of plastic waste have been generated worldwide by COVID-19 test (total number of tests carried out up to August 2020). It is difficult to make a projection of how much plastic waste will be generated by RT-PCR diagnostic tests carried out at the end of the pandemic, because these do not follow a known pattern and depend largely on the political decisions of the Ministries of Health of each country. Countries have different relationships between test performed and the confirmed case of COVID-19 (See Table S1 ). While some countries continue to increase the number of tests performed daily despite a decreasing number of confirmed cases, other countries have acted otherwise (Roser et al. 2020) . The plastic residues generated by the COVID-19 confirmatory tests correspond to only a part of the hospital plastic residues generated in a pandemic. In many countries the management of medical waste is regulated, however its management is not exempt from negative environmental impacts.The generation of plastic residues is nonetheless inevitable because most diagnostic tests are essential for an early detection of SARS-CoV-2, and to prevent spreading the virus.Real-time PCR and RDT tests are routinely used for detecting a large number of other human and veterinary diseases. It is time to recognize that these diagnostic tests must be environmentally friendly, and there are some short-and long-term actions that should be implemented to reduce the negative impacts of plastic residues from COVID-19 tests.To reduce the negative impacts generated by non-biohazard plastic waste in the short-term, some practical measures can be taken to reduce the amount of packaging containing reagents to be used in PCR assays, before they end up in a landfill. Considering the huge number of samples analyzed, this may be effectively done by acquiring all reagents in larger containers. In addition, nucleotide extraction and PCR reading (both procedures that are time consuming and labor intensive) may be automatized, which can help to reduce plastic waste.Regarding bio-hazardous plastic waste, the incineration process remains the most costeffective technique to kill pathogens. Thus, reducing the negative impacts generated by combustion necessarily must include better gas emission control capable of capturing 99.9% of chemical pollutants. High efficiency incineration used in cement plants, for instance, is capable of significantly reducing dioxin emissions (Richards and Agranovski 2017) , constituting a good option for reducing toxic emissions generated by burning plastics. Nevertheless, it is necessary to consider that this option may require long-distance transport of bio-hazardous materials in most countries, as cement plants are located on suburban areas of the cities, increasing the potential risk of spreading pathogens. Those countries that have waste-to-energy incinerators dedicated to plastics should prioritize this type of incineration for hospital plastic residues.Long-term actions to reduce the environmental impacts of medical waste used with COVID-19 testing, must include the manufacture of biodegradable medical inputs free major compounds in smoke from burning plastics. Therefore, their decomposition would be faster in the case of inputs ended up in landfills, where they would not emit persistent toxic chemicals if they are incinerated. Bioplastics are the most promising possible alternative materials to solve plastic contamination (Shen et al. 2020 ). One such bioplastic initiative suggests the use of polylactic acid (PLA), starch, and protein for making biodegradable polymers (Scheer 2007) . A U.S. Patent indicates the possibility of using high-quality biodegradable resins that have the ability to be sterilized just before medical supplies are manufactured (Kulshrestha et al. 2012) . Bioplastics still have some difficulties because some bacteria only have the ability to degrade specific polymers and not all types of bioplastics, since degradation depends largely on the morphology and physical characteristics of the polymers. Furthermore, in many cases this biological degradation must be supported by UV degradation or hydrolysis processes. Therefore, composting centers must be built and their use disseminated throughout the world (Luyt and Malik 2019) .The manufacture of plastic-alterative medical products is more complicated than the substitution of plastic in other economic sectors. Alternative materials used with diagnostic tests for virus infection should be easily sterilized (resistant to high temperatures), not interfere with the analysis, and must be incinerated without environmental risk. They should also be produced at low cost, as they are needed in massive quantities and are vital in medicine. Possible alternatives in financing for these biomaterials with social and health impacts should be explored. Reductions in taxes on these products and even partial or total J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f subsidies should be considered to more efficiently combat the pandemic and the adverse environmental effects. Incentives in R&D for the specific development of low or no toxicity compounds that support the diagnosis and fight against the current and possible future pandemics must go hand in hand.It is important to analyze the negative environmental impacts of this pandemic caused by medical plastic residues. Furthermore, it is relevant to highlight the urgency of manufacturing sustainable diagnostic tests and PPEs, thus making medicine environmentally friendly. Poor control measures during the incineration process in less developed countries, of these plastic residues can emit toxic pollutants into the atmosphere, which in addition to other pollutant sources can be harmful to human health and the environment. The synergistic mixture of these pollutants can exacerbate disease patterns.Consequently, it is crucial in the short-term to promote better measures to control gas emissions during the incineration process, particularly in countries with poor control measures. On behalf of a sustainable medicine, it is required to drive toward the manufacture of medical tests (and other supplies) able to produce residues that can be incinerated without entailing a risk to human health.The new coronavirus COVID-19 that was officially identified in December 2019, has increased the use of diagnostic tests during the pandemic, which contain medical inputs that are mostly made of plastic. Confirmatory testing for COVID-19 have generated more than 15,000 tons of residues. Most of plastics are made from polypropylene, a type of plastic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f that is frequently used in different medical applications. Considering that medical plastic residues are classified as biohazardous materials, their fate is mainly done through incineration. There is a risk associated to plastic residues incineration under poor control measures, considering that low-income countries are still using old incineration technologies and thus emitting toxic chemicals to the air, resulting harmful to human health and the environment. The sum of these pollutants can exacerbate disease patterns. In the short-term, it is crucial to enforce better measures to reduce gas emissions during the incineration process, especially in those countries where methods of handling, treatment, and disposal of waste are poor. In the interest of a sustainable medicine, it is necessary to promote medical test manufacturing capable of producing residues that can be incinerated without entailing a risk to human health.W.

cd911dd953e4756d724fee2f40192d9086566038,"Sleep During ""Lockdown"" in the COVID-19 Pandemic","The first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, was reported in Wuhan, China on 31st of December 2019 [1, 2] . The virus had spread rapidly, mostly within China, but also to other countries, including in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region [3] . The first three detected European cases were reported in France on 24th of January 2020 and the first death was reported on 15th of February 2020, also in France [4] . As of the 21st of February, nine countries had reported cases: Belgium (1), Finland (1), France (12) , Germany (16) , Italy (3), Russia (2) , Spain (2) , Sweden (1), and the UK (9) . The COVID-19 outbreak officially reached South America later. The coronavirus arrived in Brazil by plane by people from Europe and the first case was reported on February 26th and the first death was announced on March 17th in São Paulo state [5] . As new confirmed cases continued to increase worldwide, governments responded to COVID-19 using interventions that have imposed different degrees of restriction (""lockdown"") on the public, schools, and workplaces.During an epidemic, people experience sudden and major changes in their daytime routines. They go through isolation, stress, insecurity about their health, worries about the situation and its duration, and anxiety regarding future job continuity and financial security [6] . Instead, limited working schedules may also mean that family members spend much more time together than usual or communicate more with friends through social networks. People can better organize their outdoor activities in order to be more exposed to daylight and get more exercise than normal. They can also develop sleep and work hours more closely aligned to their endogenous day and night rhythm, particularly evening types and adolescents [7, 8] .This complicated situation is likely to affect sleep characteristics in terms of quantity and quality. Previous studies during this viral outbreak have not used specific sleep questionnaires and have mostly evaluated medical staff or those who have actually been exposed to or suffered from the virus itself, with a typical quarantine period of 14 days [9] [10] [11] . Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep, in both the general population and health professionals, across several European countries (Greece, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and France) and a South American country (Brazil).Our study was conducted between 25th of March and 6th of April 2020 in Greece, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and France and between 10th and 14th June 2020 in Brazil, periods with similar restriction measures among these countries. The ethical committee of the ""Alexandra"" University Hospital, in Athens, Greece, approved the study protocol (Number of approval: 232/3 April 2020). We conducted a web-based, cross-sectional survey in order to prevent the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through droplets or contact. All people using social tools could see this survey and answer the questionnaire by clicking the relevant link [12] .Interested participants were interviewed by an ad hoc, simple, and anonymous questionnaire of our own development, which included 13 easy to answer questions, as follows: (1) Sex (male, female), (2) Age, (3) Place of residence, (4) Level of education (basic, upper secondary, higher-degree), (5) Current professional status (work outside home, limited work outside home, work at home, health professional, retirement), (6) Abidance in lockdown measures excluding work (yes, sometimes, no), (7) Mean hours of sleep per night during the last week (during lockdown), (8) Mean hours of sleep per night under normal conditions, (9) Qualitative characterization of sleep the last week (during lockdown) (good, moderate, bad), (10) Qualitative characterization of sleep the last week (during lockdown), when compared with sleep in normal conditions (same, better, worst), (11) Naps during the day in order to face the current situation (often, sometimes, never), (12) Need for hypnotic drugs or other substances in order to sleep (often, sometimes, never), and (13) illness or close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 (yes, no). The questionnaire was available in 4 languages-Greek, Portuguese, German, and French.A total number of 2093 subjects completed the questionnaire. We excluded those who did not report duration of sleep during the lockdown week, resulting in a final sample of 1908 participants (Greek, n = 1271; German, n = 257, French, n = 48; Portuguese, n = 332), i.e., 1314 females (68.9%) and 594 males (31.1%), who were considered for further analysis. The mean age of the population was 42.6 ± 12.7 years old. Further, 286 subjects were health professionals (15.2%) . Almost all were obedient in lockdown measures (91.7% yes, 6.1% sometimes), with only 2.2% of the participants reporting no obedience. COVID-19 infection or close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported by 11.2% of the total population: i.e., 1.7% in Greece, 21.6% in German speaking countries: Switzerland/Austria/Germany, 38.8% in France, and 29.2% in Brazil. This was statistically more often reported by health professionals (23.1%) than the general population (p < 0.001).Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism v. 7.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and IBM SPSS v.23.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0. Armonk, NY, USA: IBM Corp.). The statistical analysis included summarization of the data in tables and charts. Descriptive statistics procedures for complex survey data were used to examine demographic and sleep characteristics for all participants. The association among variables was examined by chi-square and the magnitude of these associations was tested by Cramér's phi. A between-within analysis of variance examined the main effects of variables and their interaction on sleep duration and eta square tested the magnitude of these relationships. Pairwise t-tests and Cohen's d also examined the effect of variables on sleep duration and their magnitude, respectively. A p-value less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.A main effect of lockdown week on sleep duration was observed (p < 0.001, η 2 = 0.022) with the sleep duration of the lockdown week being longer than that under normal conditions (Figure 1 ). Sleep duration increased from 7.27 ± 1.21 h per day under normal conditions to 7.52 ± 1.62 h during the lockdown week (p < 0.001). The percentage of participants sleeping 7-8 h per day decreased from 66.1% previously to 48.6% in the lockdown week, whereas the percentage of those sleeping >8 h increased from 11.1% to 28.0%, respectively. The percentage of those sleeping <7 h was identical, 23.4% and 22.9%, respectively ( Figure 1 ). 42.6 ± 12.7 years old. Further, 286 subjects were health professionals (15.2%).

The percentage of participants sleeping 7-8 h per day decreased from 66.1% previously to 48.6% in the lockdown week, whereas the percentage of those sleeping >8 h increased from 11.1% to 28.0%, respectively. The percentage of those sleeping <7 h was identical, 23.4% and 22.9%, respectively ( Figure 1 ). A main effect of education level on lockdown (p = 0.010, η 2 = 0.007) and previous sleep duration (p < 0.001, η 2 = 0.012) was also found, with the highest score in the primary education level. An education*time interaction on sleep duration was observed (p < 0.001, η 2 = 0.013). The sleep duration increased in secondary education by 0.28 ± 1.82 h (95% CI 0.12, 0.45; p = 0.001) and in tertiary education by 0.32 ± 1.53 h (95% CI 0.23, 0.41; p < 0.001), while it decreased in primary education (−0.25 Half of the population (47.1%) characterized their sleep during the lockdown week as good, 37.9% as average, and 15% as bad. In addition, one to two of the participants (49.5%) described the quality of sleep as the same, 19.2% as better, and 31.3% as worse than that under normal conditions. Need for hypnotic drugs or other substances in order to sleep was often 3.4%, occasionally 6.3%, and never 90.2%. Finally, taking naps during the day in order to face the current situation was often 11.9%, occasionally 36.7%, and never 51.4% of the total population. Data of the population are summarized in Table 1 . Half of the population (47.1%) characterized their sleep during the lockdown week as good, 37.9% as average, and 15% as bad. In addition, one to two of the participants (49.5%) described the quality of sleep as the same, 19.2% as better, and 31.3% as worse than that under normal conditions.

Finally, taking naps during the day in order to face the current situation was often 11.9%, occasionally 36.7%, and never 51.4% of the total population. Data of the population are summarized in Table 1 . Participants who reported good quality of sleep during lockdown were older than those with average and bad quality of sleep (age 44.4 ± 12.7, 41.4 ± 12.5 and 40.3 ± 12.4 years, respectively; p < 0.001, η 2 = 0.017). Education level was associated with both quality of sleep in lockdown (χ 2 = 26.690, p < 0.001, ϕ = 0.118) and change in quality of sleep in lockdown compared to a normal week (χ 2 = 20.146, p = 0.003, ϕ = 0.115) ( Table 2 ). For instance, participants with tertiary level education had better quality of sleep in lockdown compared to those with a lower education level. In addition, participants with a tertiary level education reported better quality of sleep in lockdown compared to a normal week to a larger extent than those with a lower education level. With regards to the relationship between quality and duration of sleep, participants with good quality of sleep in lockdown had a longer duration of sleep in lockdown (8.0 ± 1.3 h) than those with average (7.3 ± 1.5 h) and bad quality of sleep (6.4 ± 1.9 h; p < 0.001, η 2 = 0.125). Change in sleep duration in lockdown compared to normal was 0.75 ± 1.27 h, 0.11 ± 1.55 h and −1.02 ± 2.07 h in participants with good, average, and bad quality of sleep in lockdown, respectively (p < 0.001, η 2 = 0.137). However, these three groups of quality of sleep in lockdown did not differ in terms of sleep duration in a normal week (p = 0.106, η 2 = 0.002).A main effect of age group on lockdown sleep duration was observed (p < 0.001, η 2 = 0.017), with the longest in the <25 years age group and the shortest in the 45-54 years group (Figure 2) . A main effect of age group on previous sleep duration was also shown (p < 0.001, η 2 = 0.016), with the longest in the >64 group and the shortest in the 45-54 group. No age group*time interaction on sleep duration was found (p = 0.078, η 2 = 0.005), with the largest change in the <25 group (+0.55 h) and the smallest in the >64 group (−0.03 h). Age correlated with lockdown sleep duration (r = −0.093, p < 0.001), change in sleep duration (r = −0.063, p = 0.006), but not with previous sleep duration (r = −0.038, p = 0.095).No sex difference was observed in sleep duration in the lockdown week (mean difference +0.14 h, 95% CI −0.01, 0.30; p = 0.075), whereas women had longer sleeps than men in previous weeks (+0.15 h, 95% CI 0.03, 0.26; p = 0.014). No sex*time interaction on sleep duration was shown (p = 0.956, η 2 < 0.001). Sex was associated with compliance with self-restraint measures (χ 2 = 6.218, p = 0.045, ϕ = 0.062), group of lockdown sleep duration (χ 2 = 29.839, p < 0.001, ϕ = 0.136), group of previous sleep duration (χ 2 = 11.180, p = 0.004, ϕ = 0.084), quality of sleep (χ 2 = 42.325, p < 0.001, ϕ = 0.162), change of sleep quality (χ 2 = 47.767, p < 0.001, ϕ = 0.175), naps (χ 2 = 7.856, p = 0.020, ϕ = 0.070), and medication (χ 2 = 11.697, p = 0.003, ϕ = 0.085). No sex association was shown with the occurrence of a COVID event in peers (χ 2 = 0.083, p = 0.773, ϕ = −0.007). Compared to men, more women reported compliance with self-restraint measures, had less sleep duration of 7-8 h, bad sleep, decreased quality of sleep for the lockdown week when compared with the previous one, less naps, and higher use of medication.Considering two occupation groups (health professionals versus others), a week*occupation interaction on sleep duration was shown (p < 0.001, η 2 = 0.012) (Figure 3) . A pair-wise t-test showed that sleep duration increased in the lockdown week in other occupations by 0.31 ± 1.62 h (95% confidence intervals, CI, 0.24, 0.39; p < 0.001), whereas it remained stable in health professionals (−0.18 ± 1.60 h; 95% CI −0.36, 0.01; p = 0.063). Considering all occupation groups, a main effect of occupation on lockdown sleep duration was found (p < 0.001, η 2 = 0.035), with the shortest in health professionals and the longest in unemployed people. Also, a main effect of occupation on previous sleep duration was observed (p < 0.001, η 2 = 0.022), with the shortest in health professionals (6.94 ± 1.50 h) and the longest in retired people (7.84 ± 1.87 h) and those working at home (7.86 ± 1.60 h). A week*occupation interaction on sleep duration was shown (p = 0.012, η 2 = 0.017), with the largest increase in those working at home (+0.48 ± 1.68 h) and the smallest in those working part-time out of home (+0.34 ± 1.62 h). Considering two occupation groups (health professionals versus others), a week*occupation interaction on sleep duration was shown (p < 0.001, η 2 = 0.012) (Figure 3) . A pair-wise t-test showed that sleep duration increased in the lockdown week in other occupations by 0.31 ± 1.62 h (95% confidence intervals, CI, 0.24, 0.39; p < 0.001), whereas it remained stable in health professionals (−0.18 ± 1.60 h; 95% CI −0.36, 0.01; p = 0.063). Considering all occupation groups, a main effect of occupation on lockdown sleep duration was found (p < 0.001, η 2 = 0.035), with the shortest in health professionals and the longest in unemployed people. Also, a main effect of occupation on previous sleep duration was observed (p < 0.001, η 2 = 0.022), with the shortest in health professionals (6.94 ± 1.50 h) and the longest in retired people (7.84 ± 1.87 h) and those working at home (7.86 ± 1.60 h). A week*occupation interaction on sleep duration was shown (p = 0.012, η 2 = 0.017), with the largest increase in those working at home (+0.48 ± 1.68 h) and the smallest in those working part-time out of home (+0.34 ± 1.62 h). Occupation was associated with group of lockdown sleep duration (χ 2 = 35.597, p < 0.001, ϕ = 0.150), quality of sleep (χ 2 = 15.594, p < 0.001, ϕ = 0.100), change of sleep quality (χ 2 = 6.676, p = 0.035, ϕ = 0.066), and occurrence of a COVID event in peers (χ 2 = 12.961, p < 0.001, ϕ = 0.091). No occupation association was shown with compliance with self-restraint measures (χ 2 = 2.937, p = 0.230, ϕ = 0.043), group of previous sleep duration (χ 2 = 5.531, p = 0.063, ϕ = 0.060), naps (χ 2 = 2.585, p = 0.275, ϕ = 0.041), and medication (χ 2 = 1.480, p = 0.477, ϕ = 0.031). Compared to other occupations, health professionals had less sleep duration of 7-8 h, less good quality sleep, decreased quality of sleep, and higher occurrence of COVID in peers.A country*time interaction on sleep duration (p < 0.001, η 2 = 0.036) was observed, with Greece showing the largest increase. Sleep duration increased in Greece by 0.45 ± 1.75 h (95% CI 0.35, 0.54; p < 0.001) and Switzerland/Austria/Germany by 0.10 ± 0.73 h (95% CI 0.01, 0.19; p = 0.029), did not change in France (−0.05 ± 0.99 h; 95% CI −0.34, 0.24; p = 0.719), and decreased in Brazil (−0.36 ± 1.60 h; 95% CI −0.53, −0.19; p < 0.001). Country was also associated with compliance with self-restraint measures (χ 2 = 96.662, p < 0.001, ϕ = 0.223), group of lockdown sleep duration (χ 2 = 52.412, p < 0.001, ϕ = 0.180), group of previous sleep duration (χ 2 = 18.854, p < 0.001, ϕ = 0.109), quality of sleep (χ 2 = 71.840, p < 0.001, ϕ = 0.194), change of sleep quality (χ 2 = 91.796, p < 0.001, ϕ = 0.243), naps (χ 2 = 9.642, p = 0.047, ϕ = 0.078), and occurrence of a COVID event in peers (χ 2 = 309.441, p < 0.001, ϕ = 0.405). No country association was shown with medication (χ 2 = 0.914, p = 0.923, ϕ = 0.024). Compared to other countries, Greece had higher compliance with self-restraint measures, less lockdown sleep duration of 7-8 h, better quality of sleep, larger change in quality of sleep, more naps, and less occurrence of COVID in peers.According to our study, the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown impacted on sleep in different ways depending on age, level of education, occupation, and country of residence. Regarding quality, half of the population described their sleep as bad or average and one third of the participants reported worse sleep during the lockdown week than in a normal one. However, self-reported sleep duration increased in the general population, but not in health professionals. Individuals who preserved a good quality of sleep also slept more when compared to those with average and bad quality of sleep during the lockdown week, but not in a normal week. To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated possible associations between lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic and sleep characteristics, both in the general population and in health professionals, in several European countries and in Brazil.The COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019 and relevant mass home confinement led to a unique and stressful situation for many all around the globe. Lockdown separates persons potentially exposed to an infectious agent (and thus, at risk for disease) by restricting access to the general community. It has periodically been used for centuries to control the spread of infectious diseases, like cholera or plague, with some success [13, 14] . It has always been associated with fear, threat, misunderstanding, and economic difficulties. A previous study during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the early 2000s showed that persons placed in quarantine expressed anxiety, depression, stress, and posttraumatic stress disorder [15] . In the current COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, another study showed that medical staff had increased levels of anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy, which were dependent on sleep quality and social support [11] .Although after a good night of sleep, one's brain and body feels refreshed and restored to normal function, no study has focused specifically on sleep in the general population during the COVID pandemic and lockdown. Work time, family time, and time for socializing, relaxing, and leisure are the primary activities reciprocally related to sleep time. According to our data, a sleep ""gain"" existed during the current situation in a part of our population, possibly due to less activities. Adequate sleep is a key indicator of cardio-metabolic health. We hypothesize that this sleep ""gain"" could-at least partially-explain the observed decline of acute cardiovascular events. On the other hand, one third of our participants reported worse sleep quality when compared to that of a normal week and half of the population described their sleep quality as bad or average during the pandemic. Poor sleep quality has a major long term impact on mental and physical health and strongly correlates with depression and anxiety [16] . With regards to the relationship between quality and duration of sleep, participants with good quality of sleep in lockdown also had a longer duration of sleep in lockdown than those with average or bad quality of sleep. However, these three groups of quality of sleep in lockdown did not differ in terms of sleep duration in a normal week.Sleep time was shown to be longer in young adults <25 years and shorter in the 45-54 years group. Young adults usually extend sleep duration during weekends as a recovery of sleep restriction during weekdays [7] . Also, sleep time reaches its minimum at age 45-54 years, when work time reaches its maximum [7] . The largest increase was observed in those working at home and the smallest in health professionals. According to previous data, each additional hour of work costs 7 to 10 min of sleep [17] and people working more than 50 h/week-e.g., health professionals-are more likely to be short sleepers and less likely to be long sleepers compared to people who work <35 h/week [18] . Furthermore, medical staff can suffer from insomnia during pandemics because of worries about being infected, uncertainty regarding effective disease control, and work isolation [19] .Sleep duration also increased in people with secondary and tertiary education, but not in those with primary and other education, in accordance with previously published data [19] . Moreover, a higher education level was associated with better quality of sleep when compared to other levels of education. A lower level of education is usually associated with a lower socioeconomic status and increased fear and anxiety about job continuity and financial security [19] .Finally, the observation that sleep increased more in Greece than in other countries may reflect the different ways of living and socializing in different countries of Europe; e.g., outdoor activities with family and/or friends are more common when the weather is warm and the sun is shining. In contrast to what was observed in Greece, in Brazil, the amount of sleeping hours decreased. There are several differences between countries that may be associated with this difference in sleeping hours' behavior. The lower socioeconomic status of the Brazilians may increase the fear about their economic situation, which can increase concern about the economic situation compromising quality and quantity of sleep. Moreover, the Brazilian Ministry of Health recommended quarantine measures to avoid the coronavirus spread for the whole country, however a lot of people (including the Brazilian President, Jair Bolsonaro) denied the evidence about the severity of the disease [5, 20] . The opposing recommendations from the Brazilian Ministry of Health and the country's President increased the population's feeling of insecurity, fear, and anxiety, which may also compromise the population's sleep. In addition, Brazil has one of the highest transmission rates of the virus in the world [21] and together with EUA, one of the highest number of cases and deaths around the world [22] , a fact that can increase the population's concern about their health and be harmful for their sleeping hours.No difference in absolute sleep length was observed between men and women before and during the ""lockdown"" week. However, fewer women than men slept 7-8 h, whereas more women than men reported bad sleep, decreased quality of sleep the last week when compared with the previous one, less naps, and higher use of medication. It is well documented that sleep in women differs in many aspects from that of men, mainly attributed to hormonal factors [23] . During their lifespan, women pass through different hormonal statuses-menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause-with unique features of sleep disruption. In general, women appear to report a greater need for sleep and more subjective complaints of non-refreshing or insufficient sleep than men [23] . Also, insomnia is approximately 1.5 times more common in women than in men [24] .Our study has several limitations. First, our survey was based on a rapid, self-reported questionnaire to assess sleep characteristics. Subjective reports could not be verified with objective measurements, e.g., with actigraphy, due to quarantine and relevant mass home confinement. Also, the questionnaire was self-designed and not previously validated. No standard questionnaire exists for the investigation of sleep characteristics during a contagion outbreak. Finally, our population was not very well stratified. Participants were volunteers who responded through a web-based questionnaire and their distribution by country was not even. The main advantage of our study is the originality and novelty of our data. This is the first study to focus on the sleep quality of the general population during the COVID-19 outbreak.According to our data, sleep was seriously affected during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. A large percentage of the study population reported poor quality of sleep and less duration during the lockdown week when compared to a normal week. However, individuals who reported good quality of sleep in the lockdown week also slept more in lockdown than those with average or bad quality of sleep, but not health professionals. The related factors included age, level of education, occupation, and country of residence.",Brazil,abstract,2020-12-05,12
bc736d84a08511b31fa37e3c6d1004febc230082,Efficacy and harms of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111Worldwide,~50 million patients have been infected with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , resulting in over 1.2 million deaths [1] . Older populations with obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease have a poorer prognosis when infected [2] . In the most severely ill COVID-19 patients, corticosteroid therapy has been shown to prolong survival but no other drugs have demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a reasonable safety profile [3] [4] [5] .Remdesivir inhibits ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase limiting viral replication [6, 7] . It was originally developed to treat Ebola but promising in vitro effects were not translated into acceptable clinical efficacy. Remdesivir provides antiviral effects on coronaviruses in vitro and early initiation of therapy significantly reduced pulmonary damage in monkeys infected with COVID-19 [6, 8] . Remdesivir received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on May 1 st 2020 and was approved on October 22, 2020 [9] . We systematically evaluated the human studies assessing the efficacy and safety of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19.Search strategies were adjusted for each engine using the keywords: remdesivir AND (COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR coronavirus disease OR coronavirus disease-19 OR severe acute respiratory syndrome OR SARS-CoV-2) with no limitations for time or language. The PubMed strategy is included in the S1 File. Included studies in our search involved case series, cohorts and RCTs that specified at least one efficacy or harm outcome. We excluded studies with hepatitis B or HIV coinfection patients.Three reviewers (VP, AP, LFN-S) collected records in www.myendnoteweb.com. Two independent reviewers (APdR, RC-V) assessed titles and abstracts for eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Three reviewers (LFN-S, APdR, RC-V) assessed full-text articles of selected studies. If two reviewers were unable to reach consensus, they consulted a third review author (AP). Three independent reviewers (LFN-S, APdR, RC-V) extracted data with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer (AP). Extracted information included: study authors, year of publication, study design, number of patients, country, median age, proportion of males, comorbidities (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), PCR method for COVID-19 diagnosis, remdesivir dose and duration, concomitant treatments for both arms, primary outcomes per arm, and secondary outcomes per arm.Primary outcomes were: all-cause mortality, clinical improvement (e.g. 2-point reduction in a 6-point ordinal severity scale), time to recovery (defined as first day, during 28-day enrollment, on which a patient satisfied categories 1, 2, or 3 of an 8-point ordinal scale), need for invasive ventilation (mechanical [MV] , extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]), and serious adverse events (SAE). Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay, components of ordinal severity scales, radiological progression of pneumonia, and adverse events (AE).Assessment of risk of bias was performed independently by two investigators (VP, AVH) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool [10] for RCTs. We planned to independently use the ROBINS-I tool [11] for cohort studies but no observational studies were found. A third reviewer (AP) resolved discrepancies when needed.We reported our systematic review according to 2009 PRISMA guidelines [12] . Effects of remdesivir on outcomes from individual studies were reported as hazard ratio (HR) or risk difference (RD) or relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, each with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Inverse variance random effect meta-analyses were performed when outcome data was available for at least two RCTs judged to have homogeneous study characteristics. Between study variance tau 2 was calculated with the Paule-Mandel method. Effects of meta-analyses were reported as relative risks (RR) and their 95%CIs, and heterogeneity of effects among studies was quantified with the I 2 statistic (an I 2 >60% means high heterogeneity of effects). R 3.5.1 (www.r-project.org) was used for meta-analyses. The quality or certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE methodology, which covers 5 items: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias [13] . Quality of evidence was evaluated per specific comparison and per outcome, and described in summary of findings (SoF) tables; GRADEpro GDT was used to create SoF tables [14] .From our searches, 553 records were screened for eligibility and eleven full-text articles were assessed (Fig 1) . One RCT planned in China (NCT04252664) was suspended on April 15 th , 2020. Five articles were excluded leaving two placebo-controlled RCTs (n = 1300), two RCTs comparing 5-day vs. 10-day regimens of remdesivir with or without a standard of care arm (n = 997), and two case series (n = 88) [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .Five of the six included studies had patients with similar baseline characteristics including severe or life-threatening patients with an oxygen saturation <94%. The Spinner et al. trial was unique in that it evaluated patients with mild to moderate severity of disease. The sample sizes ranged from 35 to 53 participants across case series, and 236 to 1063 across trials. Most of these studies compared intravenous (IV) remdesivir 200 mg as a loading dose and then 100 mg daily for 10 days vs. placebo or standard of care. However, Goldman et al. provided the 200mg loading dose to all participants and compared the 100mg daily dose for10 days vs. 5 days. The follow-up timeframe was 28 days in both case series and ranged between 11 and 29 days across trials.The description and demographic information of the included studies are shown in Table 1 . The median age of patients was between 63 to 64 years across case series and 58 to 66 years across trials. There was a predominance of male gender ranging between 56.3% to 75.4% across studies and comorbidities such as hypertension (24.5% to 50%) and diabetes (8.6% to 30.6%) varied between trials. Similar concomitant treatments were given in the trials such as corticosteroids, antivirals, antibiotics, and support therapy according to each hospital policy. [15] . The primary outcome was the time to clinical improvement within 28 days after randomization or time discharged alive from the hospital, whichever came first. Clinical improvement was defined as a decline of two points using a 6-point ordinal severity scale (Table 1 ). This scale was modified from a 7-point ordinal severity scale used by the COVID-19 lopinavir/ritonavir RCT by Cao et al. [21] , which has been used in previous influenza studies by Wang et al. [22] and recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) R&D Blueprint expert group [23] .Due to higher occurrence of AEs leading to drug discontinuation vs. placebo (12% vs 5%), the trial was stopped early, with 236 patients and a statistical power of 56%. Authors mentioned that they followed specific a priori termination criteria, but these are not available in the protocol [24] . Some imbalances existed at enrollment between arms, including more patients with hypertension, diabetes, or CAD in the remdesivir arm. Also, more patients in the control group had been symptomatic for �10 days at the time the intervention was started.Beigel et al. Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-1). The multinational Beigel et al. ACTT-1 RCT (NCT04280705) evaluated remdesivir 200 mg IV on day 1, followed by a 100mg IV once-daily for nine more days vs. placebo in adults with RT-PCR confirmed SARS--CoV-2 infection, pneumonia, and respiratory insufficiency (Table 1) [16, 25] . According to clinicaltrials.gov, on February 20 th 2020, its primary outcome was supposed to be percentage of each severity category at 15 days on the 7-point ordinal scale by Cao et al. [21] . On March 20 th 2020, the primary outcome was changed to a new 8-point ordinal severity scale, in which a subdivision into two groups was made on hospitalized patients (Table 1) .On March 22 nd 2020, blinded statisticians recommended again changing the outcome to time to recovery, defined as the first day during the 28 days satisfying category 1, 2 or 3 of the 8-point scale [16] . This trial was stopped on April 29 th 2020, as its safety monitoring board determined the primary efficacy endpoint had been achieved [25, 26] . At that moment, 1063 had been recruited with 482 recoveries and 81 deaths entered to the database [16] . No substantial imbalances in baseline characteristics were observed between the remdesivir and placebo arms. (Table 1 ) [19] . The primary outcome was changed after enrollment from proportion of patients with normalization of temperature at day 14 to clinical status evaluated at 14 days by a 7-point ordinal severity scale based on the 6-point scale of Wang et al. [15] but divided their non-oxygen user hospitalized patients into two categories regarding their need for clinical care. Both groups received supportive therapy at the discretion of the clinician. Secondary outcomes were time to clinical improvement (�2 points of ordinal scale), time to recovery (improvement from a baseline score of 2-5 to 6-7), time to modified recovery (improvement from a baseline score of 2-4 to 5-7 or from 5 to 6-7), all-cause mortality and safety.� † § § k k ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ -Gilead's open-label SIMPLE trial (NCT04292730) evaluated the efficacy and safety of remdesivir 5-day or 10-day plus standard of care vs. standard of care alone in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection and moderate pneumonia (e.g. without reduced oxygen levels) [20] . The primary outcome was clinical status evaluated by a 7-point ordinal severity scale at day 11 and the secondary outcome was the rate of adverse events between treatment arms. Clinical improvement was defined as 2 points improvement in the 7-point ordinal scale; also, a one-point improvement was assessed as well as the requirement of oxygen support or worsening of one point in the scale.Case series. The case series by Grein et al. [17] assessed 53 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, with oxygen saturation <94% receiving a similar 10-day remdesivir regimen and follow up as placebo-controlled RCTs [15, 16] . Clinical improvement (live discharge from the hospital, a decrease of �2 points on a modified 6-point ordinal scale) as suggested by the WHO [23] , changes in oxygen support, AEs, discharge, and deaths were recorded. Mean age was 64 years and 75% were male. About 60% had hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and asthma and most were on low flow oxygen support or invasive ventilation.The case series by Antinori et al. evaluated 35 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, with oxygen saturation <94% or mechanically ventilated or NEWS-2 score �4 [18] with similar remdesivir regimen and follow up as RCTs. They used the 7-point ordinal scale used by Cao There was no significant reduction in all-cause mortality vs. placebo at 14 days (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.28, I 2 = 43%, Fig 2) . There was no difference in mortality between 5-day and 10-day remdesivir arms in Goldman et al. (RR 0.75, 95%CI 0.40 to 1.40) [19] . All-cause mortality was not different between the 10-day, 5-day and SOC arms at 11 days (1%, 0%, 2%, respectively), and at 28 days (2%, 1%, 2%, respectively) in the Spinner [20] .Remdesivir did not decrease the need for invasive ventilation vs. placebo at 14 days (RR 0.57, 95%CI 0.23 to 1.42, I 2 = 60%, Fig 3) . Five-days of remdesivir treatment reduced the need for invasive ventilation vs. 10-day in Goldman et al. (RR 0.48, 0.27 to 0.84) [19] . SAEs were significantly lower with remdesivir vs. placebo (RR 0.77, 95%CI 0.63 to 0.94) (S1 Fig). In Beigel et al. ACCT-1, SAEs were present in 21% vs. 27% in remdesivir and placebo, respectively [16] . The most common SAEs were acute respiratory failure, hypotension, viral pneumonia and acute kidney injury but were more frequent in the placebo arm. In Goldman et al., SAEs were more frequent in the 10-day remdesidivir arm (21% vs 35%), with respiratory failure being the most commonly seen [19] . SAEs were less frequent in the 5-day and 10-day remdesivir vs. SOC arms (4.7%, 5.2%, and 9.0%) in the Spinner et al. trial [20] . Grein et al. reported 23% of SAEs, most commonly multiple organ failure, septic shock, kidney injury and hypotension with an 8% drug discontinuation rate [17] . There was no effect of remdesivir on hospitalization without oxygen or with oxygen support/ non-invasive ventilation vs. placebo (S2 and S3 Figs; explanation of ordinal scale re-categorization across RCTs in S3 File). A higher proportion of patients were discharged if treated with remdesivir (S4 Fig), and there was no difference in treatment discontinuation (S5 Fig) vs. placebo. There was no difference in AEs in the two placebo-controlled RCTs (RR 0.94, 95%CI 0.81 to 1.10) (S6 Fig). AEs were similar between 5-day and 10-day remdesivir arms (71 vs 74%) [17] , but higher in 5-day or 10-day arm vs. standard of care arm (51.3%, 58.5%, 46.5%) [18] . No differences were found between remdesivir vs. placebo on specific AEs such as anemia, elevated liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or renal impairment (S7-S13 Figs).Antinori et al. reported that 43% of subjects had elevated liver enzymes, 23% had acute kidney injury, and 20% had elevated bilirubin levels [18] . Overall, 23% of AEs led to drug discontinuation [18] . Grein et al. reported that 60% of patients experienced AEs including elevated liver enzymes (23%), diarrhea (9%) and rash (8%) [17] . None of the studies documented radiological progression of pulmonary disease or viral clearance.The quality of evidence for primary and secondary outcomes per comparison are shown in Table 2 (remdesivir 10 days vs. placebo), Table 3 (remdesivir 5 days vs. 10 days), Table 4 (remdesivir 5 days vs. standard of care), and S1 Table (remdesivir 10 days vs. standard of care). Overall quality of evidence was low or very low for all primary and secondary outcomes, mainly due to some concerns or high risk of bias among RCTs, and inconsistency and imprecision of effects. Indirectness was present when assessing the Spinner et al. trial as its population were moderate COVID-19 patients in contrast to severe COVID-19 patients in other three trials. The risk of bias analysis of four RCTs using Cochrane's RoB 2.0. tool is shown in S14 and S15 Figs. The Wang et al. trial was judged to have some concerns due to potential confounding on the randomization process. The Beigel et al. trial was judged to have high risk of bias due to selection of the reported results, as their primary outcome was time to recovery after two previous changes. The Goldman et al. trial was judged to have serious risk of bias due to the measurement of the outcome, as they used a non-validated 7-point disease severity scale. The Spinner et al. trial was judged to have some concerns due to selection of the reported results.S2 Table describes details of four ongoing remdesivir RCTs [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Further details of these RCTs can also be found in the S2 File.In adult, hospitalized, RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients with respiratory insufficiency or pneumonia, there were scarce data on efficacy and safety associated with the use of 10-day remdesivir regimens, or with the comparison of 5-day or 10-day regimens vs. standard of care. Two RCTs used a common treatment regimen and a true placebo control, and two RCTs compared two different doses of remdesivir, including one RCT with standard of care. Three trials were focused on severely ill COVID-19 patients, while one RCT was in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir did not decrease all-cause mortality and need for invasive ventilation vs. placebo at 14 days but had fewer SAEs. Five-days of remdesivir decreased need for invasive ventilation and SAEs vs. 10-days of therapy. No differences in all-cause mortality or SAEs were seen among 5-days of 10-days of remdesivir and standard of care. Time to recovery was decreased by 4 days when remdesivir was compared to placebo, and by 0.8 days when patients were given 5-days of remdesivir vs. 10-days of therapy. Clinical improvement was higher with5-days of remdesivir vs. standard of care. The RCTs ranged from some concerns of bias to high risk of bias, and quality of evidence was low to very low for all outcomes and all comparisons.The While overall mortality is the most important final health outcome, it was not the primary endpoint of any of the available trials. Clinical severity is a relevant clinical outcome, but the ordinal scale used in these trials has not been validated before or appropriately analyzed. Indeed, there is not a correlation between clinical important differences and changes in scale scores in these trials. That may be because only the Beigel et al. and Spinner et al. trials used the proportional odds models and no trial used other methods such as the sliding dichotomy model. Serious adverse events, such as acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and hypotension, are relevant as main metrics of safety.Wang et al. RCT was stopped prematurely due to an excess of serious adverse events causing drug discontinuation, and Beigel et al. preliminarily reported their data at 15-days. While Wang et al. stated the use of a priori protocol that specified their stopping rule, there is no independent verification in their publicly available protocol. The demographic differences, with more remdesivir patients having hypertension, diabetes, or CAD, would be more likely to work against remdesivir efficacy. While more patients in the control group had been symptomatic for �10 days at the time of starting the intervention, this is not expected to cause more outcomes to occur. In Beigel et al., they changed their primary outcome twice [25] with no In comparison to placebo, remdesivir did not significantly impact all-cause mortality, need of invasive ventilation, hospitalization without oxygen, hospitalization with oxygen or non-invasive ventilation, or treatment discontinuation. There was a significantly lower incidence of SAEs and higher proportion of discharged patients in RCTs comparing remdesivir to placebo. In comparison to 10-days of remdesivir therapy in Goldman et al., the 5-day regimen did not decrease mortality but decreased need for invasive ventilation and SAEs. AEs were similar between remdesivir and placebo arms and between the 5-day vs 10-day remdesivir arms. No differences in all-cause mortality, SAEs or AEs were seen among the 5-day, 10-day and standard of care arms in the Skinner et al. trial. There were substantial differences between the two-case series in the magnitude of their outcomes.There were some differences in the scales used to assess outcomes across studies as shown in Table 1 [20] . These scales were strongly correlated, and that allowed us to formally group those scale categories in five in order to perform our meta-analyses for the two placebo-controlled RCTs [15, 16] ; explanations are shown in S3 File. It is important to highlight that although these types of scales are based on a blueprint from WHO, neither of them has been fully validated as a disease severity index, and there is no current information about a more proper tool to assess the severity of COVID-19 [23] .Remdesivir is FDA approved and indicated for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who are 12 years of age and older, and who weigh at least 40 kg. It should only be administered in a hospital or in a healthcare setting capable of providing acute care comparable to inpatient hospital care. We disagree that the currently available data is sufficiently strong to support its FDA approval, given that it is not possible to fully assess the balance of benefits to harms in COVID-19 infected patients. There is a risk that the benefits and harms of remdesivir will remain unknown if other remdesivir RCTs vs. placebo are stopped and substituted with trials where remdesivir becomes the standard of care and other experimental drugs are added onto remdesivir versus remdesivir alone. Patients may specifically ask for remdesivir therapy if they are not candidates for corticosteroid therapy and feel a failure to use an FDA approved option is a substandard practice.Our systematic review has several strengths. We ran a recent and extensive systematic search in several engines and websites, and we did not restrict by language. We found commonalities across all studies: adult, hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and in particular patients with pneumonia and respiratory insufficiency. All six studies evaluated the same loading dose and a similar daily dose, albeit for different days of therapy, and two RCTs were compared to placebo. We also systematically searched for worldwide ongoing RCTs and ongoing systematic reviews in PROSPERO that can be found in S3 Table. Some limitations can be highlighted. First, the number of RCTs was scarce, the reporting of the Beigel et al. trial is based on 15-day outcomes of the totality of recruited patients, and the Spinner et al. trial compared outcomes over11 days. Second, the Wang et al. RCT was stopped early because a higher proportion of adverse events leading to drug discontinuation was found in an unplanned interim analysis [15] . Third, our meta-analyses for primary outcomes and secondary outcomes were based only on two placebo-controlled RCTs and we used outcomes at similar time points of follow up and re-categorized heterogeneous ordinal outcome scales into five categories. Based on this, conclusions about mortality, need for invasive ventilation, and SAEs should be interpreted with caution. Whether it is the six-or seven-point scales used by investigators, these scales do not have an established minimum clinically important difference. Finally, three of the RCTs included patients given therapy within 10 to 15 days of when symptoms began. Remdesivir's antiviral activity should be the highest during the first few days of active viral multiplication, as supported by a study performed in monkeys where early administration of remdesivir prevent progression to pneumonia after SARS-CoV-2 inoculation [8] .There is paucity of adequately powered and fully reported RCTs evaluating efficacy and harms of remdesivir use in adult, hospitalized, COVID-19 patients. One RCT was stopped early without a clear description of the reasons, the largest trial (Beigel et al. ACTT-1), altered their primary endpoint twice and only reported 15-day outcomes, the Goldman et al. and Spinner et al. SIMPLE trials did not have a placebo arm, and the Spinner et al. SIMPLE trial outcomes were reported at 11 days. Conclusions about overall mortality, need for invasive ventilation, and SAEs from meta-analyses of two trials should be interpreted with caution. Several ongoing RCTs should be completed despite the FDA approval in order to determine remdesivir's clinical efficacy and harm profile. Until stronger evidence emerges, we cannot conclude that remdesivir is efficacious for treating COVID-19. ",Peru,first author,2020-12-10,12

Esta realidad pone en riesgo el seguimiento de patologías crónicas como las demencias. Asimismo, la atención de las posibles complicaciones neuropsiquiátricas relacionadas al aislamiento preventivo de la población (cuarentena), que en el caso de Argentina, se considera la más prolongada la Latinoamérica. El objetivo del presente trabajo es determinar la frecuencia de las distintas modalidades de consulta médica en relación a la patología neurocognitiva del paciente y las variables predictoras de consulta desde el inicio de la cuarentena.Métodos: Estudio descriptivo observacional, transversal basado en la recolección de datos a través de una encuesta.Resultados: Hubo 324 participantes, 165 (50,9%) de los cuales realizaron al menos una consulta médica. Frecuencia de modalidades de consulta: teléfono, 109 (33,6%); correo electrónico, 62 (19,1%); videoconsulta, 30 (9,3%); servicio de emergencias, 23 (7,1%). Predictores de consulta: Clinical Dementia Rating ≥1 (p < 0,001); diagnóstico: Alzheimer (p = 0,017). Se encon-traron puntajes más altos del Inventario Neuropsiquiátrico (NPI) en el grupo que ha realizado consultas médicas (p < 0,001). Dicha diferencia no fue observada en el puntaje de la escala decarga del cuidador (Zarit).Healthcare systems in numerous countries around the world are Q8 severely overburdened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. 1 Resources and efforts are urgently being redistributed as part of the response to the pandemic; this process will disproportionately affect countries with weak economies and vulnerable populations, including individuals with cognitive impairment or dementia. Latin American and Caribbean countries present unstable economic development, fragile healthcare systems, vast economic disparities, and high prevalence of dementia. The pandemic has had a concerning selective impact on cognitive disorders in the region, creating tensions in specialised healthcare systems and exacerbating health inequities. 2 Neurology departments have changed their activities in response to the pandemic: most neurologists are currently contributing to the management of patients with COVID-19, which has frequently been prioritised over the follow-up of patients with chronic neurological conditions. 3 It is important to be aware of the challenges facing elderly people and those with existing conditions, such as dementia, who are now confined to their homes and have become more vulnerable.In the early stages of development, cognitive disorders frequently present with behavioural symptoms, 4 resulting in caregiver burden of variable severity. 5 Since the beginning of the pandemic, news media have reported chaotic and dangerous situations, which may have caused fear among the population; this has led to delays in patients contacting healthcare systems, negatively affecting the follow-up of chronic conditions and the prevention of new comorbidities. 3 Dementia, and particularly advanced dementia, is a significant risk factor for patients with COVID-19: patients with dementia present higher rates of mortality due to COVID-19 than those without the condition (62.2% vs 26.2%). 6 Furthermore, the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in patients with dementia may be atypical (behavioural changes or exacerbation of dementia progression, with fever being infrequent); this hinders early detection and hospitalisation, leading to poorer outcomes in this population group. Therefore, we must ensure proper follow-up of these patients in this unprecedented situation.In Argentina, lockdown measures were put in place on 20 March 2020, at a critical moment of the pandemic. 7 At that time, the Ministry of Health ordered the cancellation of outpatient consultations at hospitals and other healthcare institutions, with care provision restricted to emergency situations; this measure was gradually eased, and in-person consultations were restored, with stricter protocols in place. Modern telemedicine was also implemented in some centres. 8 This has led to a drastic renewal of the healthcare system, which is not free of difficulties for some elderly patients, many of whom live in homes without sufficient access to technology.These developments have led to significant problems: firstly, there is a considerable risk that the follow-up of patients with dementia (who are at greater risk from COVID-19) may be interrupted; secondly, it is difficult to access healthcare resources in the event of cognitive or behavioural changes resulting from the pandemic, prolonged confinement, or stress. 2The primary objective of this study was to determine the frequency with which different methods of medical consultation were used since the beginning of lockdown by the caregivers of patients with neurocognitive disorders.We also aimed to define the variables associated with medical consultations and emergency consultations during the lockdown period (age, sex, level of schooling, level of caregiver burden [Zarit Burden Interview; ZBI 9 ], type of dementia, severity of dementia [Clinical Dementia Rating; CDR 10 ], and behavioural manifestations [Neuropsychiatric Inventory; NPI 11 ]), as well as the variables associated with use of video consultations (age and level of schooling).We performed a cross-sectional, observational, descriptive study based on data gathered through a survey of patients' caregivers.Anonymised data were collected using a survey completed on a voluntary basis by formal and informal caregivers of patients with cognitive disorders or dementia of different levels of severity, who had visited Hospital Dr. César Milstein (Buenos Aires, Argentina) at some time, for a variety of reasons (referral to specialist departments, neurocognitive assessment, second opinion consultations, family counselling, outreach lectures, cognitive workshops, etc); we established no restrictions based on age or the aetiology of cognitive disorders. We also distributed the survey among relatives or caregivers who attended support groups attached to the Asociación de Lucha contra el Mal de Alzheimer y alteraciones semejantes (''Association Against Alzheimer Disease''), both in Buenos Aires and at the association's other centres. We excluded patients who did not have caregivers older than 18 years, who could not be contacted, and/or who were unable to complete the survey for technical reasons.We used e-mail and mobile instant messaging applications to distribute a self-administered questionnaire to caregivers. We collected data on patients' and caregivers' age and sex, aetiology of the patients' cognitive disorders, the relationship between patient and caregiver, caregivers' level of schooling, exacerbation of behavioural symptoms (NPI symptom items) or caregiver burden (ZBI) during lockdown, and the method of consultation during lockdown (telephone, e-mail, video consultation, emergency department). Data were collected between 24 April and 1 July 2020. During this period, Buenos Aires was under phases 1, 2, and 3 of lockdown.Independent variables in the statistical analysis were patients' and caregivers' sociodemographic characteristics (caregiver age, sex, level of schooling, and relationship to the patient; patient age, sex, CDR score, and diagnosis), ZBI score, and NPI score. Descriptive statistics are expressed as mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range [IQR]), as appropriate. In the bivariate analysis, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric variables and the t test, 2 test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for parametric variables. Statistical analysis was conducted using the SPSS statistics software (version 25).The study is considered a low-risk observational study according to A total of 324 caregivers responded to the survey. Caregivers' and patients' characteristics are summarised in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.Medical consultations during lockdown: 165 respondents (50.9%) consulted healthcare professionals at least once, with 45 (13.8%) using more than one method of consultation.Methods of consultation: 52.7% of respondents consulted via telephone (109; 33.6%) or email (62; 19.1%), 30 (9.3%) used video consultation, and 23 (7.1%) consulted through the emergency department. 1 Disease progression (CDR score): CDR ≥ 1: 122 (57.5%) vs CDR = 0.5: 43 (38.4%); P < .001 ( 2 ). 2 Diagnosis: Alzheimer-type dementia: 71 (59%) vs non-Alzheimertype dementia: 94 (45.9%); P = .017 ( 2 ). 3 Total NPI score: median NPI score (IQR) was 20 (34) in patients who consulted and 9 (17) in those who did not; P < .001 (Mann-Whitney U test). 4 NPI symptom items: patients who consulted presented greater prevalence of hallucinations (P = .008), agitation/aggression (P < .001), depression (P = .0017), anxiety (P < .001), irritability (P < .001), and night-time behaviour disturbances (P < .001) ( 2 ). Data on NPI symptom items are presented in Fig. 1 1 Disease progression (CDR score): CDR ≥ 1: 20 (9.4%) vs CDR = 0.5: 3 (2.7%); P = .002 ( 2 ). 2 Diagnosis:Alzheimer-type dementia: 11 (9.2%) vs non-Alzheimer-type dementia: 12 (5.9%); this difference was not statistically significant ( 2 ). 3 Total NPI score: median NPI score (IQR) was 37 (59) in patients who consulted and 12 (21) in those who did not; P < .001 (Mann-Whitney U test). 4 NPI symptom items: patients who consulted presented greater prevalence of hallucinations (P = .008), agitation/aggression (P = .003), anxiety (P < .001), irritability (P < .001), and aberrant motor behaviour (P = .009) ( 2 ).5 ZBI score: no statistically significant differences in caregiver burden were identified between caregivers who did and did not consult the emergency department (median score 1 Caregiver age: caregivers who used video consultation were younger than those who used other methods of consultation (P = .03). 2 Caregiver level of schooling: no statistically significant differences were identified (t test).The populations of numerous countries have been placed under preventive isolation (quarantine) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which represents a true challenge for healthcare systems around the world, 12 and particularly in Latin American countries. In Argentina, the infection was first detected on 3 March, 64 days after the first case was reported in China. Since then, the government of Argentina has introduced a range of measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic; a multiple-phase lockdown implemented on 20 March remains in place in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area, which has a population of 15 million and presents a high COVID-19 incidence rate. 8 In this context, our findings show the significant prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms during lockdown in a study population from this region (both patients and caregivers). Over 90% of patients presented neuropsychiatric alterations; 63% of caregivers showed signs of burden, with nearly half presenting severe burden. However, despite the high prevalence of behavioural alterations, only 50% of respondents consulted at least once during lockdown. Prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients who did and did not attend medical consultations during lockdown. *No significant differences; + P = .008; § P < .001; || P = .0017; ¶ P < .001; ++ P < .001; § § P < .001.It should be noted that most studies in the literature report that confinement has negative psychological consequences, with some suggesting that these effects may be extensive, severe, and longlasting. 13 However, these conclusions are drawn from population studies; to date, no study has examined the effects of lockdown on the elderly population with cognitive impairment and dementia. According to Paola Barbarino, the executive director of Alzheimer's Disease International, the most vulnerable population segments were overlooked when countries rushed to implement lockdown measures, exacerbating feelings of anxiety and loneliness. 14 Regarding the methods of consultation, we observed that caregivers older than 60 years mainly consulted via telephone and e-mail, with only 9% of participants using the video consultation system; this small percentage corresponded to caregivers aged under 60 years.Patients who consulted mainly had Alzheimer-type dementia; CDR scores ≥1; high prevalence of hallucinations, depression, anxiety, irritability, and night-time behaviour disturbances; and higher NPI scores than those who did not consult medical professionals.Patients who directly consulted the emergency department (oncall service) presented higher NPI scores and greater prevalence of disruptive symptoms, and frequently presented aberrant motor behaviours and hallucinations.Argentina is currently at a critical stage of the pandemic, with a considerable rise in COVID-19 cases and deaths, as well as secondary effects related to the pandemic and the prolonged confinement period. Elderly individuals with cognitive disorders and dementia, who are at high risk from COVID-19, must be able to continue with their treatment and have access to medical consultations, beyond the classic in-person model. The high prevalence of mental health disorders in the elderly population must be a priority in the region's healthcare agenda. 2 It is noteworthy that half of the patients and caregivers surveyed did not consult at any time, despite the high prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms. The digital divide and the scarcity of technological resources in patients' homes may contribute to the social exclusion of this population with regard to the use of more technologically complex methods of consultation at this critical time.Neurology departments must reconsider their working practices to ensure that patients with neurological disorders are able to access the care they need, and work to develop appropriate safety protocols and offer different methods of medical consultation. 15 Telemedicine via video consultation may only be useful for a limited number of older patients. We propose that telephone and e-mail consultation should be considered as simple, accessible tools for the follow-up of this population group during the pandemic, enabling early interventions based on patients' clinical condition pending the implementation of more complex telemedicine systems.Public health management requires rapid decision-making and profound changes in response to the pandemic; however, we must not neglect the general management of all patients, nor underestimate the emotional impact of the pandemic and lockdown on this group of patients and their families.Research efforts during the pandemic should contribute highquality information that may improve the care provided to the population in times of crisis.The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.

0f66157fcfd5417f354243a9ec88e8d3f5ce3da0,Enhancing the estimation of compartmental model parameters for COVID-19 data with a high level of uncertainty,"Since the onset of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, at the end of 2019, a wealth of research have been carried out from across the globe, aiming to understand the dynamics of the disease and transmission patterns. Even after almost a year since the notification of the first case, the number of infected individuals keeps rising significantly. In the meantime, the confirmation of reinfections and identification of seasonal immunity [1] reinforces the need for actions to contain the disease, even in locations where the epidemic would be under control.Governmental decisions to mitigate the spread of the disease, such as the introduction of lockdown and social distancing measures, are usually based on computational simulations whose preeminent objective are to predict the way the disease spreads in the population, considering continuously reported data [2] . However, there are several factors associated with natural, economic, and social aspects that make it difficult to adequately predict the spread of the disease and, consequently, the definition of a comprehensive policy for prevention and control of the disease [3, 4, 5] . The heterogeneity of the population in relation to attributes such as demographic diversity, age-dependent characteristics, and randomness related to the mobility and interaction of individuals makes it hardly possible to create a model capable of incorporating all these features together (see, for instance, Refs. [6, 7, 8, 9] ).Asymptomatic people also play a significant role in the ongoing pandemic. Oran and Topol [10] presented a comprehensive bibliographic review on the estimation of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 in different parts of the world and concluded that the proportion of asymptomatic individuals may vary from 40% to 45% in relation to the total number of reported cases. The scenario of widespread underreporting coupled with a deficient screening and testing capacity leads to significant uncertainty in relation to the reported data of infected individuals. The impact of such uncertainties is analyzed by Ioannidis [11] , Li et al. [12] , and Wu et al. [13] .Turning attention to the impact of the pandemic in Brazil, a country with a continental dimension, such problems tend to become even more evident [14] . Socioeconomic inequalities [15, 16] and cultural factors [17, 18] have a direct impact on access to information and health services, which translates into high rates of infection and, as a consequence, underreporting cases. Veiga e Silva et al. [19] also analyze presumptive inconsistencies in the data collected and made available by the Ministry of Health in Brazil. They report that, according to the methodology adopted in their analysis, there may be a difference of approximately 41% in the number of deaths caused by complications arising from COVID- 19. In an attempt to better describe the effects of COVID-19 on different population groups, several models have been proposed, aiming to provide more accurate forecasts by means of integrating typical features related to the disease, such as the quarantine period, lockdown, social distancing and hospitalization. Massonis et al. [20] bring together several of these models, classifying them hierarchically in relation to the number of coupled features. In general, even the most complex models, that is, those with supposedly more capacity to associate knowledge about the spreading dynamics of the disease, tend to experience some difficulties in identifying the behavior of noisy data in the long-term, as shown by Alberti and Faranda [21] and Roda et al. [3] .The major motivation of this work is to provide alternatives to enhance the capacity of estimating parameters in compartmental models and predicting the spread of COVID-19, taking into account data with a high level of uncertainty, such as the number of new cases reported in the state of Rio de Janeiro since March 05, 2020, as shown in Fig. 1 . The data do not have a well-defined behavior, in such a way that the variations in subsequent days are caused, in part, by the factors that deepen the disparities in the notifications of cases of infection. In addition, the Brazilian government estimates the COVID-19 data considering the daily count in the municipalities-Brazil is made up of 5570 municipalities, of which 92 make up the state of Rio de Janeiro-which are autonomous in relation to population testing policy and do not follow a common strategy to prevent the disease. As in some locations data are not reported on weekends, there are sudden drops in the number of new infections, which afterwards cause unexpected increases when data are reported in the begining of the following week. In this context, the main objective of this work is to propose the use of strategies capable of reducing the variability of the estimation of compartmental model parameters, in order to expand the predictive capacity of such models. We propose that the noisy data set be regularized by means of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). This approach allows a set of data to be smoothed, so as to decrease its noise level without significantly changing its behavior. To confirm this assumption, we compared a subgroup of reported data on dead and infected individuals in the state of Rio de Janeiro to simulations produced by the SEIRPD-Q model, whose parameters are estimated using regularized data. The results obtained are also compared to the simulations calculated in the usual way, without regularizing the data, in order to quantify the predictive capacity in relation to known data and the gain in relation to the parameter estimation approach with unchanged data.A recent review of the literature on the subject found that, to date, few works that incorporate the concepts of Gaussian Process (GP) applied to the epidemiological modeling of COVID-19 have been published. These works are briefly presented below. Ketu and Mishra [22] proposed the Multi-Task GPR model, aiming to predict the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide. The authors compared the results obtained with other regression models, in order to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method. Zhou and Ji [23] proposed a model for transmission dynamics of COVID-19 considering underreporting of cases (what they called undocumented infections) and estimated the time-varying disease rate of transmission using GPR and a Bayesian approach. Arias Velásquez and Mejía Lara [24] demonstrated the correlation between industrial air pollution and infections by COVID-19 before and after the quarantine in Peru, by presenting a classification model using Reduced-Space GPR. This methodology is used by the same authors in Ref. [24] to report a long-term forecast for COVID-19 in the USA. In turn, Ribeiro et al. [25] compared the predictive capacity of various machine learning regression and statistical models, considering short-term forecasting of COVID-19 cumulative cases in Brazil. As far as we aware this is the first time that GPR is employed for regularization of data, which are subsequently analyzed using a compartmental model (although other methods for regularization have been applied [12] ).We also partition the data sets between training and test data, and carry out successive parameter estimations varying the proportion between these types of data, in order to show the behavior of the obtained parameter set. We show that some of these parameters can be approximated by functions and, considering this possibility, we analyze the influence of adopting variable parameters over time. We use both a deterministic approach, in terms of least squares, to estimate the gain related to the use of regularized data and time-varying parameters, and a Bayesian approach, in order to analyze the uncertainties related to calibration, as well as aspects such as non-identifiability.In order to understand the model response to noisy data, we adopt an extension of the compartmental SEIR model, termed SEIRPD-Q model, which encompasses concepts of the models proposed by Jia et al. [26] and Volpatto et al. [27] . Initially, consider a population susceptible to a viral outbreak, whose rate of transmission per contact is given by β. Infected individuals may experience a latent period, becoming infectious only after this stage, even without showing any sign of disease. Individuals in such conditions are said to be exposed, with incubation period given by 1/σ. We divide this group into infected and positively diagnosed compartments, based on the premise that a large number of individuals who contract the virus are not diagnosed. This is due to the reduced testing capacity in some locations and, as a consequence of this policy, the diagnosis is made, primarily, in individuals who have severe symptoms or are hospitalized. The proportion of infected individuals, given by ρ, is related to the majority of people that only suffer mild symptoms and get recovered without significant complications. On the other hand, the complement of this group are those who, in fact, have been positively diagnosed. In turn, individuals who recover from the disease after being in the infected compartment are moved to the removed compartment at a rate of γ I . The same goes for positively diagnosed individuals, that are removed at a rate of γ P .Quarantine measures are also incorporated in this model, affecting the susceptible, exposed, and infected compartments. Individuals in these compartments are kept in quarantine at a rate of ω, and are not assumed to be infectious considering restrictive quarantine measures. The quarantine compartment is implicitly modeled and, therefore, the removed compartment includes individuals who have undergone quarantine, along with those who have been infected and have recovered from the disease. In addition, it is reasonable to assume that most of the individuals who died from complications caused by the disease had severe symptoms and were tested or hospitalized. Therefore, we do not consider that individuals in the infected compartment die from virus-related causes without being diagnosed, and the mortality rate of positively diagnosed individuals is given by d P . The mathematical formulation of the SEIRPD-Q model is given by Eq. (1), and its schematic description is presented in Fig. 2 .The model adopted presents some fundamental differences in relation to those on which we are based: first, Jia et al. [26] consider that only susceptible individuals are subject to quarantine measures, which is modeled using an explicit compartment and also considering an additional parameter that controls the social distancing relaxation; second, we disregard the asymptomatic compartment due to the uncertainties regarding the reported data, and incorporate the dynamics related to positively diagnosed individuals, of which data are more reliable (as proposed by Volpatto et al. [27] ); third, we consider only the mortality rate of positively diagnosed individuals, unlike Volpatto et al. [27] . Additionally, we also compute the cumulative number of infected and dead individuals, which are respectively given byThese quantities are used in the estimation of the model parameters and the term cumulative number of infected individuals is often used interchangeably with confirmed cases throughout the text.Given the m-dimensional vector θ of model parameters, model responses at different times t i , for i = 1, . . . , p, are denoted by y The objective of the inverse problem is, therefore, to find the vectorθ (an estimate of θ) that produces outputsŷ ( j) i capable of fitting the available observations. The best fit between the responses of the modelŷ ∈ R p and the observed data can be estimated in terms of the residuals, the difference between observed and predicted measurements, given by r (θ) =ŷ − D. The solution to an inverse problem is, in other words, the data fitting whose objective is to calculate an estimateθ that minimizes some error norm r of the residuals [28, 29] . The least squares fitting calculates the vector of optimal parameters by taking the mean squared error, given byand the estimateθ is the vector that minimizes this quantity:Equation (2) is usually called the objective function (or cost function). When E → 0, the estimateθ generates an output vectorŷ that has a high level of agreement with the observed data D, that is, the residuals are minimized. In general, real problems do not admit E = 0, since the noise that affects the model cannot be predicted with such accuracy.Bayesian inference provides another perspective for estimating the value of a set of parameters that best characterizes the output of a model, given a set of data. Bayesian inference differs from the deterministic approach by quantifying uncertainty, which is one of the focuses of this work. To conduct Bayesian inference, we need some familiarity with a few basic concepts of probability. Here, we give a brief overview of such concepts. A more detailed description is provided by Refs. [30, 31, 32] .Bayes theorem provides a formulation to estimate the posterior probability of the model parameters given a set of observations D, based on the likelihood of the event of interest occuring given the prior knowledge on the parameters. The theorem is stated aswhere p like (D | θ) is the likelihood function, p prior (θ) is the prior information or beliefs on θ, p evid (D) is the evidence related to the observations D, and p post (θ | D) is the posterior distribution associated with θ. A prior knowledge can be thought of as the probability density function over the feasible values of the model parameters, the current knowledge on their values. In turn, the likelihood assumes the role of estimating the probability of characterizing the data we have available, given a set of parameters. In other words, the likelihood function measures how good the data are being explained by the model. In this work we assume a Gaussian likelihood, which has the formin which σ 2 j is a measure of the uncertainty (encompassing data errors) related to each quantity j, for j ∈ {C, D}. Here, both σ 2 C and σ 2 D are considered hyperparameters to be estimated together with the set of parameters θ. The evidence, also referred to as marginal likelihood, is the integral of the likelihood over the prior and are considered as a normalization constant. Thus, we actually evaluate p post (θ | D) ∝ p like (D | θ) p prior (θ) to produce the posterior distribution p post (θ | D) over the parameters, that is, and updated belief about θ, given D.Here we describe the general GP framework, with special attention to regression problems using noisy observations. By definition, a GP is a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution [35] . In other words, it is an extension of the multivariate Gaussian distributions to infinite dimensionality. GPRs take place directly in the space of functions, defining priors over functions that, once we have seen some data, can be converted into posteriors over functions [36] . Thus, a GPR model is a Bayesian nonlinear regression model that takes into account the GP prior and whose posterior is the desired regression function that belongs to an infinite dimension random function space [37] .To introduce the GP, denote by t = t 1 , . . . , t p T the time training points associated to a finite set of p observationsWe assume that each observation D at location t is a random variable associated to the GP stochastic processcompletely defined by its mean function m (t) = E f (t) , the expected value of all functions in the distribution evaluated for an arbitrary input t, andwhich describes the dependence between the function values for a pair of arbitrary input time points t and t . We now consider the regression problemwith ε being an additive Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance σ 2 . The GPR begins by assuming the vectorvalue function f ∼ N (0, K) as the prior distribution, where K is the p × p covariance matrix whose entries are k (t, t ).Considering this prior and noise in the time training set, as defined in Eq. (4), the joint distribution taking into account new input time points t * and their associated output D * is given bywhere I stands for the p × p identity matrix. Therefore, the predictive equations for GPR are derived from the conditional distribution property for the multivariate Gaussian distribution [35] . Considering the Schur complement (for more details on Schur complements, refer to Puntanen and Styan [38] ), the posterior predictive distribution is the multivariate Gaussian distributionwith meanand covariance matrixTherefore, the calculation of Eqs. (6) and (7) is sufficient to predict D * . Note that this involves first calculating the four covariance matrices. Furthermore, the covariance depends only on the time training set (t) and the new input points (t * ), and not on the observation measures vector (D). By aplying the GPR methodology to the observation set D ( j) , for j ∈ {C, D}, we then obtain p D ( j) * | t * , t, D ( j) , whose corresponding mean values at the time training points are the regularized data used in this work. The covariance function is commonly called the kernel of the GP. This function maps a pair of general input vectors t, t ∈ t into R. The idea behind the kernel is that if t and t are said to be similar, it is expected that the function output (observations) at these points will also be similar. The main attribute of the kernel is to avoid the computation of an explicit nonlinear mapping function that relates input and output data, obtaining the identification of the mapping in the space where the number of parameters to be optimized, the so-called hyperparameters, is smaller [39] . Thus, the choice of an appropriate kernel is usually based on prior knowledge related to the behavior of the training data, as for example the occurrence of periodic oscillations, and assumptions such as smoothness [40] . Finding suitable properties for the kernel function is one of the main tasks for defining an appropriate GP.Its main component belongs to the Matérn class of covariance functions and is given bywhere r = |t − t |, ν and are positive constants, and Γ(ν) and K ν are the gamma and a modified Bessel functions, respectively. The two other components are the dot product and the constant kernels. The former is given by k d (t, t ) = σ 2 d + t · t , and the latter is defined as k c (t, t ) = c, where c is a real-valued constant. The hyperparameters ν controls the smoothness of the function, is the characteristic length scale, and σ 2 d and c are multiplicative and additive scale factors, respectively.Rasmussen and Williams [35] present an algorithm for GPR employing Cholesky factorization to solve the matrix inversion required by Eqs. (6) and (7). We use the Scikit-learn library [42] to implement the GPR. Hyperparameters are calculated using a computational routine internal to the library, which uses the L-BFGS-B algorithm [43] to obtain the optimal values. The optimizer is restarted 50 times in order to increase the chances of convergence to the optimal set of hyperparameters. In fact, the number of restarts is an arbitrary choice and, as the GPR is executed only once, the computational cost associated with this procedure is negligible.The data used in this work are the cumulative number of infected individuals and the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 in the state of Rio de Janeiro. The Brazilian Ministry of Health reports the data daily, which are synthesized and made available as shown in Ref. [44] . The analyzed data refer to the period between March 10, 2020 and October 5, 2020, consisting of 210 records. Although the number of recovered individuals is also available, it may be wise not to use this data to estimate the parameters of model since, due to the unseemly policy of testing the population, there is much uncertainty about these data, given that the number of infected individuals is not known with relative accuracy. In addition, we adopt the cumulative number of infected individuals, rather than the number of new daily cases, as an attempt to mitigate the effects of noise caused by inconsistent data (as can be seen in Fig. 1 ).In models with more compartments and which, in general, have more parameters, finding a unique set of parameter that best fits some data may be unattainable. Different combinations of parameters can produce similar results for data fitting. This fact is a characteristic of the non-identifiability of parameters [45] . Therefore, the parameters to be estimated are the rate of transmission β, rate of removal due to quarantine measures ω, and mortality rate d P . The remaining parameters of the model are assumed to be known biological parameters. In this case, the incubation period isσ = 1/5.8 day −1 [46] , the proportion of symptomatic infected individuals is ρ = 0.6 [10] , and both the recovery rate of infected and positively diagnosed individuals are defined as γ I = γ P = 1/16.7 day −1 [47] .Arbitrarily, we choose the minimum size of the training data set equal to 60. In our first analysis, we set up 7 values in the test data set and calculate successive estimates of the parameters of the model, gradually increasing the proportion between training and test data. After each run, a new data is added to the training set, so that the test set is composed of the next 7 values in the time series. As data for 210 days are available, 143 sets of parameters are estimated, using the deterministic approach described in Section 2.2. This procedure is performed both using training data as it stands, and after regularization. The simulations using the optimal parameters are compared to the corresponding test set (without being regularized), by the computation of the root-mean-square error [49] , considering both the number of confirmed cases and dead individuals.All optimal parameters are calculated by combining the Differential Evolution [50] and the Nelder-Mead Simplex [51] methods. For each problem, the solution is estimated by Nelder-Mead Simplex and refined by Differential Evolution, which searches for the optimal parameters in the vicinity of the previously obtained point. The solution to each problem-the best individual in the population-is taken as an initial estimate for the next problem. Nelder-Mead Simplex runs with coefficients of reflection, expansion, contraction, and shrinkage equal to 1, 2, 0.5, and 0.5, respecitively. In turn, Differential Evolution runs with 20 individuals in the population, amplification factor equal to 0.6, and crossover probability equal to 0.95. The search space is bounded by 0 ≤ β ≤ 10 −6 , 0 ≤ ω ≤ 0.025, 0 ≤ d P ≤ 0.025, and 0 ≤ E (0) ≤ 10 4 in appropriate units (a. u.).Initially, the data used in this analysis is regularized using GPR as described in Section 2.4. The values of the hyperparameters tunned for the used kernel are indicated in Table 1 . Figure 3 shows an illustrative comparison between the original data for confirmed cases and dead individuals and the corresponding regularized data. In Fig. 3a , specific data are highlighted by the dashed vertical lines, identified by the letters A to F. Each of these lines has a dashed bounding box that represents the range of the zoom box with the corresponding letter. The behavior of the data in the highlighted points are discussed later. One may notice that regularized data show good agreement with the reported data, preserving the behavior of the curves over the entire interval, but smoothing out the noise-this statement is clear when looking at the zoom boxes in both figures. Next, the influence of estimating the parameters of the SEIRPD-Q model, presented in Section 2.1, using the regularized data set, in relation to the approach that adopts the original data is analyzed. Our focus is to analyze the gain related to the regularization of data within the scope of compartmental models and, therefore, we consider the simulations using the model adopted in this analysis. It is worth mentioning that the proposed analysis can be extended to any compartmental model. The analysis is performed by evaluating the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) between model predictions and test data.The implication of using regularized data is even more straightforward when we analyze the variability of simulations resulting from the set of parameters corresponding to each point in Fig. 4 . For this purpose, consider the results shown in Fig. 5 , which presents the simulations of confirmed cases, whose parameters are estimated by varying the amount of training data, as previously described. The simulations are represented by the gray curves (those that resulted in the extreme values are shown in black), and the training data set is shown in red. It is worth mentioning that the set of training data, even presenting variable size for each parameter estimation, is completely shown in both cases, in order to favor the comparison with the simulated results. Overall, 143 simulations are shown in each of the Figs. 5a and 5b, which cannot be distinguished from each other due to the proximity of the curves and the scale of the results. Comparing Figs. 5a and 5b, it is clear that simulations resulting from parameters estimated using data with no regularization have more variability than after regularization. Considering that on October 5, 2020 (last day of the simulation), Rio de Janeiro had 273338 confirmed cases, the extreme values (corresponding to the final values of the black curves) obtained in Fig. 5a are 77121 and 2365715, whereas in Fig. 5b the extreme values are in a narrower range, between 159454 and 1531221. The dispersion of these results can be alternatively analyzed using a box-andwhisker diagram, as shown in Fig. 6 . The boxes are bounded by the lower (first) and upper (third) quartiles of the full model prediction values, and the orange line represents the median. Whiskers, the vertical lines bounded by perpendicular dashes, extend from the minimum value of the data to the first quartile, and from the third quartile to the maximum value of the data. Whiskers express the variability outside these quartiles. In turn, the blue dashed line represents the experimental observed value of the cumulative number of infected individuals at the corresponding time.The inspection of Fig. 10c indicates that the mortality rate of positively diagnosed individuals basically only decreases after a certain run. This behavior suggests that the parameter can be approximated by a function. In this case, we propose to represent d P as a function of the formThis approach assumes an inherent error related to the first runs, at expense of better representing the parameter behavior in later times. Thus, d P becomes variable over time, and the vector of parameters to be estimated is formed by θ = (β, ω, d 0 , d 1 , E (0)). Following similar reasoning, one could argue that it would be possible to improve the descriptions of the other parameters. We chose to model only d P because it is the only parameter whose behavior showed a single inflection point, that can be approximated by a simple function in the analyzed interval. The description of the other parameters are likely to require higher order functions which would imply in estimating a greater number of parameters and even leading to non-identifiability issues.Consider the methodology previously adopted, where the set of training data is gradually expanded with each parameter estimation, but now taking into account the proposed approximation for d P (t) defined in Eq. (8) . The search intervals for the new parameters d 0 and d 1 are 0 ≤ d 0 ≤ 0.5 and 0 ≤ d 1 ≤ 0.5 (all other parameters follow the same specifications defined before). Figure 4 shows that this strategy is reflected in the reduction of the RMSE 14 .It is relevant to assess the influence of the proposed approaches for a larger test set. For that matter, consider the same methodology adopted to obtain the results of Fig. 4 , but now with the test set composed of the next 14 data following the last data of the training set. Thus, 136 sets of optimal parameters are calculated, whose respective simulations are compared to the test set of the corresponding run, and the deviation is computed by the RMSE. Figure 11 shows the results for original and regularized data, also considering constant and time-varying d P .As the training set gets larger, d P (t) starts to behave as expected, exponentially decreasing. In this scenario, the first calibrations provide functions relatively distant from the corresponding points in Fig. 13 , especially in the early times. In the last runs, the functions show good agreement with the compared points. However, it is important to note that d P (t) is not expected to represent the exact behavior of such data in the long run. In general, when the mortality rate varies over time, the compartmental model may be more capable of capturing the dynamics of the data, allowing for more accurate predictions. This hypothesis is supported by the last results obtained in Fig. 4 , where the orange dots always represent the best approximation in relation to the test data. Fig. 12 , in comparison to the results for constant d P (represented by the points) in Fig. 10c . The inserted color map associates the color of a curve with to the amount of data present in the training set used for calibration.Our study provides a framework that aims to increase the predictive capacity of compartmental models. This is relevant from the point of view that the proposed strategies can be extended to other data sets and compartmental models. Especially in the context of the epidemiological modeling of COVID-19, approaches of this type can be useful, taking into account the wide range of existing compartmental models and the fact that the data analyzed here are similar to others regarding noise.This study has gone some way towards enhancing our understanding of the influence of noise on the estimation of parameters of compartmental models. The work has revealed that the regularization of data by means of GPR can represent an alternative to mitigate the effect of noise in a given parameter calibration. Since this procedure must not be repeatedly applied, in the context to which it is proposed, the computational cost of the GPR can be considered irrelevant.Our research also suggests that it may be useful to use time-varying parameters, to the detriment of the usual approach that adopts constant parameters. It incorporates additional degrees of freedom into the model, in order to provide more flexibility to describe the behavior of the analyzed data. The choice of such a function depends on several factors, as for example the physical meaning of the parameter and the additional parameters inherent to the function. This analysis can be conducted for any model and, clearly, the gain is related to the appropriate choice of the function, especially if many parameters to be estimated are included.The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personnel relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.",Brazil,first author,2020-12-19,12

It has affected all regions of the world, and as of 23 rd November 2020, there have been 58,425,681 confirmed cases and 1,385,218 deaths, reported to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020) . It is transmitted by respiratory droplets, with an R0 of 2-3, and has a mean incubation time of five days (Meyerowitz et al., 2020) . Most cases (80%), when symptomatic, present with fever and upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract symptoms (Casas-Rojo et al., 2020; Richardson et al., 2020; Wu and McGoogan, 2020) , many of which with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions (Passali and Bentivoglio, 2020) . Most importantly, around 15% of patients present a severe form of disease, that evolves over 7 to 10 days with dyspnea, a respiratory rate of over 30/min, blood oxygen saturation less than 93%, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to inspired oxygen fraction ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates occupying over 50% within 24 to 48 hours; around 5% become critically ill, with respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction (Grasselli et al., 2020; Richardson et al., 2020; Wu and McGoogan, 2020) . This imposes a heavy burden on intensive care beds, even in highincome countries, as recognized early on (Grasselli et al., 2020) .Two main features are noticed in the severe form: intense systemic inflammation and hypercoagulability (Connors and Levy, 2020) . The expression ""cytokine storm"" has been proposed to depict this clinical situation (Mehta et al., 2020; Ruan et al., 2020) . A multicenter study in 150 severe COVID-19 cases showed that high levels of ferritin and IL-6 were associated to death (Ruan et al., 2020) . High C-reactive protein levels and ddimer were also related to disease severity (Mehta et al., 2020) .Therapeutic measures to address the systemic inflammatory syndrome depicted have been studied. So far, there is an established role for steroids. They have been used with success in the severe forms of pulmonary disease, with a significant impact on decreasing the need for invasive ventilation and death, and rapid improvement in PaO 2 /FiO 2 and a drop in CRP levels (Salton et al., 2020) . The benefit of using steroids has been proved by a randomized trial that was conducted with a total of 2,104 patients given dexamethasone 6 mg once per day for ten days and compared with 4,321 patients randomized to usual care alone (Horby et al., 2020) . Among the patients who received usual care alone, 28-day mortality was highest in those who required ventilation (41%), intermediate in those patients who required oxygen only (25%), and lowest among those who did not require any respiratory intervention (13%). Dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third in ventilated patients and by one fifth in other patients receiving oxygen only. However, there was no benefit among those patients who did not require respiratory support (Horby et al., 2020) .Tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds human interleukin-6 receptors, has a less clear role in severe COVID-19, as results from randomized trials reported to have failed to show mortality benefit at 28 or 30 days (Parr, 2020) .Since the beginning of the pandemic, a large number of studies have attempted to investigate the pathophysiology, clinical course and treatment options of COVID-19 (Aguilar et al., 2020; Petrilli et al., 2020; Psotka et al., 2020; Stratton et al., 2020) . endothelial cells are a common link between the invasion of the body by SARS-CoV-2 and pre-existing cardiometabolic diseases Tibirica and De Lorenzo, 2020a; Tibirica and De Lorenzo, 2020b) . In addition, patients diagnosed with moderate or severe COVID-19 present increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (Chen et al., 2020a) . Cytokine release syndrome (""cytokine storm""), which is characterized by a massive increase in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, is known to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Chen et al., 2020a) .Clinical studies on microcirculatory physiology have been performed for a long time, in the context of several conditions (Roustit and Cracowski, 2012) , and using different methods (Cracowski and Roustit, 2016) . Of note, the cutaneous microcirculation is an accessible and representative vascular bed that can be used for the evaluation of systemic microcirculatory flow and reactivity (Holowatz et al., 2008) .Laser Doppler perfusion monitoring (LDPM) is a noninvasive method for the evaluation of systemic microvascular endothelial function, and LDPM has already proven useful in many clinical conditions (Turner et al., 2008) , including cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (de Moraes et al., 2016; Gomes et al., 2008; Kaiser et al., 2013) , rheumatologic diseases (Ruaro et al., 2017; Weibel et al., 2007) and circulatory shock (either septic or cardiogenic) (Mongkolpun et al., 2020; Orbegozo et al., 2018) . Most published data concerning LDPM have validated the site of the skin of the forearm for the measurements, which is more accessible and more representative of general skin microvascular function (Cracowski and Roustit, 2016) . Systemic microvascular reactivity can be evaluated using LDPM combined with cutaneous local thermal hyperemia (LTH), as the vasodilatory response in the skin due to LTH represents, fundamentally, endothelium-dependent microvascular reactivity (Roustit and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Cracowski, 2012; Ugenti et al., 2018) . In fact, LTH induces a biphasic curve of cutaneous microvascular vasodilation; the initial peak (2-5 minutes) represents the local sensory nerve axon reflex (Roustit and Cracowski, 2013) , while the second peak (15 minutes) characterizes the release of endothelial vasodilators, predominantly nitric oxide (Roustit and Cracowski, 2013) . This methodology has already been used in the description of endothelial dysfunction and altered microvascular reactivity in different cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, including arterial hypertension (Rossi et al., 2008; Ullyot, 1990; Virdis and Taddei, 2011) type 1 diabetes (Sorelli et al., 2019) , hypercholesterolemia (Holowatz and Kenney, 2011; Holowatz et al., 2011) polycystic ovary syndrome and metabolic syndrome (Ketel et al., 2008) . Furthermore, LTH has been used as a clinical surrogate marker in various diseases, such as Raynaud's phenomenon and systemic sclerosis (Boignard et al., 2005; Roustit et al., 2008) . In the present study, maximal endothelium-dependent microvascular vasodilatation (44°C thermal plateau phase) was measured during the last five minutes of the second peak of microvascular flow resulting from LTH (a representative example of the recordings is presented in Figure 1 ).Given that the presence and intensity of systemic microvascular changes during the acute phase of COVID-19 may be related to disease progression and prognosis, the evaluation of microvascular reactivity in COVID-19 patients may offer relevant information. Thus, we used LDPM, which provides a noninvasive, simple and repeatable evaluation of tissue perfusion (Tibirica and De Lorenzo, 2020a) , combined with LTH, to compare the systemic microvascular flow and reactivity in patients with mild-to-moderate or severe COVID-19 with that in age-matched healthy volunteers who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. We also evaluated the plasma levels of different cytokines and chemokines with pro-or anti-inflammatory effects or with biologicalPatients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the National Institute of Cardiology, Ministry of Health, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were included after signing an informed consent form. A responsible family member signed the informed consent form when the patients were unable to sign it themselves. All the patients had underlying cardiac disease. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and was registered and made public at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT4406545).The patients had SARS-CoV-2, which was detected by RT-PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs, and met the criteria for hospitalization either due to their underlying condition or due to COVID-19 (Berlin et al., 2020; Wiersinga et al., 2020) .The demographic, clinical and laboratory data were recorded. The laboratory data included in this study were obtained within 24 h of the assessment of microvascular reactivity, and the serum cytokine levels were evaluated on the same day when LDPM was performed.Severe COVID-19 (S-COVID) was defined according to the WHO criteria, while all the other cases of COVID-19 were considered mild to moderate (M-COVID) (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-oncovid-19-final-report.pdf). Due to the very distinct characteristics and management (especially the need for vasoactive drugs), the groups were analyzed separately: patients without severe disease (M-COVID) and patients with severe disease (S-COVID).A group of healthy volunteers (without chronic diseases or cardiac risk factors) was recruited from hospital staff members who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. This group was also evaluated with LDPM and served as a control group. This group did not undergo cytokine assessment.The evaluation of the microvascular flow and reactivity was performed within one week after admission, during the acute phase of disease, using a single-point laser Doppler perfusion monitoring (LDPM) system (Periflux 5001, Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden) to noninvasively measure systemic microvascular perfusion changes (in arbitrary perfusion units [APU=10 mV]), as previously described (Cracowski and Roustit, 2016; Salgado et al., 2014) , using heating laser probes (PF 457, Perimed). The probes were attached to the skin with adhesive tapes, thus limiting movement artifacts.Moreover, patients were asked not to move during the recording period. After measuring the resting microvascular flow on the skin of the forearm for five minutes, the maximal microvascular vasodilatation was assessed using prolonged (20 minutes) local heating of the laser probe to 44°C (local thermal hyperemia, LTH, Figure 1 ), as previously described in detail (Salgado et al., 2014; Ugenti et al., 2018) . Maximal vasodilatation (44° C thermal plateau phase) corresponds to the mean microvascular flow during the last five minutes of the second peak. Data were digitized and stored on a computer and analyzed off-line with signal processing software (PeriSoft, Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden). We also compared the individual percentage increase of endotheliumdependent microvascular conductance ( Figure 2C ), to normalize the results to baseline values of microvascular flow, which is measure in arbitrary perfusion units.Blood samples were collected from a peripheral vein and stored on ice. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 800 g for 15 min at 4°C, aliquoted, and stored at -70°C until the day of analysis. A multiplex biometric immunoassay, using fluorescently dyed microspheres conjugated to monoclonal antibodies specific for a target protein, was The results are presented as the mean ± SD or median (25 th -75 th percentiles) for the parametric or nonparametric parameters, respectively, according to the Saphiro-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test. The cytokine and chemokine data were analyzed using the two-tailed unpaired Mann-Whitney test. Contingency tables were analyzed using chi-square tests. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.All the statistical analyses were performed using Prism, version 7.0 (GraphPad SoftwareInc. La Jolla, CA, USA).J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fThirty-two COVID-19 patients and 14 healthy volunteers were included. Table 1 depicts the demographic and clinical characteristics of these individuals. Twenty-four (75%) patients had mild-to-moderate disease and were managed in regular hospital beds, while 8 (25%) required admission to the ICU for mechanical ventilation and/or hemodynamic support. The mean age of the patients with M-COVID was 58.2 ± 14.1 years, and that of the patients with S-COVID was 65.6 ± 6.5 years; in these groups, 54%and 100% of the patients were male, respectively.Evaluation IL-1α is closely linked to the innate immune response and assists in host defense against infection (Dinarello, 2009) . Soluble IL-2Rα is found at high levels in the circulation of healthy individuals but is further increased in patients with infection, inflammation and autoimmune diseases (Damoiseaux, 2020) . Soluble IL-2Rα and IL-6 are significantly correlated with the severity of lung injury and the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. In addition, IL-6 is considered an independent predictor of adverse prognosis in COVID-19 patients (Chen et al., 2020b; Ruan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) .humans. Macrophage-derived IL-15 contributes with other monokines (especially IL-12) to the proinflammatory cascade leading to innate immune IFN-γ production (Fehniger and Caligiuri, 2001) .Interferons are essential in the response to viral infections, and the IFN-α response in SARS-CoV has been demonstrated in ferrets (Danesh et al., 2011) .MCP-1 were found to be elevated in COVID-19 patients who needed intensive care treatment (Liu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . -Santana et al., 2001) . MIP-1β is produced by human monocytes and dendritic cells upon different stimuli and is a chemoattractant for NK cells, recruiting them to inflammatory sites. NK cells have been associated with mild dengue (Azeredo et al., 2006) . In the study by Bozza et al. (Bozza et al., 2008) suggest that RANTES is involved in obliterative changes in the pulmonary arteries of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (Raucci et al., 2020) . In addition, studies have shown that RANTES inhibitors significantly decreased viremia in SARS-CoV-2 patients (Raucci et al., 2020) .CTACK is constitutively expressed in normal skin and is upregulated in wound sites. This chemokine is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid samples of HIV-1-positive patients and is correlated with nonneurological disorders (Kopf et al., 1996) . However, our study is the first to demonstrate the increase in the CTACK levels in patients with COVID-19. The significance of this finding has yet to be determined.The complexity of the cytokine/chemokine responses in COVID-19 patients is noteworthy. Huang et al (Huang et al., 2020) showed that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had high levels of IL1, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1, probably leading to activated T helper 1 (Th1) cell responses, and patients requiring ICU admission had higher concentrations of G-CSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1, and TNFα than those not requiring ICU admission, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity.However, COVID-19 patients also exhibited increased secretion of T helper 2 (Th2)cytokines (e.g., IL-4 and IL-10), which suppress inflammation. This observation is consistent with our results, as anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-5, which has a very narrow set of cellular targets, such as human eosinophils, basophils and a subset of mast cells, and, thus far, has not been described in COVID-19 patients (Kopf et al., 1996) and IL-10, which play a central role in limiting the host immune response to pathogens, thereby limiting damage to the host (Iyer and Cheng, 2012) , were increased (although not significantly in the case of IL-10) in patients with S-COVID. Further studies may elucidate the interplay between proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory mediators, as well as their vascular effects, in COVID-19 patients.Limitations to this study must be considered. The M-COVID and S-COVID groups are imbalanced for number, age and sex. This is due to the ""real-world"" nature of the study, which was performed with incoming patients amidst the COVID-19 pandemic; therefore, the differences reflect epidemiologic characteristics of the pandemic, such as the higher number of male patients with severe disease, as well as increased age in this subgroup.In conclusion, endothelium-dependent microvascular vasodilator responses J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The results are presented as the mean ± SD or the median (25 th -75 th percentile) for values that follow or do not follow a Gaussian distribution, respectively (Shapiro-Wilk normality test).

The parameters evaluated in the three groups of individuals (M-COVID, S-COVID and HEALTHY) were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. The values are expressed as the medians (25 th to 75 th percentiles) and were analyzed using the two-tailed unpaired Mann-Whitney test.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ",Brazil,first author,2020-12-03,12
bd3d66516939bc5736134cfdbec5cab116586784,Hyperinflammation and Neutrophil Extracellular Traps,"The World Health Organization (WHO) established the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 . Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a member of the coronavirus family, a class of enveloped viruses with a positive-sense singlestranded RNA genome. This virus can cross species barriers and induce illnesses ranging from the usual cold to severe interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure, and septic shock [1] . While there is a global effort in the development of vaccines and improvement of diagnostic methods [2, 3] and therapies that relieve the symptoms and prognosis of COVID-19 patients under severe infection [4] , there remain gaps in our understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 related to innate immunity.In a scenario where patients with severe COVID-19 could develop dysfunction of the immune response that aggravates the hyperinflammation [5, 6] , it is hypothesized that neutrophils can amplify pathological damage or control other cell subsets depending on the infection features. Therefore, to use the potential of NETs with minimal damage to the hosts, there must be a right balance of NET formation and reduction of the amount of NETs that accumulate in tissues [7] .Notwithstanding the rapid progress in the field, there are many critical unknown features of neutrophils in fighting viral infections. We highlighted the current progress in the pathways of neutrophilic inflammation in viral infection, with a focus on the release of NETs and its influence on lung disease. The knowledge summarized in this study should benefit researchers in integrating neutrophil biology to design new and more efficient virus-targeted interventions concerning COVID-19.storm"") that might lead to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [6, 9] .Cytokines play a relevant function in immunopathology during virus infections. The host-viral interactions are established via host identification of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of the virus [10] . This identification occurs through host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) manifested on innate immune cells (e.g., neutrophils, dendritic cells, epithelial cells, and macrophages) [11] , and the recognition of PAMPs and viral danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by conserved PRRs marks the first line of defense against pathogens, involving toll-like receptors (TLRs) [11] .TLR stimulation activates the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling cascade, causing the production of inflammatory markers from monocytes (interleukin-(IL-) 1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and IL-6) to control virus infections [8] by direct antiviral pathways and the recruitment of other leukocytes [10] . Moreover, the exacerbated oxidative stress induced by elevated concentrations of cytokines, along with reduced concentrations of interferon α and interferon β (IFN-α, IFN-β), influences the severity of COVID-19 [12] .Several mediators control the release of chemoattractants and neutrophil activity [10] , and studies have demonstrated that higher values of proinflammatory markers are related to extensive lung damage and pulmonary inflammation in MERS-CoV [13] and ARDS infection [14] . COVID-19 in the severe state exhibits a cytokine storm with elevated plasma levels of chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), IFNγ, IFNγinducible protein 10, G-CSF, chemokine C-C motif ligand 3 (CCL3), IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, and TNF-α [12, 15] . Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-(NOD-) like receptor and increased plasma levels of chemokines and cytokines in COVID-19 patients relate to the severity of the disease rather than did those nonsevere patients [5] . In this sense, Huang et al. [15] found that patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 infection had higher plasma levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, interferon-inducible protein 10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, CCL2, CCL3, and TNF-α when compared with non-ICU patients [15] .Neutrophils are innate immune cells with a brief lifespan after leaving the bone marrow and exist in a quiescent, primed, or active state. These leukocytes are the leading players in innate immunity since they are among the first innate leukocytes recruited during infections [16] . The primary function of neutrophil is clearance of pathogens and debris through phagocytosis [17] . They also have a distinct array of other immune roles, such as the liberation of NETs for viral infection inactivation [18] and cytokine production to restrict virus replication [16] .The release of neutrophil-chemoattractive elements and the resulting recruitment of neutrophils are a global host response to viral infection [19] . In this scenario, the neutrophil cell membrane also expresses a complex array of receptors and adhesion molecules for various ligands, including immunoglobulins, membrane molecules on other cells, and cytokines [20] .In addition to the trafficking to infection places to phagocytize viruses, the neutrophils can initiate, enlarge, and/or repress adaptive immune effector processes by promoting bidirectional cross-talk with T cells [21, 22] . Following the acute inflammation arising from immunological processes, such as viral infections, neutrophils with decreased expression of CD62L weaken T cell migration via the CXCL11 chemokine gradient by releasing H 2 O 2 into an immunological synapse [23] . Thus, neutrophils that uncovered viral antigens can home to draining lymph nodes, acting as antigenpresenting cells (APC) [24] . Hufford et al. [25] evidenced that neutrophils expressing viral antigen as an outcome of direct infection by influenza A virus (IAV) display the most potent APC activity and that viral antigen-presenting neutrophils infiltrating the IAV-infected lungs act as APC for effector CD8(+) T lymphocytes in the infected lungs [25] . Neutrophils recruit the T cell molecular mechanism during the influenza virus infection and associate to CXCL12 reservoirs left behind. CD8+ T cells follow the chemoattractant trail left behind by neutrophil uropods to the influenza virus infection site [26] .Decreased cell number or impaired leukocyte function can play a part in advance of mild to severe clinical disease conditions [16] . Regarding the new coronavirus, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a well-known marker of infection and systemic inflammation, has evidenced an enhanced inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients [5] . Since the ARDS is the primary cause of mortality in patients with COVID-19, the elevated NLR values suggest a poor prognosis in COVID-19 disease [27] , especially severe COVID-19 compared to mild patients. Sun et al. [28] studied 116 patients with COVID-19 and showed a higher NLR [28] . The authors compared severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU with others or severe patients not admitted to the ICU. They reported that COVID-19 patients have the lowest count of lymphocytes and the highest neutrophil count and NLR [28] . Wang et al. [29] also showed that several COVID-19 patients have a rising neutrophil count and a falling lymphocyte count during the severe phase [29] . Similarly, Barnes et al. [30] found extensive neutrophil infiltration in pulmonary capillaries from a COVID-19 patient [30] . Nevertheless, even though severe cases of COVID-19 appear to be related to increased NLR levels [5] , whether NLR could be an independent predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients still requires investigation.Neutrophils can develop a sophisticated network of DNA called NETs through NETosis, a liberation of web-like structures of nucleic acids wrapped with histones that detain viral particles [31] . Upon discovery, the researchers believed that the production of NETs defended only against fungi and bacteria [32] . However, the NETosis process plays an important function in the response to viral diseases [33] , thereby 2 Mediators of Inflammation protecting the host during the virus response by trapping and eliminating distinct pathogens [31] . The formation of NETs is a controlled process, even though the related signals remain unknown. NETosis is conditional on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase) [34] . There is evidence of NETosis produced in a ROS-independent mechanism [35] . In general, the NETosis process includes the release of nuclear chromatin lined with effector proteins and peptidyl arginine deiminase type IV (PAD4) activation [36] . After stimulation, the neutrophil nuclear envelope disintegrates to enable the mixing of chromatin with granular proteins [37] . Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neutrophil elastase (NE) stimulate chromatin condensation and deteriorate histones [38] . In the presence of histone hypercitrullination, PAD4 mediates chromatin decondensation, and the DNA-protein complexes are released extracellularly as NETs [37] . Therefore, differently from apoptosis or necrosis, both the granular membrane and nuclear membrane deteriorate during NETosis, whereas plasma membrane integrity remains [36] .The overproduction of NETs induces lung tissue damage by NETosis-related enzymes such as NE and MPO [39] . Uncontrolled NET production correlates with disease gravity and lung injury extension. For instance, NETosis markers are related to bacterial burden and local inflammation in the lung [40] and patients with pneumonia-associated ARDS have neutrophils in a ""primed"" condition to generate NETs [41] .During chronic obstructive pulmonary disease aggravation, the production of NETs increases in people with acute respiratory failure [39] and in ARDS patients [40, 42] . The elevated NET production, as noted in patients with severe IAV infection [43] , increased injury to the pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells [44] , directing to severe pneumonia. Zhu et al. [43] also noted that the production of NETs positively correlates with multiple organ dysfunction syndromes [43] .The inflammatory process is a trigger for thrombotic complications usually noted in COVID-19 patients, and the immunothrombotic dysregulation seems to be an important key marker for the disease severity [45] . Skendros et al. [46] found that complement activation potentiates the platelet/-NET/tissue factor/thrombin axis during SARS-CoV-2 infection [46] . In contrast, Nicolai et al. [47] noted that, in COVID-19, inflammatory microvascular thrombi are found in the kidney, lung, and heart, containing NETs related to the fibrin and platelets. In blood, Nicolai et al. also show that COVID-19 patients have neutrophil-platelet aggregates and a different platelet and neutrophil activation pattern, which alters with the disease severity [47] . Middleton et al. [48] also found that plasma MPO-DNA complexes increased in COVID-19 and that the elevated NET formation correlates with COVID-19-related ARDS. Together, these findings suggest the timely application of therapeutic strategies that can disrupt the vicious cycle of COVID-19 immunothrombosis/thromboinflammation by targeting neutrophil activation and NET formation.In addition to the physical containment promoted by NETosis [33] , NETs contain DNA, modified extracellular histones, proteases, and cytotoxic enzymes that allow neutrophils to centralize lethal proteins at infection sites [7] . The mechanisms of NETs' release in the viral response seem to 3 Mediators of Inflammation involve neutrophil NE production attributed to the change of macrophage role by the cleavage of TLRs [49] . A range of stimuli, including toxic factors, viruses, and proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-8, can lead neutrophils to release NETs [7, 33] . Mechanisms that determine strain specificity to induce NETosis formation during viral infection are still unknown.Lung inflammation is the leading cause of the lifethreatening respiratory complication at the severe levels of COVID-19 [50] . Veras et al. [51] investigated the potentially detrimental function of NETs in the pathophysiology of 32 hospitalized severe COVID-19 patients and found that the levels of NETs increase in tracheal aspirate and plasma from patients with COVID-19 and their neutrophils naturally produced more significant concentrations of NETs [51] . The authors also reported NETs in the lung tissue specimens from autopsies of COVID-19 patients. In vitro, they noted that viable SARS-CoV-2 cause NET production by healthy neutrophils through a PAD-4-dependent manner and that NETs produced by SARS-CoV-2-activated neutrophils instigated lung epithelial cell death [51] . Zuo et al. [52] also investigated sera from COVID-19 patients and found higher cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA (MPO-DNA), and citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3) [52] . In vitro, they also noted that sera from COVID-19 patients trigger NET release from control neutrophils [52] .Although the literature does not report direct evidence linking NETs and SARS-CoV2 clearance, virus entrapping by NETs was already found in syncytial respiratory virus infection [53] or influenza [54] . Furthermore, in virus infection, NETs are efficient to block viruses at the infection site, entrapping them in a DNA web [22] . Therefore, the NETosis process induced by the virus could operate as a double-edged sword: on the one hand, there are essential and efficient mechanisms for trapping the virus [55] , and on the other, there are highly intense immunological and inflammatory processes triggered by NET release causing damage to the organism [7] . These interactions could influence the COVID-19 symptoms in the relationship between hyperinflammation (overproduction of NETs and cytokine storm) and the function of neutrophils to destroy the viral infection ( Figure 1 ).The exacerbated NET formation can drive to a cascade of inflammatory reactions that destroys surrounding tissues, favors microthrombosis, contributes to the progress of cancer cell metastasis, and results in permanent damage to the pulmonary, cardiovascular, and renal systems [56] . Whether by coincidence or a cause-and-effect relationship, these organs are affected in the severe state of the COVID-19 Mediators of Inflammation disease [57, 58] . The uncontrolled and poorly acknowledged host response regarding the cytokine storm is one of the major causes of severe COVID-19 conditions [12] . In this pandemic scenario, there is a compelling need to investigate the mechanisms associated with hyperinflammation process and NET production in response to COVID-19. The NLR is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 [27] , and neutrophilia forecasts poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients [29] . In this sense, new frontiers in NET assessment regarding COVID-19 may be expressed by analyzing NETosis directly after sputum induction or after bronchoscopy using the bronchial alveolar fluid of COVID-19 patients [42] . Since patient samples usually become accessible at the hospital, it could investigate whether the existence of NETs is associated with the severity of COVID-19.Treatments using NET-targeting approaches, although would not directly target the new coronavirus, could reduce the damage caused by hyperinflammation [59] , thereby decreasing the disease's severity and avoiding invasive mechanical ventilation, consequently diminishing mortality. Drugs that target NETs include inhibitors of the molecules necessary for NET formation, such as gasdermin D [60] , PAD4 [61] , and NE [62] . Studies on treatment of inflammatory state in COVID-19 patients with NET inhibitors are still in development (please see Table 1 ).Caution is needed to define which people would advantage from suppressing the neutrophil response and which would help more from a strengthened neutrophil action during viral infections. Despite prior studies linking pulmonary diseases to aberrant NET formation [ 3, 4 ] , our understanding of NETosis mechanisms in viral infection is still limited.The hyperinflammation is related to the severity of COVID-19 by influencing the pulmonary inflammation [12] . Neutrophils exhibit an intense response to virus infection, promoting bidirectional cross-talk with T cells [21] . Neutrophils also express a complex array of receptors and adhesion molecules for various ligands, including immunoglobulins and inflammatory markers [20] . In this sense, severe cases of COVID-19 appear to be related to increased NLR levels [5] , and treatments using NET-targeting approaches have the potential to decrease the damage caused by hyperinflammation [40, 41] . The researchers should consider hyperinflammation in the different phases of COVID-19, neutrophil response mechanisms, and NETosis.The data supporting this narrative review are from previously reported studies and datasets, which have been cited.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.",Brazil,first author,2020-12-02,12
5e1f940dacdbecc49aea196a3fd065e1b3fb99ca,"Journal Pre-proof The COVID-19 pandemics and the relevance of biosafety facilities for metagenomics surveillance, structured disease prevention and control The COVID-19 pandemics and the relevance of biosafety facilities for metagenomics surveillance, structured disease prevention and control","The preexisting healthcare infrastructure and research networks in a country are important assets to mounting an effective response against an emerging health threat. In poorer nations, where these components are less developed, the response to an epidemic has been primarily driven by outside experts who can often be severely constrained by local customs and societal norms [1] . These difficulties become more apparent when the manipulation of the underlying pathogenic agent requires higher biosafety levels for its containment.A comparison of the responses in two countries to two viral epidemics of different biosafety levels can expose important considerations for future events. The emergence and spread of the Ebola virus, which requires containment in biosafety level (BSL)-4 facilities, occurred in some of the poorest countries of West Africa where no appropriate facilities existed to deal with such agent. The response, therefore, had to be led and organized from abroad [2] . In contrast, the response to the Zika virus was coordinated internally within the affected countries. The virus emerged in 2015 as a BSL-2 pathogen and spread rapidly throughout Latin America, which is home to a number of Innovative Developing Countries (IDCs) including Brazil [3] . The previous decades of scientific investments for research on other arboviruses, at both the federal and state levels of the IDCs, provided the necessary infrastructure for national researchers and institutions to deliver the science needed to develop an effective public health response [1] [4] .The formidable threat of the ongoing pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has exposed the numerous challenges to combat emerging pathogens for not only poor countries, but the whole global community. We call attention to the disruptive challenge posed by the requirement for BSL-3 level facilities to conduct fundamental research on the causative agent, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has represented a major, critical bottleneck in the fight against the impact of COVID-19. Even in countries and institutions where such facilities exist, their high demand to perform studies on SARS-CoV-2 has become nearly impossible to satisfy. For example, based at pubmed.gov entries of published articles on coronaviruses, in one year 4-times more studies were done than since 1949. For animal experimentation, appropriate BSL-3 platforms are even more rare. In Brazil, for instance, the laboratories that excelled at generating relevant and important knowledge during epidemics of Zika, dengue and Chikungunya have had to face long waiting lines to access BLS-3 facilities in their own or collaborating institutions [5] [6] (preprints: [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] ). Ultimately, this has had the effect of concentrating the ability to advance the preclinical development of vaccines and antivirals to the richest countries.Fortunately, the two highly pathogenic coronaviruses that emerged before SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), were controlled before they could spread. In contrast, the infection characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in combination with increased travel patterns allowed it to spread worldwide quickly. Once again, immunologically naive human populations were exposed to a viral spillover [12] . The world was completely unprepared, from a health perspective to social and economic perspectives, to deal with what would become the most serious sanitary threat of present times. COVID-19 shined a glaring light onto an old dilemma: spending on disease prediction/prevention [13] [14] [15] or focusing on surveillance [16] ? This never-ending discussion needs to be resolved based on the clear evidence of the potential economic toll caused by epidemics, which should convince everyone irrespective of their fiscal philosophy that investing in both approaches is not only a good health policy but also sound economics.The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China is a good example of prediction: it could be detected and characterized in record time due to previous work on bat coronavirus [17] which has continued uninterruptedly as a part of the PREDICT funding programme [18] and the Global Virome Project [13] .An example of the need to improve surveillance comes from our demonstration that Zika and Chikungunya circulated during a year in Rio de Janeiro before being detected [19] [20] .This observation points to a much-needed change in disease prevention and control: the need to invest in syndromic, metagenomic surveillance and not only on the diagnostics of specific diseases. The complete sequencing of suspected COVID-19 clinical samples has shown the usefulness of this approach as it has detected additional concomitant viral genomes that could possibly be involved in the clinical response of a patient (unpublished). In addition to qualified laboratories, BSL-3 animal facilities are another absolute requirement to perform the research necessary to generate new knowledge on highly pathogenic (re)emerging infectious disease. The development of interventions also strictly relies on animal models to fulfill the requirements of pre-clinical development of antivirals and vaccines. Many industrialized countries give high priority to these J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f platforms, realizing that their investments have a potential to not only deliver needed health solutions, but also can provide a range of economic gains from start-ups to licensing new technologies. This potential for economic development benefits could help justify the costs of building and operating a BSL-3 animal facility, which has limited its available in developing countries. For instance, Brazil has no BSL-3 animal facility under the coordination of the BRA-MoH. This has led to a tough lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic as there is limited access in developing countries to critical lifesaving supplies due to their dependence on imported medicines, which can be related to an absence of the necessary infrastructure for ""in-house development"". An example is the antiviral remdesivir that was developed by an American company and is mostly unavailable since its promising pre-clinical results led to the US government purchasing almost the entire global supply of this drug.Innovative developing countries would be more independent and could be able to respond to future epidemics if biosafety laboratories, particularly BSL-3 units, were integrated into a coordinated system that allows for the execution of the most complete scientific response. This would pave the way for the rapid preclinical development of vaccines and antivirals to emerging threats. This subject becomes of higher interest when we take into consideration that in tropical countries, many of the disease outbreaks may not capture the attention of pharmaceutical industry due to the low financial return. The chikungunya virus is a good example: after almost a decade since its re-emergence in the developing world, no vaccine or specific treatment has been approved. In Brazil, scientists were only able to complete studies on drug repurposing for chikungunya when the virus was downgraded to a BSL-2 pathogen, which was actually a response to the fact that its circulation had become endemic. It is unlikely that any of the highly pathogenic aerosol-generating viruses, such as Influenza A(H5N1) virus and SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and Ebola virus, will have their biosafety level downgraded -reinforcing the necessity of BSL-3 facilities. The downgrading of the biosafety level of a pathogen is often unequivocal evidence of its autochthonous circulation.The initial risk classification of a given pathogen and its revision is critical to integrate BSL-3 facilities into the public health response to an unfolding epidemic/pandemic. For example, when the Zika virus started to circulate in the Americas, the original perception of it being a self-limited disease, along with a previous history of endemic circulation of flaviviruses, made this virus a BSL-2 pathogen. Conversely, Zika virus was contrasted by the observation that a viral infection in pregnant women increased the incidence of microcephaly in newborns. Thus, in countries where Flaviviruses are not endemic, the vector is exotic or the population is immunologically naïve to Zika virus, higher biosafety requirement is prudent. In fact, the causative relationship between Zika virus and teratogenesis highlight that Koch's postulates are still contemporary. Thus, the causative relationship between a microorganism and disease should be established, on the bases of laboratory experimentation, which may require high biosafety level facilities.Over the past decades, genome sequencing has become much more accessible and the tools to perform metagenomic-and metatranscriptomic-based surveillance more J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f feasible. In the future, newly identified genomes will need to be associated with emerging disease. Normally, finding the nucleic acid of a microbe in a clinical sample is not sufficient to implicate it in disease. For diseases that are minimally reproduced in animal models or complex culture systems, isolated microorganism must be tested for their ability to cause disease in BLS-3 facilities as an integral part of public health systems. If a pathogen is fastidious and cannot be cultured, researchers may entail to identify epidemiologically linked individuals with a similar course of illness, within a certain period of time, as an alternative to satisfy Koch's postulates. The necessity to verify whether or not an emerging pathogen can be cultured stipulates the necessity to use biocontainment at a level of 3 or above and is even more critical in scenarios short to fulfill Koch's postulates.Finally, the COVID-19 pandemics reinforces the necessity for both cellular and animal BSL-3 laboratories as a fundamental part of the public health response to quickly identify potentially harmful microorganisms and to develop medical interventions.",Brazil,abstract,2020-12-01,12
cbb18c2e25d4ce87415063c31809b9f28007b96c,"Coronavirus disease-19 deaths among children and adolescents in an area of Northeast, Brazil: why so many?","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disproportionally affects adults, and older individuals have a high risk of severe disease and death [1] . Children and adolescents in turn account for a minority of cases and have more favourable disease outcomes, even those who have comorbidities [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] By September 2020, Brazil had 4.3 million COVID-19 cases and 135 000 deaths, and 821 deaths of children and adolescents after the start of the pandemic [7] However, children's deaths are not evenly distributed. Sao Paulo, the most populous and developed Brazilian state, reported a rate of 0.81 deaths per 100 000 people under 19 years old [8] , while Sergipe, the smallest Brazilian state, reported 4.87/100 000 [9] Such differences motivate us to study and describe the burden of COVID-19 deaths in children and adolescents in Sergipe State, to identify possible reasons for the high proportion of deaths.This was an ecological study of all reported COVID-19 cases and confirmed deaths of children and adolescents younger than 19 years in Sergipe. All deaths were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 cases reported by the state are diagnosed based on clinical presentation, radiology, serology or RT-PCR, depending on the severity of clinical presentation and the place of consultation. [11] Data on COVID-19 cases and deaths were obtained from the Sergipe Health Surveillance [9] and mortality information systems [12] The characteristics of the children (sex, age, place of death, comorbidities, time from symptoms onset to hospitalisation and death) were obtained from the hospital records. Population data stratified by age were obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics [10] The characteristics of the children were summarised using descriptive statistics, and we calculated both the number of deaths per 100 000 population and the case fatality rates (CFRs) by age group. COVID-19 CFR was calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of COVID-19 cases. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Sergipe (approval number 36778320.0.0000.5546).Sergipe reported 6038 COVID-19 cases among children under 19 years of age until 30 September 2020, of whom 37 died, resulting in a CFR of 0.61%. Sergipe has a population of 759 907 children under 19, and thus, the state had 4.87 deaths per 100 000 paediatric population. The highest proportion of deaths was reported in infants (n = 15): 44.1 deaths per 100 000 infants < 12 months with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 15.3%. Of older children, fewer died, and their CFR was lower, as shown in Table 1 .The characteristics of all deaths in children and adolescents are shown in Table 2 . Among the 15 (41%) deaths of infants, five were neonates. Thirty-five (95%) of the 37 deaths occurred in SUS hospitals. The median time from symptom onset to admission to hospital was 3 days (interquartile range (IQR): 0-5). There was no difference between the time of symptom onset and admission to hospital between age groups (P = 0.704, from Kruskal-Wallis test). Four children admitted to hospital without COVID-19 (cardiac disease, neoplasia and chronic neurologic disease) became symptomatic after admission. Nine (24%) children died within 24 hours of admission; the median time to death was 6 days (IQR: 1-13) after admission. There was no difference between the time of admission to hospital and death between age groups (P = 0.464, from Kruskal-Wallis test). Twenty-five (68%) of the children had underlying comorbidities such as chronic neurological diseases (n = 7; 19%) and prematurity (n = 4; 11%). Fourteen (38%) of the children who died were admitted to ICU.We report an unusually high death rate and case fatality rate among children in Sergipe. Most of these children were infants and had a rapid progression to death after hospital admission. Most children had underlying comorbidities, and a small proportion of them were admitted to an ICU.The COVID-19 mortality rate in children under 19 years old in Sergipe is 37 times higher than that reported from the United States and the UK (0.13 deaths per 100 000 population under 19 years old for both) and 3.7 times higher than in other areas of Brazil (1.3 deaths per 100 000 population under 19 years old) [8, 13, 14] UNICEF reported scarce data on mortality among children and adolescents from low-and middle-income countries due to the later emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in these settings and lack of resources to conduct epidemiological and clinical studies [15] However, differences in fatality rates from COVID-19 by age between low-, middle-and high-income countries are predicted [16] Although Sergipe State has an adequate number of adult ICU beds and deployed a further 88 adults' ICU beds since the start of the pandemic, Sergipe has a 41% deficit in paediatric ICU beds [11, 17] , with only seven in its neonatal ICU, and no additional paediatric ICU beds deployed during the epidemic [9] Moreover, none of the paediatric ICU beds are ring-fenced for COVID-19 and children often experience long waiting times before ICU admission. Another Brazilian study during the pandemic also described similar difficulties accessing ICU beds for pregnant women [18] Seven of the deaths occurred in neonates and infants with neonatal-related problems. The large proportion of deaths among children with comorbidities has been reported elsewhere; especially, neonates are at greater risk of severe illness and death than older children [19, 20] Neonates are more susceptible to infectious diseases and are more likely to present health complications such as prematurity, perinatal asphyxia and maternal infections, which lead to high fatality rates.One study has described the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic in the health services available for neonates in low-and middle-income countries [21] Sergipe has historically had high mortality rates among its neonates [12] COVID-19-related deaths in Sergipe may have highlighted these discrepancies in the Brazilian SUS, especially for services such as maternal and neonatal care that have a history of inadequate supplies and services [22, 23] The role of comorbidities in severe COVID-19 has been reported less frequently in children than in adults. In Europe, COVID-19 deaths occur less frequently in children, even among those who are immunocompromised [24] . Other studies have reported a large number of previously healthy children with severe COVID-19 [4] [5] [6] In Sergipe, almost 70% of children's deaths were associated with comorbidities, some of which require lengthy hospitalisation that may have facilitated nosocomial transmission. Nine children died within 24 h of hospital admission, reflecting delays on health seeking and severe presentation at the time of admission to hospital. This study has several limitations. The data were not collected prospectively and based on epidemiological surveillance and hospital records. Overall, there is significant under-reporting of COVID-19 cases in Sergipe State and Brazil, and therefore, our information is likely to represent merely the most severe forms of the disease. Sergipe and Brazil have the same availability of tests, as most of them are provided by the Ministry of Health, with a smaller proportion of tests being purchased by the State Government. This would increase the CFR, but this occurs for most states, Sergipe included. However, it would not change the number of deaths/ age-specific population that we found. The death rate by population is unbiased, as the denominator comes from the last official census.Conclusion COVID-19 deaths by population and the case fatality ratio in children and adolescents in Sergipe are higher than in other Brazilian states and elsewhere, especially among infants. Although most of the children had underlying health conditions, the proportion of children admitted to ICU was small and reflects insufficient paediatric ICU capacity in Sergipe State. Neonates and infants are a risk group that should have priority in public health policy and ICU services.",Brazil,abstract,2020-12-06,12
c2b2dc617924e3adfee2f76f17075c5a2e167a6f,Acute Kidney Injury and Renal Replacement Therapy in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: Risk Factors and Outcomes: A Single-Center Experience in Brazil Keywords COVID-19 · Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 · Acute kidney injury · Dialysis · Intensive care unit · Continuous renal replacement therapy,"The first case of COVID-19 in Brazil was confirmed on February 26, 2020, and 6 months later, Brazil had more than 3,500,000 diagnosed cases and was the country with the second highest number of cases worldwide [1] . The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic disease to respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [2] , resulting in a large number of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions [3, 4] . Previous studies have shown that about 5% of all cases and up to 30% of hospitalized patients require ICU admission [5, 6] .Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical problem in critically ill patients, especially in those with acute lung injury receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) [7, 8] . Initial data showed a variable incidence of AKI in COVID-19 patients, ranging from 0.5 to 23% [2, 9] , but more recent reports have shown even higher incidences, with rates of up to 36%, and need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) in 5.2% of patients [3, 10] . The development of AKI was associated with worse outcomes [2, 9, 11, 12] . The aim of our study was to describe the incidence, risk factors, and impact of AKI and RRT on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU.We included adult patients (≥18 years old) with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection admitted to the ICU of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein (HIAE), a private quaternary teaching hospital in Brazil, between March 04 and May 13, 2020. A laboratory-confirmed case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was defined by a positive RT-PCR assay for a specimen collected via nasopharyngeal swab. Patients with CKD on dialysis were excluded from the study.Demographic and clinical variables included age, sex, chronic medical conditions, regular medications, reason for ICU admission, date of onset of symptoms, and drugs prescribed during hospitalization. Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (SAPS3), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (SOFA), and Charlson Comorbidity Index were recorded on the first day of ICU. We also collected data on IMV, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, vasopressors, and RRT requirement. Laboratory results were gathered at ICU admission.Baseline Cr was defined as the average of all values observed between 8 and 365 days prior to hospitalization [13] . In the absence of previous serum Cr records, the lowest Cr level during hospitalization was considered [14] . The estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration Cr equation [15] . AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria [14] .Individuals were initially treated according to the institutional protocol (appendix). Timing of dialysis initiation and the choice of modality were at the discretion of the nephrology team. Regularly at our center, critically ill patients with AKI are initiated on continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) at a prescribed dose of 30-35 mL/kg/h of effluent and with regional citrate anticoagulation [16] . The Prismaflex AN69 ST150 set was used with the Prismaflex control unit (Baxter, IL, USA) to perform CVVHDF. We evaluated the delivered dialysis dose, the filtration fraction, and the fluid balance during the first 7 days of therapy. We assessed the filter life span, and the reasons for changing the dialysis set throughout the CRRT time. The local Ethics Committee reviewed and approved this study (CAAE 30525320.0.0000.0071). All patients were unable to provide consent themselves, so consent was gained using the appropriate emergency consent mechanisms.The primary outcome was 60-day mortality after ICU admission. After hospital discharge, the follow-up was made either by accessing the medical records or by telephone contact. The same strategy was applied to 28-day mortality. For all other secondary outcomes, follow-up was made until May 23, 2020 which included the following: Cr at hospital discharge, ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, and dependence on RRT at hospital discharge.A convenience sample was considered for this analysis, with consecutive patients included until the latest follow-up. There were no missing data for any of the outcomes. Continuous variables are presented as medians (quartile 25%-quartile 75%) and categorical variables as number and percentages. Patients were divided in groups according to development of AKI (AKI vs. non-AKI) and treatment with RRT (RRT vs. non-RRT) until the latest follow-up.Baseline and clinical characteristics of the patients were compared among the groups using Fisher exact tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Time until ICU and hospital discharge is presented as Kaplan-Meier plots. The association of AKI or RRT with ICU and hospital mortality was reported as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval from generalized linear modelling with binomial distribution. The association with ICU and hospital length of stay was assessed using the subdistribution hazard ratio derived from a Fine-Gray competing risk model with death before the event treated as competing risk. The association of Cr with hospital discharge and duration of ventilation in survivors was assessed as the median difference from a quantile regression with Τ = 0.50 and results estimated with bootstrap with 1,000 resamples. To account for potential confounders, additional analyses adjusted by SAPS3 and Charlson Comorbidity Index were performed. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify factors independently associated with development of AKI and need of RRT. A list of candidate baseline predictors was determined a priori and included only variables with a known or suspected relationship with outcome. The multivariable model was constructed considering variables with a p < 0.05 in the univariable analysis and confirmed using a backward elimination technique and the leaps algorithm to perform a best subset selection including exhaustive search based on the Bayesian information criteria Blood Purif DOI: 10.1159/000513425 before undergoing a final assessment for clinical and biological plausibility. Missingness among continuous predictors was present in less than 5% of the patients; thus, these values were imputed using the median value. Subsequent sensitivity to missingness was performed using multiple imputations. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyze the effect of AKI and RRT on 28and 60-day mortality. Time from ICU admission until death at 28-and 60-day was presented as Kaplan-Meier plots. All analyses were conducted in R v.3.6.3 (R Foundation) [17] , and significance level was set at 0.05.A total of 207 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU were evaluated. Six patients on chronic hemodialysis were excluded. Of the remaining 201 patients, 123 (61%) were males with a median age of 64 years (IQR, 52-80) Table 1 .Baseline Cr was available prior to admission in 103 patients (52%). Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate Step-down unit 15 (7.5) 9 (8.9) 6 (6.0) 4 (11.8) 11 (6.6) Other hospital 13 (6.5) 7 (6.9) 6 (6.0) 5 (14. Table 2 .AKI was diagnosed in 50.2% (n = 101) of all patients, and the median age was 73 years (IQR, 56.0-84.0). Fortythree (42.6%) patients were stratified as stage 1; 19 (18.8%), stage 2; and 39 (38.6%), stage 3 AKI. Their processes of care are shown in Table 3 .After adjustment in a multivariable analysis, the development of AKI was independently associated with diuretic use, IMV, and higher baseline Cr (Table 4 ; online suppl. Tables 1-3; for all online suppl. material, see www. karger.com/doi/10.1159/000513425). AKI was developed in 80% (70/87) of the patients who required IMV. The median time between the beginning of IMV and the diagnosis of AKI was 1 day (IQR, 0-1). Seventy-two percent of patients were diagnosed with AKI during the first day of IMV.Among survivors, patients with AKI remained on IMV longer (10.5 [6.5-16.8] vs. 6 [6-9] days; p < 0.001). The clinical outcomes according to the development of AKI are shown in Table 5 . In online suppl. Figures 1 and  2 , time until hospital and ICU discharge are presented as Kaplan-Meier curves, respectively.Thirty-four percent of the 101 AKI patients received RRT. After adjustment on multivariable analysis, higher C-reactive protein (CRP) and baseline Cr were associated with RRT requirement (Table 6 ; online suppl. Tables [4] [5] [6] . CVVHDF was the initial modality used in 97% of patients, who remained on RRT for a median of 15 days (IQR 10-24) during ICU stay ( Table 3 ). The delivered dialysis dose of CVVHDF and the filtration fraction during the first 7 days of therapy were 36.7 mL/kg/h (32.2-37.9) and 21.7% (18.8-23.1), respectively. A simple analysis showed no significant difference in the delivered dialysis dose between the survivors and those who died All patients receiving RRT were on IMV. Additional clinical outcomes according to the use of RRT are shown in Table 5 . Figure 1 shows the time from onset of symptoms to AKI and RRT.

Figure 2 and online suppl. Figure 3 . The main causes of death were respiratory failure 51.7% (n = 15), shock 17.2% (n = 5), cardiovascular disease 17.2% (n = 5), and sepsis 13.8% (n = 4).In ICU patients with COVID-19, AKI occurred in half of cases and was associated with baseline serum Cr level, use of IMV, and use of diuretics. In patients with more severe AKI (stage 3D), baseline serum Cr levels and higher blood levels of CRP at ICU admission were associated with requiring RRT. In the AKI group, the duration of IMV was prolonged, and the length of stay in ICU and in hospital was longer. AKI and RRT were independent risk factors for 60-day mortality.AKI in the context of COVID-19 has been subject to several previous studies. Cheng et al. [9] found an AKI rate of 5.1%. Lim et al. [18] reported an AKI incidence of 18.3% in hospitalized patients; among these, 37.5% were classified as stage 1. Hirsch et al. [3] showed that the incidence was even higher (36.6%), and the majority was in stage 1 (46.5%). Our study exclusively enrolled patients in the ICU, and the incidence of AKI was 50%. About 40% of these developed the mildest form (stage 1 AKI). Another initial small report of only 21 ICU patients demonstrated that 19% had AKI [11] . Recently, Gupta et al. [19] observed an incidence rate of 42.8% (restricted to stage 2 and 3) in 2,215 patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU.COVID-19 patients may also present with hematuria and proteinuria, suggesting inflammation and glomerular endothelial damage as an additional event in the genesis of AKI [12, 20, 21] . Our study shows that patients who have AKI also had a higher incidence of proteinuria. However, few patients had urinalysis available at the ICU admission and many had conditions associated with proteinuria (diabetes, hypertension, and obesity).In the current study, 72% of patients were diagnosed with AKI in the first 24 h of mechanical ventilation and IMV increased the risk of having AKI by almost 8-fold. This link has also been observed elsewhere [3] . In a cohort that evaluated only patients on mechanical ventilation, AKI occurred in 75% of patients [22] . In our study, AKI developed in 80% of mechanically ventilated patients. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, van den Akker et al. [23] showed that IMV increased the odds for AKI by 3 times. Despite the difficulty of dissociating the effects of the lung infectious/inflammatory disease on kidney function, several studies suggest that IMV may induce or worsen AKI [7, 24] and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this association [25, 26] .In our study, the use of a loop diuretic was associated with AKI. Studies using diuretics, especially furosemide, in patients at risk for or with overt AKI have presented mixed results [27, 28] . In the current study, we could not ascertain the cause and effect relationship between the use of diuretic and AKI.Higher baseline Cr was associated with AKI in this analysis. Multiple mechanisms present in CKD make critically ill patients more prone to AKI, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and changes in microcirculation [29] . A postmortem histopathology study showed mild to severe arterionephrosclerosis, diabetic nephropathy, and features suggestive of acute tubular injury in a case series of fatal COVID-19 infections. Furthermore, some of these patients had AKI during hospital admission [30] . These findings suggest that acute injury-on-CKD may also be connected in patients with COVID-19.Seventeen percent of overall patients required RRT. RRT was applied in 34% of patients with AKI and in 39% of those on IMV. According to Hirsch et al. [3] , 5.2% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 received RRT. Among patients with AKI, 14.6% underwent dialysis and, of those on dialysis, 96.8% were on ventilators [4] . Cummings et al. [31] analyzed 257 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and reported 31% on RRT. In the study by Gupta et al. [19] , the need for dialysis was 20.1%. Fominskiy et al. [22] evaluated patients with COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation and showed that 17.7% of patients required dialysis. Thus, AKI stage 3D seems to be common in patients with COVID-19, especially in those on ventilatory support.AKI could be a consequence of uncontrolled inflammation in COVID-19 patients [18, 22] . CRP blood level at ICU admission was an independent risk factor for di-alysis-requiring AKI in our cohort. Thus, high CRP levels could identify patients more prone to organ dysfunction, including kidney failure. High CRP level was associated with AKI in other diseases as well [32] [33] [34] .AKI and RRT mortality rates in our analysis were lower compared to other studies [19, 25, 35] . Differences in admission policies, length of follow-up, learnings from the experience of the first centers to suffer from CO-VID-19 outbreaks, and differences in population or in the prevalence of comorbidities make these comparisons difficult. In our cohort of patients, AKI and RRT were independent risk for 60-day mortality. Two meta-analysis also showed AKI was associated with increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients [35, 36] . On the other hand, other studies have not shown AKI as a risk factor for death in COVID-19 [31, 37] . Like other diseases, AKI in COVID-19 patients seems to be associated with adverse outcomes and its awareness must be highlighted.Our data confirm that AKI is a concern in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. Moreover, AKI develops temporally after the onset of IMV and its most severe stage is associated with baseline kidney dysfunction and signs associated with inflammation such as increased level of CRP. Finally, our findings provide important prognostic information regarding survival, time in ICU, time in hospital, and recovery of renal function in these patients.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on AKI in critically ill patients from Brazil, currently one of the epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was possible to track the clinical course of the COVID-19 from the beginning of the first symptoms to the onset of RRT. During the follow-up and after the mortality analysis, we were able to verify a definitive primary outcome, 60-day mortality, in 100% of the events of our cohort and report on renal recovery.Limitations exist as this is a single-center study and could include selection bias and limited external validity. However, it brings some useful information for professionals committed to the treatment of patients with CO-VID-19. ICU admission and discharge policies may differ between centers. However, the ICU multidisciplinary team developed a protocol comprising well-defined criteria for ICU admission. In 48% of the cases, we did not have a baseline Cr value and using the lowest value during hospitalization may have overestimated the incidence of DOI: 10.1159/000513425 AKI [13] . There is some controversy in using baseline Cr (independent variable) as a risk factor for AKI (dependent variable) since the definition of AKI requires this variable. However, multiple previous studies have assessed the role of pre-illness Cr as a predictor of AKI [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Finally, because this is an observational study, no cause and effect relationship can be inferred.In conclusion, we found that in ICU-admitted CO-VID-19 patients, the occurrence of AKI was common and temporally associated with IMV. Patients with high levels of CRP, perhaps presenting a greater inflammatory state, presented with the most severe form of AKI. AKI and RRT were independent risk factors for 60-day mortality.",Brazil,first author,2020-12-18,12
f8a503570477e32d3157209ec50c560ff11db5d6,"High prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among symptomatic healthcare workers in a large university tertiary hospital in São Paulo, Brazil","Since the emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China, in December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) has affected almost 38 million people from 214 countries and territories around the world [1] . In Brazil, the hardest hit country in Latin America, since February 25, 2020, approximately 5 million cases and 150,000 SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths were confirmed by October [2] .Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of healthcare-associated infections, due to the frontline nature of their work. According to WHO, during the SARS epidemic, in 2002-2003, rates as high as 20% of all persons affected were HCWs [3] .Although several studies already investigated the epidemiology of and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs in high-income countries, there is a lack of data from low and middle-income countries, where shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), diagnostic tests and other vital supplies represent one of the most urgent challenges faced by public health systems [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .Identifying and understanding the clinical characteristics, outcomes and risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs are of paramount importance to mitigate the spread of the virus in the hospital setting, for high risk patients and other HCWs. This information will be critical to inform screening strategies and infection control practices, particularly in places experiencing challenging scenarios, with high burden of disease and limited resources and protective supplies.In this context, we aimed to estimate the prevalence and the clinical presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection among symptomatic HCWs from a tertiary university hospital during the pandemic in São Paulo, Brazil, the current epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America.Between March 21st and May 22nd, 2020, HCWs from Santa Casa de São Paulo Hospital were defined as symptomatic and invited to participate in the study if presented with self-reported fever or any of the following: acute respiratory symptoms (cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, shortness of breath), loss or changed sense of smell or taste, ocular symptoms, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. HCWs were recruited as part of a research project with advertising warnings in diverse areas of the hospital.Santa Casa de São Paulo Hospital (SCSP) is a 600-bed university hospital, with primary, secondary, and tertiary care facilities and 4597 HCWs, of which 1902 (41.3%) are nurses, 1298 (28.3%) physicians (including the residents) and 1397 (30.4%) administrative staff.An electronic questionnaire (supplementary file 1), developed for this study, was performed, including information on clinical and demographic data, with a 15-day follow-up after onset of symptoms (supplementary file 2).Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs in 3 ml saline 0,9% were collected [2] and sent daily to the Laboratory of Clinical and Molecular Virology (LVCM) of the University of Sao Paulo-Brazil for molecular testing. The real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 were carried out using assays developed at the Charité (Institute of Virology, University of Berlin, Germany) and modified by LVCM [8] .Samples were collected between the second and the seventh day after the symptom's onset and 50 μl viral nucleic acid was obtained from 400 μl of swabs out on the NucliSens easyMag® platform fully automated (Bio-Merieux, Lyon, France).Study approval was given by the Ethics Committee of SCSP and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.Characteristics of the study population were presented in counts and percentages for qualitative variables and with means ± standard deviations (SD) for quantitative variables.The Chi-square test and the contingency table were used to verify the possible association with the qualitative variables. A significance level of 5% was established (p < 0.05). To assess the distribution of the quantitative variables, we used the Shapiro-Wilk test. For the quantitative variables that were not normally distributed, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used. We used Stata Statistics Software version 13.1 for this analysis.Multivariable analysis using logistic regression compared qualitative variables (variables with P < 0.20 in the univariable analysis were considered in the preselection). We used a Stepwise Forward method. For this analysis, we used the SPSS program version 13.0.In the period of the study, between March 21st and May 22nd, 2020, a total of 295 symptomatic HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 125 (42.37%) were found positive.Over the 10-week study period, positivity rates varied from 22.2% (CI 95 15.9-60.3%) in the second week to rates as high as 55.9% (CI 95 43.2-68.6%) in the sixth week, reaching a plateau (38-46%) in the following weeks ( Fig. 1) .Among the 295 HCWs included, 163 (55.3%) were physicians (residents, fellows, and assistants), 105 (35.6%) from the nursing staff, and the remaining 27 (6.4%) were physiotherapists, radiology technicians and others.The median age was 34.2 years (SD 9.9); 130 (44%) were younger than 30 years of age, and 205 (69.5%) were female. The average time between the onset of the symptoms and the RT-PCR testing was 6.3 days (SD 4.1). Presence of known underlying medical conditions was identified in 57 (19.3%) HCWs, of which 23 (7.8%) were persons with chronic lung disease or asthma, 12 (4%) metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus, 9 (3%) with cardiovascular diseases and 15 (5%) obesity with BMI ≥ 40. Only 7 (2.3%) were individuals over 60 years old ( Table 1) .The median age of the HCWs that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 was similar to the group that tested negative, (34.5 and 34 years, respectively). A higher proportion of male HCWs was found among HCWs who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (40% vs 23.6%. p = 0.002). We did not find significant differences in the prevalence of the most commonly reported underlying medical condition among HCWs that tested positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection: chronic lung disease or asthma (7.2% vs 8.2%. p = 0.91), metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus (3.2% vs 4.7%. p = 0.56), cardiovascular diseases (3.2% vs 2.9%. P = 0.98), obesity with BMI ≥ 40 (4.8% vs 4.7%. p = 0.73). The proportion of individuals over 60 years was also similar in both groups (0.8% vs 3.5%. p = 0.24). There was no association for testing positive with profession, medical The most frequent symptoms reported among HCWs who tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2, respectively, were headache (92.8 and 90.5%. p = 0.5), nasal congestion (88.8 and 87%. P = 0.76), cough (85,6 and 85%. P = 0.94), fatigue (89.6 and 81.7%. p = 0.06) and myalgia (84 and 78.2%. p = 0.21).Among the symptoms reported by the HCWs, fever and anosmia were statistically associated with positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Table 2 ).In the univariable analysis for risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity, male sex, anosmia, and fever were statistically significant (Table 3) . After multivariable logistic regression analysis, male sex (adjusted OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.26-3.61), anosmia (adjusted OR 4.40, 95% CI 2.21-8.74), and ocular pain (adjusted OR 1.95 95% CI 1.14-3.33) were associated with positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection.Among the 125 HCWs that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, follow-up information on clinical outcomes showed that 9 (7.2%) were hospitalized (seven were male) and 2 (1.6%) died. Although none of the 9 hospitalized COVID-19 HCWs were aged > 60 years, their median age (41.8 y) was higher than the median age of the COVID-19 HCWs that were not hospitalized (34.2 y). The first death was a 37-year old male, with a BMI ≥ 40. The second death was a 38-year old male with BMI > 40, hypertension and severe asthma (Table 4 ).Our results, showing a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs, are in line with previous data that demonstrated that HCWs have higher susceptibility to respiratory infections. These findings were also observed in other zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks (SARS and MERS), when a substantial proportion of the infected population were HCWs [3, 9] . They are repeatedly exposed to COVID-19 patients, particularly those working on frontline, where certain procedures (intubation, contact with secretions, aerosol-generating procedures) increase the risk of infection, highlighting the importance of using the recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) measures [14] . In our hospital, universal use of masks by all HCWs was implemented as a standard practice in the hospital only in the first week of May. According to the standard infection prevention protocol in place at that time, PPE was recommended only when caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. It is important to emphasize that during the whole study period, availability and access to PPE, as well as training and supervision from the infection prevention and control committee members, were fully provided to HCWs, with adequate adherence to the protocols. Hospitalized patients were in transmission-based isolation precautions only when presenting symptoms compatible with COVID-19 or with history of known exposure to a COVID-19 patient in the previous 14 days. Although HCWs are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at work, while caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, household and community transmission are also relevant, particularly during the period of the study, when an intense activity of community transmission was occurring in São Paulo (In May more than 200 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons within 14 days was reported) [15] .COVID-19 has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic illness to severe cases with multi-organ failure and death [10] . The rates of hospitalization among HCWs with COVID-19 (7.2%), as well as case fatality rates (1.6%) found in our study are similar to those reported in US among HCWs patients with data available on age and health outcomes (respectively 8 and 0.6%) [16] . Interestingly, these rates are lower than those found in non-HCWs population with COVID-19 in Brazil [17] , probably reflecting the younger median age of the HCWs of our hospital. Furthermore, it is likely that among HCWs the level of suspicion to the disease symptoms is higher, enabling them to an earlier diagnosis and treatment, which may improve COVID-19 outcomes, and identifying a higher proportion of mild cases. Similar to earlier findings [18] , our data also showed that male sex was associated with a higher risk of severe outcomes (78% of the HCWs that were hospitalized and both that died were men).There are conflicting results in the literature to identify the job category with the highest risk of COVID-19 among HCWs [6, 7, 11] . In our study, physicians represented the majority of the cases, even though nursing staff form the largest subset of employees, representing 41.3% of the HCWs in the hospital. Compared to other HCWs, physicians seem to have greater awareness of disease symptoms, facilitating their access to testing and medical care.In the city of São Paulo, the epicenter of the pandemic in Latin America, on June 14th, during the study period, there were 98,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, of which, 1902 (1.94%) were HCWs, with 26 confirmed deaths (CFR of 1.3%), similar to the CFR found in our study [15] . Data from China showed that a total of 3387 of 77,262 patients with COVID-19 (4.4%) were HCWs, with 23 deaths (CFR of 0.67%) [19] .The sustained high weekly prevalence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among symptomatic HCWs observed in our study (from 22.3 to 55.9%), when compared to similar studies from Asia, Europe and US [11] [12] [13] [14] [20] [21] [22] is concerning (Fig. 1) . The majority of our cohort had a mild illness, which could potentially represent a risk of continued routine of working throughout the illness, facilitating the transmission of the virus into the hospital to patients and other HCWs. It is also concerning the long median time between symptom onset and RT-PCR testing among HCWs found in our study (6.3 days), despite the presence of recommendations to self-isolation when symptomatic. The working overload and the limited number of HCWs during the peak of the pandemic, together with a lack of access to immediate testing outside the protocol during the study period in our hospital, are potential issues contributing for the long median time after symptom onset reported by HCWs when they were tested. This finding may represent a significant risk of increasing transmission. Similar studies in Europe demonstrated that a high proportion of HCWs maintained their work routine in the hospital even presenting mild symptoms [11] [12] [13] . At the time the study was conducted, the official policy in the hospital recommended that symptomatic HCWs should be immediately excluded from the workplace for a minimum of 14 days. Although HCWs in the hospital were instructed and trained, the results of our study highlight the importance of having not only well-stablished guidance on the use of PPE as well as clear recommendations on sick leave policies for all HCWs with suspected COVID-19, but also strong supervision for compliance.Limitations of this study include the single-hospital design and testing only symptomatic HCWs. The increased awareness of COVID-19 symptoms among physicians, facilitating their access to testing and medical care, comparing to other HCWs, contributed to a reporting bias, leading to an overrepresentation of this category in our study population. Furthermore, the study was not designed to identify the source of infection among symptomatic HCWs. This approach limited the possibility of a better understanding on the transmission dynamics as well as the true prevalence of SARS-Co-V-2 infection among HCWs. However, to our knowledge this is the first report describing prevalence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs in Latin America. One of the great challenges we faced in Brazil, and probably one of the reasons that contributed to the high burden of COVID-19 in the country, was the limited availability of virologic testing. Only suspected cases that were hospitalized could be tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the public health system. During the initial phase of the pandemic, even symptomatic HCWs were not able to be tested for the virus in our hospital as well as several others in the country. These limited testing clearly compromises the strategies to contain nosocomial transmission of the virus to inpatients and to other HCWs [23] . Expanding capacity of testing among HCWs, including not only symptomatic, but also asymptomatic (facilitating detection of those that are in the presymptomatic phase, when transmission is already occurring) is the logical strategy in places where budget-resource constraints are not present, particularly among groups like HCWs, susceptible to high exposure to infected patients. Recent data from a large UK teaching hospital demonstrated the value of a comprehensive screening, including asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic HCWs, emphasizing the importance of this expanded strategy for protecting patients and hospital staff [24] .The findings of this study confirmed the high burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers in the hardest hit city by the pandemic in Latin America and provides valuable information on symptoms in the early phase of COVID-19. Anosmia and ocular pain were symptoms independently associated with COVID-19 diagnosis. In low and middle-income countries, where limited availability of tests is frequent, these findings may contribute to optimize a targeted symptom-oriented screening strategy.",Brazil,abstract,2020-12-02,12
1be2db46746f6d6f07cc7863eb5c9036ab3a330f,A protein folding robot driven by a self-taught agent,"In present days, viral infection is a matter of great concern because a massive spread of a virus can significantly impact the well-functioning of society. This catastrophic effect has been painfully witnessed by the brutal blow of COVID-19 caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) (Gorbalenya et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 is one of the seven known coronaviruses to infect humans, including: HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Hu et al., 2015; Su et al., 2016; Cui et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2020) .The infection pathway of the coronaviruses occurs when the Spike (S) protein, a viral membrane protein, is attached to specific receptors found in the surface of the host cell. This interaction triggers a conformational change in the Spike protein and stimulates membrane fusion between the viral and cell membranes (Lim et al., 2016) . Hemagglutinin-Esterase, a glycoprotein present in some of the coronaviruses, helps in this attachment and in the destruction of certain sialic acid receptors of the host cell (Huang et al., 2015; Lang et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2008) .Effective infection depends on virus-host cell interactions, specifically on the structure of viral and host proteins; consequently, knowledge of protein folding mechanisms is crucial to develop a strategy for virus control (Doms et al., 1993) . Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an important role in modern protein folding research. Qin et al. (2020) presented a neural network model capable of learning how a specific amino acid sequence folds into a protein structure. Similar studies also tackle the protein folding problem using deep learning, machine learning, and other variations of neural networks (Xu, 2019) . Lately, significant advances have been reported about deep reinforcement learning algorithms and self-taught agents (Chang et al., 2018b; Anjomshoae et al., 2019) . For example, deep reinforcement learning and self-taught agents are now capable of outperforming humans in playing video games by watching pixels on the screen. This technique can also be adapted to learn about the protein folding problem. This paper describes a robotic structure that simulates a stable peptide chain embedded inside the Hemagglutinin-Esterase. This robotic structure is controlled or driven by a self-taught agent with the capacity to explore for future rewards and learn by itself the efficient protein folding policies required to create the strong local bond between cysteine (C) amino acids and hydrogen bonds to form an anti-parallel β-pleated sheet. Our model uses a combination of robotics, artificial neural networks, gradient descent, and reinforcement learning. We prove that using a subjacent robotic structure, an efficient protein folding process (policy), can be learned by a self-taught agent.The peptidic region from the protein HCoV -HKU1, Hemagglutinin-Esterase (HEs) was chosen to test the capacities of the virtual robot/agent to learn efficient folding policies. HEs structure consist of two identical polypeptide chains; each polypeptide contains three important domains: the membrane proximal domain (MPD), the esterase domain (E), and the receptor domain (R) (de Groot, 2006) . (Fig. 1A) .Based on the recent solved structure of HEs (Hurdiss et al., 2020; Sehnal et al., 2018) , RCSB Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org), the receptor domain is constituted by eleven secondary structures: one α-helix and 10 β-strands. The formation of a secondary structure is the first step in the folding process that protein takes to assume its native structure. Two of these β-strands form an anti-parallel β-pleated sheet structure stabilized by a disulfide linkage and hydrogen bonds between the amino acids in both sequences: 182 LYLVPLCL 189 and 218 DCIYI 222 (Fig. 1B) .To analyze the folding of this structure, the sequence from residue 190 to residue 217 was replaced by a β-turn structure with the following amino acids: GSPN. Then, the final peptide to test the self-taught capacity of the proposed agent becomes: 1 LYLVPLCLGSPNDCIYI 17The use of artificial intelligence in protein folding has recently become of much interest. The latest studies have focused on determining which is the most stable configuration of proteins (Noé et al., 2020; AlQuraishi, 2019) .AlphaFold (Senior et al., 2020 ) is a program belonging to Google, created to predict how proteins will fold themselves. The process is based on the principle that it is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analyzing co-variation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures. AlphaFold shows that it is possible to train a neural network to make predictions of the distances between pairs of residues in an efficient way, with highly accurate results. This process gives more information about the structure of the protein. The system is optimized by gradient descend algorithm, and it represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. In other recent works a Multi-scale Neighborhood -based Neural Network (MNNN) is proposed . The method focuses on alpha-helical proteins (as found in skin, hair, and many other mechanically relevant protein materials), and it is designed to learn how a specific amino acid sequence folds into a protein structure. The algorithm predicts the protein structure without using a template or co-evolutional information having a maximum error of 2.1 Å. Finally, the method finds that the prediction accuracy is higher than other models, and the prediction consumes less than six orders of magnitude time than ab initio folding methods. MNNN is a relevant method because it can predict the structure of an unknown protein that agrees with experiments. Therefore the model presents a great advantage in the rational design of new proteins.Other AI techniques have been tried before. In (Staples et al., 2019 ) AI methods and features are proposed, which explore new methods based on Reinforcement Learning and Support Vector Machine. Many of these methods require enormous computational power, however in (Xu, 2019) it is shown that using a powerful deep learning technique, even calculated with a personal computer one can predict new folds much more accurately than ever before. This method also works well on membrane protein folding.In previous work (Chang et al., 2018a) , we proposed an autonomous neural controller (ANC) capable of handling the mechanical behavior of a virtual, multi-joint robot, with many moving parts and sensors distributed through the body. This robot has an internal neural arrangements that burns ""dark energy"" (Raichle, 2006) , energy that seems to go nowhere, and generates behavior initiation by itself. This capacity is utilized first to create a learning agent that acquires good strategies or policies and second to assemble a robot whose mechanical dexterity is driven (controlled) by such self-taught agent, behaving as a Markov process. This agent is capable of running several thousands of learning episodes, after which the robot is capable of learning to efficiently lift by body contortions a heavy ball lying on the floor.For this paper, the model is adapted as follows: the peptide chain is constructed with a set of 17 moving parts, each of them representing one amino acid supported by a rigid structure, and having a set of closerange sensors, responsible for sensing and process near molecular forces.The associated self-taught neural agent is assembled with 17 sigmoidal neurons, inhibiting each other with balanced negative weights and sharing a common self-activating excitatory input ramp K, that forces all participant neurons in racing toward a 1.0 output. During a ramp, after a certain time, one participant (winner) will cross a threshold (end line), and values will be assigned to the agent outputs, according to the arrival order of the other neurons. Continuously added internal noise makes the race balanced and unpredictable (random). The structure of the self-taught neural agent is shown in Fig. 2 .The race output is converted to a vector of bounded positive and negative number through the formula:where alpha controls the degree of folding deformation of per cycle and the value 0.7 is an offset required to generated positive and negative amounts.Being an intrinsic neural structure, this trainable energy-burning network is used as the propelling element of the peptide chain folding, creating a dynamic ever moving creature. Before it becomes an efficient folder, the agent needs to develop adviser networks that will undergo an algorithmic training process where knowledge about folding is acquired and store through reinforcement learning principles. This clue information is finally saved in the weights (synapses) of a well-trained network. Once this goal is achieved, the network becomes an adviser to the agent, which can now take wise Markov decisions (see Fig. 3 ).When isolated from the world in each race, the agent generates a set of random folding information (increment/decrement) in terms of variations or ""deltas"" angles. These deltas are added to the values of the current angles, taken the folding to a new state where the immediate reward is captured. To satisfy Bellman equation requirements, the agent explores further into the future and moves to a new ""imaginary"" state, where it searches for a MAX value hidden somewhere in the logic of the proteins. A resultant discount reward is formed with the sum of both rewards, and the resulting path is memorized by gradient descend in the incipient adviser neural network.This equation states that the optimization to obtain a maximal reward in a sequential chain of state-decision events is solved by a summation of immediate events and events that happen in the future (Sutton and Barto, 2018) . The formula is defined by:The main established prerequisite is that to obtain a good reward in terms of control; the agent has to explore the future and search for a discounted MAX value, hidden somewhere in complexities of the system being represented. In terms of this paper, exploring the future requires a special kind of noise balanced training process, discussed in (Chang and Zhinin-Vera, 2020).A robot is designed to carry out the space-time physical actions of folding a peptide chain of 17 amino acids belonging to a receptor domain of the HEs protein, specifically the sequence:1 LYLVPLCLGSPNDCIYI 17 .Amino acids are linked together through a strong peptide bond, and every bond has an actuator (muscle) that controls the folding angle (angle[i]) between every two of them; this angle is codified in an 8 bits signal that covers the range from − 90 to +90 • from the center or aligned position. The set of folding angles is a known parameter and defines the internal representation of the robot. This internal representation is one of the input vectors that the agent receives as input in order to generate the set of variations or delta[i] required to produce the next folding state through the actual_angle plus the delta angle generated in Equation (1).Each amino acid has six sensors that determine the kind of amino acid located in its neighborhood, close enough to create short-range molecular effects, like strong bonds or polarity arrangement. An individual sigmoidal neuron of a bigger network controls each actuator. The network controls the overall space-time folding of the strand. Each output neuron produces a signal that represents the increment or decrement that each angle will experience in the next cycle. Fig. 4 shows a full protein-folding robot schema.In this section, the algorithm that learns to perform protein folding is described. In the initial state, the protein is presented in a slightly straight position. The neural agent burns energy to generates new positions and explores future rewards. When a reward is found, the agent memorizes through gradient descend and reinforcement learning the paths leading to even bigger rewards (good protein folding).The agent works by episodes that last at most 4000 training cycles. During each episode, the agent learns by positioning the peptide chain in one initial state and then exploring new territories by producing several angles and folding variations in the neighborhood. The reward should be maximal when the cysteine-cysteine bond is formed, and β-sheet appears, but given the very large number of possible foldings, the probability that these two events simultaneously occur by random search is very small. Instead, the agent will learn the folding in two logical stages: first accomplish the cysteine-cysteine bond (the stronger attraction between the given amino acids) and second form the β-sheet, with weaker bonds, but it has to be polarity aligned: Amino acids Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Proline (P) and Tyrosine (Y).During the cysteine bonding, the maximal reward is obtained when sensors detect a close encounter between cysteines. The previous folding state and sensors are taken as input, and the current delta folding vector Fig. 2 . Self-taught Neural Agent. Neurons are all equally excited by a repetitive ramp K. In each run, the agent burns ""dark energy"", fires and declares a unique vector folding variation (blue-red column to the right). These self-generated elements are added to the current vector angle, and the protein undergoes an internally achieved small twisting. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.) Fig. 3 . Adviser Neural Network Architecture. A reinforcement learning trained network receives the internal state (angle vector) and the sensor information as input. With this composite ""image"" the network has to learn to generate changes (predictions) in the protein folding that improve the probability of obtaining useful structures. as a target by gradient descend. To satisfy the search for the future conditions, this gradient descent algorithm compensates using noise as input and the NULL vector as target (Chang and Zhinin-Vera, 2020) .For every training cycle, the agent moves to a new state (folding) and once here captures the local reward and searches in its neighborhood for a folding sate that may produce MAX future reward. Once these two parameters are obtained, a reward discount is applied in terms of back propagation cycles (Chang and Zhinin-Vera, 2020) .During the β-sheet folding, the maximal reward is obtained when sensors detect a polarity match between the involved amino acids (L, I, P, Y). Again the previous folding state is used as input and the current delta folding vector as a target, using noise to compensate.After training the agent rapidly drives the peptide chain from any given starts position to the learned (β-pleated sheet) fold, following a Markov chain of decisions.The pseudo-code is shown in Algorithm 1.Several episodes with a maximum of 4000 cycles each are carried out. The episode starts with peptide chain in an initial straight random position. In each cycle, random delta angles ± are added to all angles and reward is measured as the proximity of cysteines. If nothing happens (reward = 0), explore the future with new delta angles. If cysteinecysteine proximity is detected by the sensors, do backpropagation, do noise balancing. Look into the future, if β-sheet is formed do backpropagation, do noise balancing. The knowledge acquired by the adviser network is now used as an input to the self-taught agent. Result: Efficient folding following a Markov chain.Folding processes include thermodynamic stability of the complex with concomitant formation of covalent and non-covalent bonds to form a stable structure. The first moves of the agent are focused on accomplishing the covalent bond between the cysteines and sequentially the hydrogen bonds, in order to stabilize the β-pleated sheet. The system learned to follow these rules and folded a partial section of the receptor domain of HEs protein in a competent way, needing only short-range sensors and a low-resolution representation of its internal state. Acquired knowledge makes possible to follow a short path when folding the peptide chain 1 LYLVPLCLGSPNDCIYI 17 into the protein shape: one β-pleated sheet. The sequence is shown in Fig. 6 .The performance of the program can be observed in Fig. 5 , where it is shown how the error of the agent decreases as it becomes a stable protein structure guided by rewards. The error that is measured corresponds to the distance between the cysteines and the rest of the proteins that make up the β-sheet. Fig. 4 . The protein folding robot. A multi-joint robot and its associated neural blocks have to learn to fold a peptide chain belonging to the HEs protein. The mechanical simulator is a chain of operative joints with independent muscles and neural controllability. The neural network receives sensor information and internal representation as input and produces folding information as output. The resultant robotic assembling and its driving agent must learn to fold a straighten chain into a 3D structure that comprises a cysteine-cysteine bond and an associate β-pleated sheet. Our study describes a method to design a robot driven by a selftaught generative agent that learns by reinforcement learning efficient policies to fold a section of the HEs protein. The agent sees the protein state through sensors and reads information about its current bending angles and molecular proximities. The agent then decides to move to a new state that leads towards a possible useful folding using the visual information gathered from the sensors. The robot contains an artificial peptide platform that behaves like a mechanical bending structure with a sensor that feeds sparse data to the self-taught generative neural agent. We have obtained comprehensive results proving that our agent working on this robot-like structure can learn to solve protein folding problems, it was also found that folding knowledge can be preserved in stable weights parameters. We are currently in the process of investigating complex folding problems, including other residue interactions such as hydrophobic and electrostatic. Beside the predicted distances and angle between pairs of amino acids, the agent will learn that specific amino acids would be involved in both interactions with different strength. In sum, the data presented in this paper together with complementary analysis will complete a full-protein folding training. Fig. 6 . Protein folding sequence. First, the agent has learned to bend the chain until the strongest Cysteine-Cysteine (in black) bond is completed. Once this interaction is stabilized, the agent uses its knowledge to align hydrogen bonds and finish the expected structure of a β-pleated sheet. The dotted lines symbolize other possible protein folds, which are not realized. The simulation shown in this figure is generated by the proposed system. Oscar Chang, Ph.D. obtained a Ph.

4acf8fd5308014cf22e074cf9bc17012a9477cba,Characterising early agricultural and food policy responses to the outbreak of COVID-19,"In the first few months of 2020, governments in many countries affected by the COVID-19 outbreak implemented lockdown regulations to limit the diffusion of the virus in their populations. These regulations forced most sectors to limit or halt their activities, with the exception of health, agriculture and food, and a few other sectors deemed essential for the basic needs of the population.Despite exemptions, these essential sectors faced significant challenges, due to both supply side factors (in particular health-related risks to workers with the sector, and limitations on the flows of people and products) and demand side ones (deriving from lockdowns and the economic burden imposed on a large share of the population unable to work). In the agriculture and food sector, these factors translated into three main types of impacts (Lusk et al., 2020; OECD, 2020b) :• Impacts on agricultural production: Border and internal measures created seasonal labour shortages especially for fruits and vegetable production, thereby exacerbating food losses, and constraining access to agriculture inputs. • Shifts in consumer demand: Income shocks reduced the demand for high value food products and increased food insecurity (Amare et al., 2020; Bauer, 2020) . Confinement measures shifted the demand for food from restaurant and caterers to staple and ready-to-eat foods and to supermarkets. A collapse in oil prices reduced the demand for biofuels. • Disruptions to the food supply chain: Processors and manufacturers were particularly affected by labour force impacts, which included workers becoming infected, absenteeism, and the effects of physical distancing and sanitary requirements. These effects were especially severe for perishable fruits and vegetables (Mahajan and Tomar, 2020) , and for the dairy and meat sectors. Slower safety, quality and certification checks, as well as impediments to transport and logistics services, limited access to inputs for food production.Governments responded to these constraints by undertaking a wide range of agriculture and food policy measures, with the objective of ensuring the continued production and delivery of affordable food to consumers, and addressing the needs of a growing vulnerable population. However, the types of policy response governments undertook varied widely across countries. This paper analyses the first set of agriculture and policy measures undertaken by 54 OECD and emerging economies 1 between January 1 and April 28, 2020. The assessment is valuable for three reasons. First, major policy decisions affecting agriculture and food were taken in the first few months of the COVID-19 crisis, when lockdowns were implemented in most OECD and G20 countries. While measures continue to be introduced, such major policy shifts warrant early inspection. Second, some of those measures may not be easily reversible, and have the potential to change the long term path of government policyfor better or worse (Barrett, 2020) . Building on the emerging literature, the paper initiates a discussion on the potential medium to long term implications of responses to COVID-19 in agriculture and food. Third, as governments react to an unprecedented crisis, they are scrutinising responses in other countries, both to draw quick lessons in terms of which policies may be effective, but also to anticipate potential spill-over effect across markets. These concerns are evident from information sharing and discussions at international fora, including the OECD, FAO, the G20 and the WTO. At the same time, the comparative analysis can help shed light on whether developed and developing economies have adopted different policy responses commensurate with the age structure of their populations and economic constraints in the food sector (Alon et al., 2020) .The analysis builds on a unique set of 496 unique measures collected directly from governments, and from complementary information found on public databases and reported in the 2020 edition of the OECD Agriculture Policy Monitoring and Evaluation (OECD, 2020a). 2,3 The investigative approach to compiling the database means that it may not be fully comprehensive. However, the fact that it is based on reports directly from officials, validated by analysts that follow these countries' agricultural policies, provides relative confidence that it captures the key policy measures in place in the countries covered during the period of reference. While the coverage is not fully global it does span countries at a broad spectrum of development levels, and includes the largest agricultural economies. Other efforts, which may be more comprehensive in specific dimensions, have been conducted by other international organisations. The World Bank developed a living document in which it tracked over 1000 social protection measures in over 195 countries (Gentilini et al., 2020) . The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) set up an online database on trade restrictions the agricultural sector (Laborde, Mamun and Parent, 2020) , while the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) initiative monitored market and trade related policy developments that may affect the four key commodity markets that it follows (wheat, maize, soybeans and rice). 4, The unique feature of the OECD database used in this paper, compared to those other efforts, is that it covers a broader set of measures spanning food and agriculture, from ministries' administrative decisions, to international agreements, labour measures, biosafety protocols, and producer and consumer assistance.The following section of the paper presents a categorisation of measures undertaken by governments. The third section discusses their significance and potential implications for the sustainability and resilience of the sector. The last section draws a few take away messages and identifies areas for further investigation.A diverse set of agriculture and food related measures were taken by governments in response to the crisis, focusing on agricultural production, the functioning of the food chain and consumer demand. 5 OECD (2020a) orders these measures into seven broad categories: 6 1) Sectorwide and institutional measures, 2) Information and co-ordination measures, 3) Measures on trade and product flows, 4) Labour measures, 5) Agriculture and food support measures, 6) General support applicable to agriculture and food, 7) Food assistance and consumer support. Each of these categories is further separated into 20 subcategories of measures, as indicated in Fig. 1 and illustrated in Table 1. As Table 1 displays, each of the covered countries employed different sets of measures in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Table A1 in the Appendix provides a count of measures of reported measures by country and category that further exemplifies this diversity; some countries applied measures in few categories, others covered all categories. The following section uses the seven categories of Fig. 1 to further categorise the type of measures undertaken by governments.This section analyses and discusses the distribution and types of Lockdowns and resulting agriculture measures may vary across countries with the dynamics of the virus. 6 While categories were designed to be mutually exclusive, a few measures could be considered to belong to two of the seven categories. These measures were grouped with the closest respective category in order to avoid double counting. Agriculture ministers of the G20 adopted a statement in which they discouraged trade restrictions, stressed the need to take the necessary actions to improve the functioning of food chains, and to support affected populations. In the Netherlands, compensation schemes were announced for horticultural producers who have experienced severe losses due to declining demand, and for French fry potato growers experiencing demand downfalls. 5.C. Administrative and regulatory flexibility Czech Republic, France, Germany, or Spain.In Spain, the enrolment period for agricultural insurance contracts was extended, and the government also relaxed documentation requirements for animal transport. 6. General support applicable to agriculture and food 6.A. Overall economic measures EU Member states, New Zealand, or the US.In New Zealand, food producers were eligible together with other business to benefit from the stimulus package, more than half of which to be disbursed by mid-June. 6.B. Social safety nets Brazil, Chile, Denmark, Indonesia, or Russia.In Indonesia, a social safety net program provided support for essential goods, including free electricity, housing support, essential goods and education. 7. Food assistance and consumer support 7.A. Food assistance Australia, Canada, China, Italy, or the UK.In the United Kingdom, digital supermarket vouchers were provided to low-income families with children in lieu (continued on next page) measures undertaken by the 54 covered countries from January 1 to April 28, 2020. To draw observations about the numbers and category of measures, we used the total number of unique measures reported by each country and that of the EU separately. However, when considering regional or national differences in the use of measures, we also counted EU measures as applied to each EU member state. While this inflates the number of measures for these countries, it is a more faithful representation of the measures that apply to each country.At the outset, it should be noted that the number of measures is an imperfect means to gauge engagement, as a single measure could have large effects while a group of smaller measures could have minimal implications. Still, it is assumed here that the distribution of the number of measures across different categories can give some indication of areas of particular emphasis for governments. Crossed with the type of measures employed, this can provide a sense of overall directions of the policy responses taken in the first four months of 2020, as done by Gentilini et al. (2020) for social protection and job measures. Partial measures of budget and stringency are also used in this section to provide complementary information.The number of measures are unevenly distributed among abovedefine 7 categories. The most frequently observed measures belong to category 5 (representing close to a quarter of total measures) on agriculture and food support, followed by categories 2, 6, 3 and 4 that cover information, general economic support, trade and product flows, and labour measures (Fig. 2) . At the same time, within each category, over 80% of countries undertook at least one measure, and 60% of the covered countries had measures covering all seven categories (Fig. 3) . Furthermore both information and coordination measures and measures on trade and product flows can be found in practically all countries.This suggests that a large majority of country introduced wide set of measures to support their agricultural sector, encompassing Fig. 3 . Proportion of categories of measures adopted by countries and number of categories covered Source: Derived from OECD (2020a).information, coordination, market and trade measures. In addition, governments undertook a particularly large number of agriculture and food support measures.Looking at cross-country differences, OECD (mostly developed) and non-OECD emerging economies implemented a different balance of measures (Fig. 4) . OECD countries introduced twice as many measures on average as non-OECD emerging economies (although the covered set of countries include more OECD countries). More specifically, measures in OECD countries focused largely on agricultural support (category 5) and information and coordination (category 2). In contrast, emerging economies adopted primarily measures related to trade flows (category 3) and information and coordination measures (category 2). The crossregional differences under categories 3 (product and trade flows) and 5 (agriculture and food support) are also the largest across all categories. OECD countries also introduced general support measures (category 6) with a share of total measures that was twice as large as that of emerging economies, while the reverse can be observed on food assistance and consumer support measures (category 7), as shown in Fig. 5 .These differences may be explained by existing commitments to government spending and by income levels. The prevalence of agricultural support in OECD countries is consistent with a historical tendency to support the sector; a trend that is only emerging in other countries. In contrast, a number of emerging countries in the dataset are large traders of food, with relatively low agricultural support (OECD, 2020a). The differences between OECD and non-OECD countries also reflect differences in funding capacity and in the focus of government spending under crisis (Alon et al., 2020) . Differences in the rates of general support and food assistance can be attributed to the higher share of food in total expenditures in lower income countries. A loss in income will affect the food security of many households, as seen for instance in Nigeria (Amare et al., 2020) .Significant variations can also be seen across OECD regions. Over a third of measures undertaken by OECD European countries were found in the category of agriculture and food support measures, whereas these measures were not introduced in the OECD countries of Oceania, which use very limited agriculture support. Over 45% of measures in Chile 7 were information and coordination measures (category 2). Close to half of the measures implemented by Oceanian and by Asian OECD countries 7 Chile is the only South American OECD country in the dataset. Colombia joined the OECD on April 28, 2020 so it was not considered an OECD country in this paper. are in categories 2 and 4 on information, coordination and labour. North American countries implemented measures that focused on information and coordination (category 2), and also introduced sector-wide and institutional measures, labour, and agriculture and food support measures (categories 1, 4 and 5) in identical proportions (representing 16% of their total). Japan and Korea undertook a number of often innovative information and coordination measures compared to other countries (OECD, 2020a).Interestingly, few of the unique measures-9% of the total-built on existing policy programs. The large majority of measures were new and temporary (73%) or new discrete (lasting) decisions (16%) that changed a policy without setting any particular limit. Some measures were announced but not applied yet (Fig. 6) .In most OECD countries and emerging economies, these measures were undertaken in contexts with complex pre-existing agriculture and food policies and regulations (OECD, 2020a). While some governments adapted existing policies and support mechanisms to respond to this new situation, many of the response measures were added to the existing set of support measures. This raises the question of whether new support and existing support may be reinforcing each other, overlapping in ways that make one policy redundant, or counteracting each other. An example of the latter was China releasing stocks of rice and procuring more rice at the same time.Budgetary expenditures provide a complementary indication of the importance of different measures. Unfortunately, the dataset does not include specific budgetary expenditure for every measure. 8 Instead some of the largest programs and initiative were reported. Table 2 gives a decomposition of these reported budget by category of measure. In total, a minimum USD 47.7 billion had been assigned to agriculture and food measures as of April 2020. As expected this budget was spent almost entirely on food assistance and agriculture and food support measures. Nearly all of this amount (USD 47.6 billion) was allocated in OECD countries. Within the OECD, the largest share of the budget, or over USD 45.9 billion, was reported by North America countries, with Europe (USD 1.3 billion), Oceania (USD 0.4 billion) and Asia (USD 0.02 billion) following. The sector also benefited from general economic measures, including recovery packages, in many countries, the total of which exceeds USD 1.5 trillion in the countries covered in the dataset.The geographical repartition of this incomplete budget information is partially consistent with the trends in number of measures, in that OECD countries used more support measures than others, but it also diverges when considering more specific measures. Counts of measures are not a good proxy for budgetary importance, and could misrepresent the importance of a government's response. Moreover, the association only makes sense for measures that inherently require budgetary spending (belonging mostly to categories 5, 6 and 7). In particular, setting up green lanes will not be expensive, but can be extremely powerful in ensuring the functioning of agriculture and food supply chains.Nonetheless, the estimated minimum budget of USD 47.7 billion represents significant spending in four months, even if the amount is small in the context of total annual support provided by consumers and taxpayers to the agricultural sector, which exceeded USD 700 billion in 2017-19 across all 54 countries surveyed.To better understand the possible implications of the policy responses, measures were sorted into three groups according to their timing and scope. The proposed classification aims to illustrate the range of measures and their possible implications. It offers a plausible grouping of measures, although for some subcategories of measures the assignation and boundaries could be debatable. The three groups of measures are defined as follows.• Urgent and necessary measures: These emergency measures are absolutely necessary to safeguard the safety of workers and ensure the minimum functioning of the agriculture value chains. Examples include declaring that the food sector is exempted from lockdown or setting up green lanes to facilitate markets. These measures are unambiguously meant to be eliminated as soon as either lockdowns are removed or the safety of workers can be guaranteed. This group includes 138 unique measures (28% of the total). They are deemed necessary to contain the impacts of the crisis on producers, consumers and other agents along the food chain for the proper functioning of the food system, but they need to include sunset clauses to avoid translating into systemic support in the long run. This category includes administrative flexibilities, different type of agriculture or consumer support, and other measures. This group includes the remaining 302 unique measures (62%).Consistent with these definitions, most of the urgent and necessary measures are in categories 1 to 4, covering sector-wide and institutional measures, information and coordination, trade and product flows and labour measures (Fig. 7) . No-regret measures are largely found in categories 2 and 3 on information and coordiation and on trade and product flows. Temporary relief measures include all general support measures (category 6) and almost all agriculture and food and consumer support measures (categories 5 and 7). As shown in Fig. 8 , neither OECD nor emerging economies have introduced a large share of no regret measures (10% each). The principal difference between the two groups is that OECD countries have introduced a larger proportion of temporary relief measures than emerging economies, while the reverse is observed in the case of urgent and necessary measures. These differences, if commensurate with the importance of government actions, are in line with the propensity of OECD countries to use funding for relief measures.Slight differences are also observed among OECD regions (Fig. 9 ). OECD Oceanian countries had a relatively larger proportion of urgent and necessary measures, OECD South America (Chile) has a relatively larger proportion of no regret measures, and Asian, European and North American countries included a larger set of measures belonging to the group of temporary relief measures.While urgent and necessary measure may not be needed to the same extent in each country, no regret policies should be encouraged everywhere as they offer long term benefit, potentially bolster the sector's resilience and do not create distortions in the long run. At the same time, temporary relief measures include social and food assistance measure that could be warranted so long as the economies are shocked, particularly in developing countries. Agriculture support measures in OECD countries, which often aim to support farmers' income in the face of demand drops, will need more immediate sunset clauses, commensurate with the lifting of market restrictions, to avoid introducing further market distortions into already distorted agriculture markets.Within the group of temporary relief measures, some measures have the potential to disrupt markets and trade, and to aggravate environmental stresses. These include trade restrictions and specific support to particular commodities, as well as the relaxation of environmental regulations, and should therefore be lifted as soon as possible. Fifty-two measures (10.5% of total unique measures) were identified in this subgroup, mostly belonging to categories 5, 3 and 7, focusing on agriculture and food support, product and trade flows and food assistance and consumer support (Fig. 10) .As shown in Fig. 11 , these potentially market distorting or environmentally harmful measures represent above 20% of measures applied in the agriculture and food support, trade and product flows and food assistance (5, 3 and 7) categories, and less than 5% of measures applied in other categories. At the same time 87% of countries applied potentially harmful measures for markets, trade or the environment, a proportion inferior to that for urgent measures but larger than the one for no regret measures (Fig. 12) .Measures with potentially negative consequences for markets, trade or the environment were found to be mostly temporary and new (62%), or building on existing policies (23%). Still, 12% of these measures were new measures that may last beyond the crisis if not reconsidered promptly. They also represented 16% of measures adopted in OECD countries, and 12% of measures undertaken by governments in emerging economies.Responses by governments on agriculture and food were largely related to the application of lockdowns and their consequences. To consider this factor, averages of the University of Oxford's government stringency index (Hale et al., 2020) , taken between January 1 and April 28 were derived for all the covered countries. As shown in Fig. 13 these indices vary from 25 to 56, with larger indices indicating more stringent measures during that period.Of interest, the sample average of the stringency index was larger for emerging economies (EE on Fig. 13) perhaps more aware of the urgency of reaction from their experience with the previous SARS virus. But it also applies to several South American countries, which had low infection rates early on but have large agglomerations of relatively poor populations. The fact that governments in emerging countries adopted stringent overall responses to the virus outbreak, together with possible concerns on food security, may explain why their early agriculture and food measures with response to COVID-19 focused on information coordination, trade and market measures, while initiating food assistance and consumer support programmes. In contrast, governments in many OECD countries, which did not implement as strong lockdown measures, appear to have prioritised measures on overall social and business support, farm support and labour measures.No statistical relationship could be drawn between the number of measures and the stringency of government responses. At the same time, Fig. 14 suggests that regions with higher stringency indices may have had higher proportions of urgent measures than others and regions with relatively lower stringency indices have more potentially harmful measures for markets, trade or the environment. Still no definitive conclusion can be drawn from this preliminary data analysis.This article provides an overview of early policy responses undertaken by governments in response to the COVID-19 outbreak and associated lockdown policies. While it does not consider the effectiveness of adopted measures, it is clear that those adopted as a matter of urgency by the countries covered in this article played a critical role in ensuring the continued delivery of food to markets and in supporting a large population facing major income shortfalls. Government measures also helped the value chain to redirect food products from traditional public and private catering services to retailers and food banks. The crisis encouraged changes that were needed pre-crisis and are likely to deliver a better functioning of agriculture and food sector in the future, such as improved information on market condition, and coordination among stakeholders. Furthermore, some governments provided innovative responses to key challenges for the sector. These were achieved with limited expenditures but likely positive effects and may provide examples for others to follow in future crises.At the same time, other measures, while most often temporary, were likely detrimental to the functioning of the sector as a whole, with adverse effects on consumers (import restrictions or local promotion measures), producers (export restrictions), food chain actors (market distorting measures), and the environment (regulatory relaxations, input subsidies). This was done despite national, regional and international calls, statements and agreements to avoid measures that would impede the smooth functioning of domestic and international markets. The effects of these measures will need to be assessed when the crisis is over, to help all actors learn lessons ahead of future new crises. By aiming to support some actors at the detriment of others, they also may have impacted the actual resilience of the entire food system, even if temporarily.The analysis of the distribution of the measures undertaken by 54 countries during the first four months of 2020 provides some early insights into emphasis, scope and regional diversity of policy responses. Emerging economies, which on balance had more stringent lockdowns than OECD countries, focused their attention on trade and market interventions, information and coordination and food assistance measures, and more particularly on measures that were urgent and necessary. By contrast, OECD countries relied more on support measures, be that in the form of agriculture and food sector support, general economic assistance, or temporary relief measures. South American and Oceanian OECD countries undertook a relatively larger share of urgent or no-regret measures than Asian, North American and European members. 16% of the measures taken by OECD countries could also be ""potentially harmful"", in the sense of disrupting markets and trade or leading to negative environmental outcomes, with higher proportions for OECD and non-OECD European countries. Lastly, a first and incomplete review of announced expenditures suggest that at least USD 48 billion was spent on the sector, with most expenses in North American countries, focusing on food assistance and agriculture and food support measures. This is a significant amount, but only represents about 7% of the total support that these countries provided to their agriculture sectors in 2019.More analysis will be needed on the key measures undertaken by each country, to gauge their effectiveness and overall costs, when data become available. More broadly, a better understanding of the measures taken will be needed to understand which have the potential to strengthen the resilience of the agriculture and food sector in the face of future crises, not least those associated with climate change.

607e0d9135c2cc713915df840601ecb98e13cce2,Can selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have a neuroprotective effect during COVID-19?,"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has been associated with a plethora of neurological and physiological responses (Berger et al., 2009) and it also has immunomodulatory properties (Baganz and Blakely, 2013; Wu et al., 2019) . We now know that different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection take place, namely infection phase, asymptomatic or low-symptomatic phase, followed by a mildly symptomatic phase and eventually a severe phase (when an exacerbated inflammation is a major concern), which can be lethal (Ayres, 2020) . One important aspect observed in severe patients is the positive association with cytokine release syndrome,i.e., an exacerbated systemic inflammatory response that may be triggered by infections, for instance (Chatenoud et al., 1989) , in particular the increase of peripheral interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels. Interestingly, TNF-α levels highly correlate with SARS-CoV-2 load (Lucas et al., 2020) and IL-6 has been suggested as an early inflammatory marker to predict severe illness in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Aziz et al., 2020; McElvaney et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020) . This hyper-inflammatory state that is also observed in the severe phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection can damage tissues beyond the lungs, including the brain, and has deleterious neurological and neuropsychiatric consequences Yuan et al., 2020) . The psychosocial effects of the striking economic and health system crises caused by the pandemic along with the pre-existing worldwide psychosocial factors must also be remembered as potential threats to psychiatric disorders (Ajilore and Thames, 2020; Batty et al., 2020; Lassale et al., 2020) .Given the broad spectrum of central and peripheral 5-HT actions and the urgency to find new perspectives for the management and treatment of COVID-19 patients, here we discuss the potential use of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors not only for treating anxiety/depressive disorders but also as an adjuvant therapy to decrease SARS-CoV-2-induced exacerbated inflammatory response.Serotonin arises from tryptophan metabolism and plays different roles in the brain. Sleep, body temperature, motor control and several behavioral effects (mood, memory, fear, perception, stress) are some of the central functions regulated by 5-HT (Berger et al., 2009 ). This neurotransmitter is mainly known due to the intense research over the last 40 years investigating the modulatory effects of serotonergic system by exploiting the effects of certain drugs aimed at the treatment of depression, a key area of research in psychiatry (Mann, 1999) . Moreover, it is well-known that 5-HT is effective not only to treat depression but also to decrease the susceptibility to depression and suicide (Li and He, 2007) . Interestingly, stimulation of the serotonergic pathway is thought to be so beneficial that the use of non-pharmacological methods to increase 5-HT levels have been suggested as a potential strategies to prevent depression and/or improve mood and social functioning, by means of exercise (Sbolli et al., 2020) or exposure to bright light (Harrison et al., 2015) , for instance.Adding to this scenario, we have recently reported the potential effects of central 5-HT in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced severe septic like systemic inflammation (Mota et al., 2019) . We have found reduced 5-HT levels in the hypothalamus that coincided with hypotension, increased heart rate, hypothermia followed by fever, increased plasma prostaglandin E2, nitric oxide, and cytokine levels after LPS intravenous administration. Interestingly, exogenous 5-HT given intracerebroventricularly prevented hypotension, reduced plasma nitric oxide (NO), blunted hypothermia, and potentiated fever, which were associated with reduced LPS-induced TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β surges.These aforementioned data add support to previous studies about the role of brain 5-HT during systemic inflammation (Mota et al., 2017; Voronova et al., 2016) . The role of central 5-HT in inflammation was first described by evaluating serotonin 5-HT 2A receptor activation reversing LPS-induced neuroinflammation by attenuating NO levels (Voronova et al., 2016) . However, the first anti-inflammatory effect in the periphery in a model of LPS-induced mild systemic inflammation was described by Mota et al. (2017) , by observing that intracerebroventricular injection of 5-HT effectively reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines surges.Low-grade systemic inflammation is characterized by sustained lowlevels of some peripheral cytokines. This phenomenon is observed in a myriad of diseases such as neuropsychiatric and metabolic disorders (Minihane et al., 2015; Osimo et al., 2019; Rorato et al., 2017) . There is an understanding that this inflammatory response has a significant impact in neuropsychiatric alterations (Heneka et al., 2015; Miller and Raison, 2016; Perry, 2010; Shastri et al., 2013) and metabolic disorders (Hotamisligil, 2006) in some cases. Importantly, adipose macrophage abundance is correlated with adiposity in high-fat diet (HFD) model (Weisberg et al., 2003) . HFD also increases hypothalamic inflammation (De Souza et al., 2005; Milanski et al., 2009) . Interestingly, obesity is associated with a range of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression (Gariepy et al., 2010; Hryhorczuk et al., 2013) . In a systematic review about obesity as a factor that raises the risk of developing anxiety disorders, a mild association was observed between these two disorders (Gariepy et al., 2010) . More recently, it was speculated that one of the connections between obesity and anxiety is inflammation (Capuron and Miller, 2011; Lasselin and Capuron, 2014) , and metabolic disorders have been suggested as a link between obesity and depression (Hryhorczuk et al., 2013) . This is relevant information since severe SARS-CoV-2 infection has also been correlated with increased body mass index (Lucas et al., 2020) which can also be epidemiologically translated by the high death prevalence between patients with metabolic disorders (KHAN et al., 2020 preprint) . It is suggested that the pre-existing underlying inflammation in obese patients may result in a dysfunctional immune response during COVID-19, predisposing to a more severe condition (Seidu et al., 2020) . Obesity is often associated with type 2 diabetes and it has been shown that uncontrolled glucose levels promote SARS-CoV-2 replication, increase cytokine release and induce T cell dysfunction (Codo et al., 2020; Seidu et al., 2020) . Hypercoagulopathy, an important component of COVID-19 pathophysiology, is also exacerbated in people with obesity (Pasquarelli-do-Nascimento et al., 2020). Metabolic disorders have increased in low and middle-income countries populations (Miranda et al., 2019) , which are also greatly impacted by the economic crises initiated by the pandemic outbreak.There are plenty of articles using HFD as a pre-clinical model to evaluate depressive and anxiogenic-like behavior in obesity (Haleem and Mahmood, 2019; Kim et al., 2013; Zemdegs et al., 2016) . Most of them have demonstrated that HFD decreases plasma and brain 5-HT levels (Haleem and Mahmood, 2019; Kesic et al., 2020) followed by an increase in anxiogenic and depressive-like behaviors (de Noronha et al., 2017; Gomes et al., 2020; Zemdegs et al., 2016) . Interestingly, peripheral and central 5-HT have opposite roles on metabolic homeostasis: while circulating 5-HT favors the onset of obesity (Crane et al., 2015) , brain serotonin diminishes weight gain by regulating food intake and brown adipose tissue activity (Kesic et al., 2020) . Pharmacological interventions that restore central serotoninergic levels in obese people could be helpful not only to regulate immune response during an infection, like COVID-19, but also to treat and prevent consequent neuropsychiatric alterations.Altogether, taking the effect of central 5-HT in attenuating severe septic like inflammation and mild systemic inflammation, we believe that this decrease in central 5-HT levels might have a role in low-grade inflammation observed in these disorders.Reconciling available data in the literature, a potential central effect of 5-HT on systemic inflammation is suggested and the mechanisms would involve inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines production that would compensate a reduced endogenous central serotonin production that take place in systemic inflammation.One may wonder how does brain 5-HT exerts its anti-inflammatory effects in the periphery in such an effective way that LPS-induced hypotension and hypothermia are abolished. The answer may reside in the finding that pro-inflammatory responses seem to actually be modulated by neural circuits that link the areas of physiology, immunology, and neuroscience (Martelli et al., 2014; Okusa et al., 2017; Tracey, 2002) . The ""inflammatory reflex"" has been documented as an effective anti-inflammatory mechanism in systemic inflammation (Tracey, 2002) . The afferent pathway of the ""inflammatory reflex"" relies on the vagal nerve that is sensitized by circulating cytokines (Komegae et al., 2018) , leading to reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the spleen (Okusa et al., 2017) . Mota et al. (2019) showed that 5-HT may activate the splenic inflammatory reflex, since i.c.v. 5-HT administration reduced the production of spleen TNF-α, which is in agreement with the notion that specific signaling pathways inhibit spleen TNF-α production (de Jonge et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2014) . The effect of hypothalamic 5-HT has been elegantly reviewed by Rummel (2019) .Besides the central effects of 5-HT, it is important to mention that most of the body's 5-HT is actually found in the circulating platelets of the bloodstream (Berger et al., 2009 ) and this peripheral 5-HT plays several roles. Systemic 5-HT arises from the enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal tract. Under resting conditions, plasma 5-HT concentration is about 10 nmol, but it increases to micromolar levels when platelets become activated by inflammation, for instance (Mossner and Lesch, 1998) . Once released, 5-HT functions are mediated by at least 7 (so far documented in mammals) serotonin 5-HT receptors classes (5-HT 1 through 5-HT 7 ), as well as by the 5-HT transporter (SERT) located presynaptically on serotonergic axon terminals.Circulating serotonin modulates numerous functions not only in the cardiovascular system, respiration and gastrointestinal functions but also in nociception, coagulation and reproduction (Berger et al., 2009 ). In addition to regulating hemostasis, several immunoregulatory functions of peripheral 5-HT have been reported to be mediated through a direct effect of 5-HT on circulating immune cells (Roszman et al., 1985) .These immune cells express different serotonin receptors subtypes, SERT, the enzymes for serotonin synthesis, i.e., tryptophan hydroxylase, and for serotonin degradation, i.e., monoamine oxidase (Herr et al., 2017) . In the innate immune system, the first line of defense against pathogens, it has been shown that 5-HT inhibits LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines and induces M2 (anti-inflammatory) polarization of human macrophages through serotonin 5-HT 2B and 5-HT 7 receptors (Quintero-Villegas and Valdes-Ferrer, 2019). The use of a serotonin 5-HT 7 receptor agonist in experimental sepsis reduces plasma IL-1β and IL-6 and also lung NFκB, increasing survival (Cadirci et al., 2013) . Dendritic cells express several receptor subtypes and are able to use serotonin to promote T-cell proliferation and naive T-cell differentiation, showing a serotoninergic action also in adaptative immunity (O'Connell et al., 2006) . Interestingly, some studies report that serotonin can have inflammatory effects in the gut through serotonin 5-HT 3 and 5-HT 4 receptors (Salaga et al., 2019) , showing that serotoninergic action is tissue-and receptor-specific.The bidirectional communication between the serotoninergic system and viral infections has also been investigated, although to a lesser extent. Polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) is a potent immunostimulant and has been used as a methodological approach to mimic viral infections, given its interaction with toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), which is involved in the activation of the immune response following virus recognition (Lever et al., 2015) . Systemic administration of poly I:C increases the expression of the serotonin transporter (SERT) and reduces extracellular 5-HT in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rats, an area associated with essential cognitive and limbic functions (Katafuchi et al., 2006) . The increased SERT expression in astrocytes of this brain region is at least partially mediated by TLR3 pathway signaling, microglial activation, and IL-1β production (Ifuku et al., 2014) . Furthermore, poly I:C increases tryptophan in the hippocampus and PFC, but this amino acid is directed to the kynurenine pathway which produces several metabolites that may disrupt normal brain function (Gibney et al., 2013) .Peripheral 5-HT is also able to modulate several mechanisms of different viral infections. Subpopulations of human dendritic cells express serotonin 5-HT 2B receptor that when activated suppresses the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during a viral stimulus (Szabo et al., 2018) . Serotonin also increases the cytotoxicity of natural killers (NK) cells, probably through serotonin 5-HT 1A receptor (Hellstrand and Hermodsson, 1990) .The role of 5-HT in the immune response in specific viral infections has also been addressed. For example, 5-HT decreases HIV infection in human macrophages by down-regulating the expression of CCR5, an essential receptor for virus entry in the cell, probably via serotonin 5-HT 1A receptor (Maneglier et al., 2008) . Additionally, buspirone, a serotonin-receptor agonist, was able to decrease T-CD8 cell count and increase CD4/CD8 ratios in HIV-infected patients (Eugen-Olsen et al., 2000) . Inhibition of chikungunya (Bouma et al., 2020) , reovirus (Mainou et al., 2015) , and parainfluenza (Rabbani and Barik, 2017) infection has also been shown to be mediated by this monoamine. However, 5-HT immunomodulatory actions may be virus and/or receptor-dependent, as exemplified by JC virus infection, where virus internalization is stimulated by serotonin 5-HT 2A receptors (Assetta et al., 2013; O'Hara and Atwood, 2008) .The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic raised global attention after the rapid spread of this disease, reaching more than 15 million cases and 600,000 deaths less than eight months after the first documented cases in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The infection by this new virus, named SARS-CoV-2 led to worldwide efforts to rapidly understand the pathophysiology of this disease and the search for efficient treatments.Primary targets of SARS-CoV-2 are airway epithelial cells and pneumocytes, which are invaded after the virus binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and TMPRSS2 activation (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . Following replication in the infected cells, new virions are released and this acute and severe infection promotes initially a local inflammatory response, with the release of proinflammatory cytokines (Wiersinga et al., 2020) . Macrophages and mononuclear cells infiltrate alveolar tissue and induce edema formation, which may explain the respiratory symptoms of this disease, like cough, difficulty breathing, and even pneumonia (Wiersinga et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020) .This progressive and dysregulated host response to infection, with a sustained innate inflammatory response, extrapolate to a systemic level, with progressive immune effects and excessive circulating inflammatory cytokines. Plasma concentrations of IL-1β, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, IFN-γ, and other mediators are increased in severe COVID-19 patients . At the cellular level, it is reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection decreases TCD4 + and TCD8 + lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils Qin et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) . Patients with metabolic disorders (e.g. obesity and type 2 diabetes) are at a higher risk of developing a more severe form of the disease, since they are predisposed to an even more uncontrolled inflammatory response, with additional production of cytokines and deficient cell immunity in COVID-19 and other infections (Andersen et al., 2016; Codo et al., 2020) .This abnormal immune state and the cytokine release syndrome play an important role in the clinical manifestations, including neurological alterations. One of the early symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is the loss or reduction of smell and taste (Lechien et al., 2020; Spinato et al., 2020) .Although not yet proved to occur in humans, SARS-CoV-2 is able to invade the olfactory bulb of transgenic mice expressing ACE2 receptor and spread to other brain regions (Netland et al., 2008) .Some of the most common complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection are the cerebrovascular events, mainly ischemic stroke (Beyrouti et al., 2020; Bridwell et al., 2020) . These events could be associated with coagulation alterations, given that COVID-19 infection is characterized by high fibrinogen and D-dimer (a fibrin degradation product) concentrations that lead to a prothrombotic state and disseminated intravascular coagulation (Goshua et al., 2020) . Cytokine release syndrome is a major component of coagulopathy since it activates the coagulation cascade and promotes endothelial dysfunction (Colantuoni et al., 2020) .The inadequate blood supply and concomitant impaired pulmonary function may critically decrease cerebral oxygenation and have deleterious consequences in brain function. Low oxygen levels may result in tissue hypoxia, which further causes cell death, activation of brain immune cells, oxidative stress and the consequent production of inflammatory mediators, like cytokines and chemokines (Liu and McCullough, 2013) . Post-mortem analysis of COVID-19 patients revealed astrocytosis and loss of neurons in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum . Increased cytokine release during COVID-19 could induce the onset of cerebrovascular and neurological alterations or worsen pre-existing conditions, since these disorders are associated with the production of inflammatory mediators (Deleidi and Isacson, 2012; Ellul et al., 2020) .In addition to neurological disorders, neuropsychiatric complications are also a concern in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Individual reports and case series have described alterations including delirium, mild cognitive impairment, psychosis, and mood swings (Dinakaran et al., 2020) . A nationwide surveillance study identified altered mental status in 31% of COVID-19 patients, including syndromic diagnosis like encephalitis but also primary psychiatric disorders like psychosis, dementia, and mania .The rapid spread of the disease and the absence of immediate therapeutic interventions to effectively treat SARS-CoV-2 infection led the scientific and medical community to rethink the use of already available drugs in order to improve clinical outcomes. In this scenario, the use of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) could be considered an adjuvant in COVID-19 pharmacological therapy.This class of drugs was launched in the market more than three decades ago and has well described pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, making it a safer option as a possible treatment. Clinical and experimental studies support the hypothesis that 5-HT could help to dampen the excessive production of cytokines during the systemic inflammatory condition caused by COVID-19 and diminish its deleterious consequences. Serotonin could not only act directly in circulating peripheral immune cells by binding to specific serotonin 5-HT receptors (Herr et al., 2017) but also through central neural mechanisms like the anti-inflammatory vagal reflex (Mota et al., 2019) .Selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors increase brain 5-HT availability by crossing the blood-brain barrier and inhibiting central SERT (Hervas and Artigas, 1998) , but it has been shown that vagus nerve stimulation can augment central production of 5-HT in some brain areas, indicating an alternative neural mechanism of monoaminergic system control (Manta et al., 2013) . It must be highlighted that the decrease of anxiety and depressive-like symptoms during fluoxetine and sertraline treatment is partially dependent on indirect CNS activity by vagus nerve signaling (McVey Neufeld et al., 2019) and that vagal stimulation has been recently described as a therapeutic approach to treat depression (Aaronson et al., 2017; Krahl et al., 2004) . Interestingly, one main feature of vagal stimulation is systemic inflammation attenuation (Pavlov and Tracey, 2012) . However, more studies must be conducted to evaluate if SSRI/vagus association might also have a role increasing central 5-HT levels and thus, attenuating systemic inflammation.In agreement with this perspective, fluoxetine (the first and one of the most prescribed 5-HT reuptake inhibitors) inhibits viral replication (Bauer et al., 2019; Zuo et al., 2012) and increases NK cells activity in HIV patients (Evans et al., 2008; Frank et al., 1999) . Centrally, this drug inhibits microglial activation and decreases cytokine production by these cells (Liu et al., 2011) . Interestingly, an in vitro study showed that fluoxetine has a specific action inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection (Zimniak et al., 2020 preprint) . A clinical trial (NCT04377308) is currently investigating the effect of this drug on clinical outcomes and cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. Obviously, other selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors may also regulate immune function during viral infections (Greeson et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2014; Sharma et al., 2013) .Furthermore, selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors may modulate the inflammatory response not only by direct serotonergic mechanisms. Fluvoxamine, for example, has significant immunomodulatory properties by downregulating inflammatory pathways and cytokine production in monocytes through its high affinity to sigma-1 receptor (S1R) (Rosen et al., 2019) . Also, interestingly, an ongoing clinical trial (NCT04342663) is currently exploring the potential benefits of this drug in COVID-19. Several other selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors interact with S1R and could also have anti-inflammatory properties (Ishima et al., 2014) .To summarize, there is significant evidence in the scientific literature to encourage the use of 5-HT reuptake inhibitors as a complementary intervention during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The direct immunomodulatory action of central and peripheral 5-HT, associated with other indirect mechanisms, could effectively dampen the exacerbated immune response and prevent neurological complications (Fig. 1) . Additionally, it would be relevant to consider that patients under long-term SSRI therapy should continue the use of their medication when hospitalized due to COVID-19.As always, for any treatment, the adverse effects must be kept in mind, especially when patients are being treated with several combined drugs that may increase the risk to develop serotonin syndrome, for example (Mas Serrano et al., 2020) . Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a potentially lethal drug-induced disorder caused by serotoninergic over-activity at synapses of both central and peripheral nervous systems (Scotton et al., 2019) . In SS an altered mental state, tachycardia, hyperthermia, hyperreflexia with clonus, ocular clonus, myoclonus, tremors, or rigidity may be observed (Buckley et al., 2014) . This serious condition is usually caused by the combination of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, opiates, or tricyclic antidepressants among others drugs (Scotton et al., 2019) .This work was financially supported by Grants #2019/27231-9 and #2016/17681-9, São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) and by Grants # 301040/2018-4 and # 404927/2018-1 National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Brazil. The excessive production of inflammatory mediators may be attenuated by augmenting central and systemic 5-HT levels and also by the activation of nonserotoninergic pathways in immune cells. We believe that 5-HT reuptake inhibitors can blunt the exacerbated immune response in COVID-19 and ameliorate clinical consequences, such as the development of neuropsychiatric disorders and death.None.",Brazil,first author,2020-12-15,12
a9fb1f2279bfd3460b673e546f9a9b1aacd2f421,"An emergency system for monitoring pulse oximetry, peak expiratory flow and body temperature of patients with COVID-19 at home: Development and preliminary application","We are experiencing a global pandemic due to COVID-19 of devastating consequences. 36The highly infectious pathogen that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, has infected most 37 of the countries in the world, with over 62.7 million confirmed cases, and just under 38 1.460 .000 deaths as of December 1, 2020 [1] . 39As the hospital environment becomes more crowded, the criteria for hospital 40 admission become progressively stricter and, as a consequence, more severe patients stay 41 in their homes awaiting improvement or worsening. It was pointed out previously that a 42 rapid clinical deterioration may occur in the initial phase of COVID-19, due to the 43 development of arterial hypoxemia without a concomitant increase in work of breathing 44[2]. This can prevent an adequate perception by the patient of the real magnitude of the 45 problem. In this context, patients have emerged who silently and rapidly decompensate 46 respiratory function at home, progressing to death even before receiving specialized care. 47Thus, it is essential to obtain severity markers, especially to predict and prevent the 48 evolution to hospitalization in ICU and death. In this emergency scenario, a consensus 49 has emerged in the literature on the need to institute home monitoring of these patients 50 [3] [4] [5] , enabling early identification of those who deteriorate acutely and require urgent 51 assessment. 52The general architecture of the system is reported in Figure 1 . The system consists mainly 115 of two parts: 1) the home-based patient unit, which is set up around the patient to acquire 116 data and to receive medical recommendations, and 2) the hospital unit, which enables the 117 medical staff to telemonitor the patient's condition and help to send medical 118 recommendations. 119 120 Insert Figure 1  121 122 Considering the urgency of patient care, the home-based patient unit was 123 developed using readily available commercial instruments. In order to simplify the use of 124 the system by patients, easy-to-use instruments were selected. Thus, patients were 125 assessed using a portable pulse oximeter (finger type, BIC model YK-80A) together with 126 a disposable peak flow meter (Medicate, model 72000M). The used thermometer was the 127 one owned by the patients. 128The home unit allows the data transmission from the patient to the hospital, which 129 is performed using a cell phone application. The application was developed in Java using 130 the integrated development environment Android Studio (version 3.6.3). It is based on a 131Google, the script saves the data in a worksheet according to the patient ID. To this end, 139 the application uses Google Sheets (spreadsheet where data is saved) and Google Scrips 140 (script that integrates the application and Google Spreadsheet). As a result, the application 141 creates an Excel file with one spreadsheet for each patient, which the maximum size is 5 142 million cells. 143Additionally, the values obtained in these exams are also recorded by the patients 144 in a follow-up paper personal diary. These diaries are provided to patients at the beginning 145 of the monitoring. This redundancy is important in order to maintain the perfect 146 functioning of the system even in case of failures in the Internet or other system 147 component. 148increased BPM values. This was also the first study to investigate the use of PEF in 298 COVID-19. The proposed system allowed us to quickly respond to early abnormalities in 299 patients with COVID-19. 300During the 30-days period of the initial tests of the proposed system, 720 data-points 301 regarding SpO2 were remotely obtained, resulting in a total of 16 alerts among the 12 302 monitored patients (Figure 6 ). It was observed that these alerts resulted from an abrupt 303 drop in SpO2 rather than a gradual decline. This is consistent with previous results [23], 304 and is probably associated with the rapid deterioration caused by a surge in 305 proinflammatory molecules in the ""cytokine storm"" phase of COVID-19 [27] . 306The values of SpO2 were reduced in patients with COVID-19 in comparison with 307 controls ( Figure 8A ). This finding is consistent with the observation that in the initial 308 phase of COVID-19 there is an increase in V/Q mismatch and thus persistence of 309 pulmonary arterial blood flow to non-ventilated alveoli. The current understanding is that 310 this results from the infection, which leads to a modest local interstitial edema and loss 311 of surfactant. These factors are associated with alveolar collapse and intrapulmonary 312There is general agreement in the literature that, given the severity of the ongoing 344 global pandemic, the ability to remotely monitor patients who do not require 345 hospitalization is essential for optimal utilization of health care resources This procedure hold the potential to increase bed availability without compromising safe 360 patient care. 361Secondly, one could argue that the study presents a small sample size, and 366 additional studies, including a more significant number of subjects are necessary. These 367 studies would allowed us to perform a detailed investigation concerning the utilization of 368 home pulse oximetry, body temperature and peak expiratory flow monitoring to identify 369 robust predictors of hospitalization. 370 Finally, the system validation was performed in subjects from a Brazilian 371 population at a single practice site, which affects the study's generalizability. Therefore, 372 multicenter studies are necessary in the future to expand the generalizability of these 373 findings. The study used broad inclusion criteria and was performed in a typical setting 374 under usual clinical procedures, which enhanced its generalizability. 375 376 Conclusion 377 An emergency system for home monitoring of SpO2, body temperature and PEF in 378 patients with COVID-19 was developed in the current study. This was the first study to 379 propose such a system and to evaluate the use of PEF in COVID-19. Using this system, 380 the acquisition and analysis of the cited signals can be performed remotely through the 381Internet. The ability of the system to detect abnormal events was initially validated by a 382 30-day monitoring study in normal subjects and patients with COVID-19. In close 383 agreement with previous results and physiological fundamentals, the presence of COVID-384 19 resulted in reduced values of SpO2, increased BPM, fever events in 41.7% of the 385 patients and decreased PEF in 33% of the studied patients. 386The proposed system may contribute to conserve hospital resources for those most 387 in need, while simultaneously enabling early recognition of patients under acute 388 deterioration, requiring urgent assessment. 389",Brazil,first author,2020-12-11,12
12746de20da7d8fcc5475445e775763f7776f3f9,,"At the end of 2019, a new outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 (a coronavirus) started in Hubei Province, China. The clinical condition, COVID-19, probably arose from natural selection in bat reservoirs [1] . There are currently more than five million cases worldwide, and the pandemic has been increasing exponentially in many countries since the disease was deemed a pandemic by WHO in March 2020 [2] .The lethality rate is influenced by the speed of contagion, idiosyncrasies of the affected populations according to the containment policies adopted, socioeconomic conditions and the absorption limit of the health system [3] . Due to the high rate of transmission of the virus by air and the novelty of the infection to humans, the disease has become a global emergency a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 problem, forcing periods of social confinement to contain the pandemic, in addition to hygiene habits [4] .Although mortality in men is significantly higher [5] , representing an increase from 20% to 70% in European countries, approximately 65% in some Asian countries, and, even more peculiarly, Dominican Republic citizens showed three times more deaths in men than women [2, 6, 7] . It is unknown whether this is due to biological differences between genders, differences in behavioral habits, or comorbidities rates [8] .Studies indicate that cell-virus interaction is mediated by the connection of the transmembrane glycoprotein spike (S), present in the form of trimers on the viral surface, to angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, also called hACE2) [9] .The level and expression pattern of ACE2 in different tissues and cells can be critical to the susceptibility and symptoms resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection [10] . Zhou and collaborators [11] , using scRNA-seq datasets, classified organs vulnerable to infection as high and low risk based on their expression levels of ACE2. At the clinical level, the symptoms of COVID-19 may be related to the entry and affinity of the virus in these organs, as observed in heart failure disease and increased ACE2 expression, in which viral infection is related to a higher risk of heart attack and worse ill condition [12] . For Li and collaborators [13] , ACE2 genetic variations could be crucial to the susceptibility in different cohorts and to clinical outcomes of Currently, investigations of potential genetic variations that may favor or hinder interactions between the virus and the host have been conducted [14] [15] [16] , showing a high number of codons that can, if altered, interfere with the complexity of the virus-cell interaction, as experimentally demonstrated [17] . It is noteworthy that the ACE2 is located on the X chromosome, causing the impossibility of heterozygosity in men. Therefore, polymorphisms in their single copy could be related to the worst outcomes observed in males [18] .Considering the above, we sought explanations for an intrinsic factor that differed between sexes and populations that may justify the differences observed in the incidence and lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the different regions of the world, as well as between sexes. We analyzed global data in the 1000 Genomes Database and, in addition, we conducted studies of exomes in two population groups in the Brazilian Amazon (Indians and miscegenated), without description in public genomic banks, and we compared this information with a public databank from a population in southeastern Brazil. These comparisons are important because Brazil has a continental size and an admixed population in the North (more Amerindians among all regions), Northeast (more Africans), and South and Southeast (more Europeans) [19] .The analysis was performed on data from the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 database (1000G), which comprises 84,4 million variants in 2,504 individuals from 26 different populations [20] . These populations were concentrated in five large groups: African (AFR), Ad Mixed American (AMR), East Asian (EAS), European (EUR), and South Asian (SAS).Through the complete sequence of the X chromosome, a region between nucleotides 15620281 and 15512643 was selected in revision GRCh37.p13 (15602158 and 15494520 in GRCh38.p13) since the angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 gene (ACE2, Gene ID: 59272, updated on 22-Mar-2020) is located on the complementary strand, covering 107639 bp. Additionally, a region of ten thousand base pairs upstream to the gene was included in the analysis so that the initial search site became 15630281 (GRCh37.p13) [20, 21] For the allelic comparison between the populations cataloged in the 1000 Genomes database and the population not described in the respective project, we investigated a population composed of 64 Amerindians and 82 admixed individuals from the Amazon region of northern Brazil (data available at S4 Table) . This study was approved by the National Committee for Ethics in Research (CONEP) and the Research Ethics Committee of the UFPA Tropical Medicine Center under CAAE number 20654313.6.0000.5172. The participants signed an informed consent form. The Amerindians represent 10 different Amazonian ethnic groups that were grouped together as the Native American (NAM) group. Tribe names and geographic coordinates of the Brazilian Amazon Indian populations are presented in S5 Table. Compared with other Native Americans (from different countries and even different regions of Brazil), the Amazonian indigenous groups are similar to each other. Commonly, there are quite differences between distinct ethnic groups of native Americans. However, in comparison to populations of other ancestry backgrounds (Europeans or Africans), the Native Americans of the Brazilian Amazon may be grouped as a homogeneous population [22] [23] [24] .The 82 admixed individuals (Brazilian Admixed Population-BAP) live in Belém city, located in northern Brazil, where, due to the colonization process, are characterized by three ancestral genetic components: European, Native American and African. This sample group is also enrolled in a broad project. Furthermore, we also compared our findings to a database of variants analyzed in a Southeast Brazilian population, the Online Archive of Brazilian Mutations (ABraOM, we represent here as ABM) [25] .The Brazilian population is one of the populations with the broadest genetic diversity in the world due to the high degree of miscegenation in its formation [26] [27] [28] . Different regions of Brazil have significant genetic variations in the contribution of their ancestry. The population of southeastern Brazil, which forms the ABM database, has a high contribution from European ancestors [29] . Our data (BAP) were generated based on the population of Northern Brazil of formation with high Amerindian ancestry, resulting in relevant genetic differences between regions [30] .The DNA was extracted as described by Sambrook and collaborators [31] . The genetic material was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA). The libraries were prepared using the Nextera Rapid Capture Exome (Illumina) and SureSelect Human All Exon V6 (Agilent) Kits. Sequencing reactions were run using the NextSeq 500 High-output v2 300 Cycle Kit (Illumina1, USA) on the NextSeq 5001 platform (Illumina1, USA).The quality of the FASTQ reads was analyzed (FastQC v.0.11-http://www.bioinformatics. babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), and the samples were filtered to eliminate low-quality readings (fastx_tools v.0.13 -http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/). The sequences were aligned with the reference genome (GRCh37) using the BWA v.0.7 tool (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge. net/). The file was indexed and sorted (SAMtools v.1.2 -http://sourceforge.net/projects/ samtools/). Subsequently, the alignment was processed (duplicate PCR removal) (Picard Tools v.1.129 -http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/), and mapping quality recalibration and local realignment (GATK v.3.2 -https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) were performed. The results were processed to determine the variants (GATK v.3.2) from the reference genome. SnpEff v.4.3t, Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (Ensembl release 99) and ClinVar (v.2018-10) were used for variant annotations.Information from the databank and exomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics, considering the values of allele frequencies of populations and subpopulations as the data explored comparatively. Genotypic differences between sexes in the homo/hemizygous state were calculated based on the premise that populations are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.Analyzing the polymorphisms contained in the ACE2 locus, in addition to ten thousand base pairs upstream, we found 2266 polymorphisms, of which 199 were contained in the region 5ú pstream of the gene, 85 were located in exonic regions, and the others were located in the introns.In the exonic region, 15 SNPs of the 85 polymorphisms found in 1000G present differences greater than 1% between some of the populations (all between exons 17 to 21). Another three polymorphisms (rs889263894, rs1027571965, rs147464721) appear mainly in the Brazilian population. Nine of these exonic polymorphisms are present in the most common isomorphs (v1 and v2) and show important differences in populational frequency (Fig 1, additional data on S1 Table) .As noted, some of these polymorphisms have very significant differences between MAFs from different populations. rs35803318 is absent in Asians (virtually absent in AFR) and has an average MAF of 0.05 in EUR and ABM, increased to 0.074 in BAP, and has the highest allele frequency in the indigenous population among all populations (MAF = 0.121).On the other hand, rs4646179 is absent in indigenous, miscegenated people from the Amazon, Asians and Europeans and is found in the population of southeastern Brazil and Americans, with a MAF = 0.023 and an even greater frequency in Africans (MAF = 0.074).Interestingly, rs1027571965 and rs889263894 presented allele frequencies exclusively in indigenous people and are not being found in any other world population of 1000G, neither in BAP nor in the Brazilian ABM database, with MAF = 0.095 and 0.034, respectively. rs147464721 has MAF = 0.014 in the miscegenated population of the Amazon (BAP); however, they did not present any allelic frequency among the indigenous population, as well as in Asians and Europeans, presenting a slightly lower MAF difference when compared to AFR and AMR.Differences greater than 1% of MAF in the region 10,000 base pairs 5´upstream to the gene were observed in 57 polymorphisms (Fig 2) . It is also worth mentioning that the rs2097723 SNP presents a very heterogeneous distribution, oscillating between 7% in Africans, 32% in Americans, 42% in East Asians, 28% in Europeans and 22% in South Asians.In intronic polymorphisms, many of them present a very relevant MAF interpopulational difference (up to 0.46). Two of them deserve to be highlighted, rs2285666 and rs4646140, because they are near exons.It is important to mention that rs2285666 has the highest frequency of the rarest allele (MAF = 0.71) in the indigenous population, with very important MAF differences of 0.17 (EAS), 0.23 (SAS), 0.36 (BAP), and 0.37 (AMR) and an average difference of 0.48 for the others (EUR, AFR and ABM). In contrast, rs4646140 has a MAF ranging from zero in Indians to 0.13 in Africans through EUR, AMR, BAP, EAS, ABM and SAS (Fig 3) . Furthermore, considering the possibility of influence in determining isoforms v2, it is worth noting rs190614788 on intron 1 (with a difference of more than 0.11 between EUR and EAS).The main findings of our study are concatenated in Table 1 (additional information in S3  Table) , and they are discussed below.Considering the regions where the virus commonly binds to ACE2 [15, 16] , our results point to the absence of relevant polymorphisms at these sites because many of those located in coding regions have MAFs close to or less than 0.001, as well as a very low possibility of conferring any global (or population) impact on the destination of the disease. Therefore, there does not seem to be any direct mechanism (at the sites of interaction) that could confer some form of resistance or greater propensity to contagion in humans. In view of this finding, other molecular modifications with potential functional repercussions were investigated, including 1) changes in sites distant to the viral binding locus, but which may bring about some structural protein change with the potential to influence the cell-virus interaction; 2) changes in translation regulation regions at 3´UTR sites, at points of interaction with miRNA; and 3) modifications in transcription regulation zones in 5´upstream regions and intragenic promoters. The ACE2 gene is mainly composed of two isoforms with 18 or 19 exons (v1 and v2) that encode the same protein (805 amino acids) and three other smaller variants: x1, x2 and x3, which have rarely been studied [21, 33] . Thus, we searched for genotypic information in these exons that could allow us to infer a disruption with the potential to culminate in impacts on the disease process.Fifteen SNPs showed MAF differences greater than 1% among the studied populations, mainly belonging to exons 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21; the last two are terminal exons belonging only to rare isoforms [21] .Among these, rs41303171 is a missense SNP, causing the replacement of an asparagine (neutral amino acid) with aspartic acid (electronegative amino acid) at codon 720, which can culminate in a conformational disorder of this protein that, directly or indirectly, can change viral interactions. This polymorphic variant C is practically exclusive to Europeans (MAF = 0.018), a fact corroborated by Cao and collaborators [10] , mainly in British individuals (MAF = 0.03). Across Asia, this allele is not found, and is only present in a single Asian resident of the UK [20] . In Brazil, ABraOM data point to MAF<0.01. Thus, the possible biological implications of this change may have some clinical-epidemiological consequences in a small niche of European patients with COVID-19 when compared to other regions of the world.The change from leucine to phenylalanine in codon 731 (rs147311723) results in the exchange of two nonpolar amino acids that are structurally different (with the presence of an aromatic ring in this last), which may culminate in functional modifications in the ACE2 protein, with the prediction that this will occur equally to 0.941, according to the PolyPhen algorithm [32] . This polymorphism is absent in Asians and Europeans, with low frequency in Americans and Southeast Brazilians, and it has MAF = 0.017 in Africans, mainly in Nigerians, with MAF = 0.043 of allele A. In a study by Cao and colleagues [10] , this polymorphism was described as a low frequency SNP in the 1000G database, but without any mention in the China Metabolic Analysis Project (ChinaMAP) database, reinforcing its absence in this population group.In a context focused on the Brazilian Amazon, unprecedented data showed the presence of two SNPs absent in all populations of the 1000G. One of them is rs1027571965, which is characterized by an exchange of G>C in exon 16, leading to a substitution of alanine for glycine at codon 673 (MAF = 0.095), and the other, rs889263894, an exchange of T>A in exon 13 (MAF = 0.034), causing an alteration of lysine to isoleucine in codon 541; thus, this last SNP should cause structural differences by the exchange of a polar and electropositive amino acid with a hydrophobic amino acid, possibly resulting in functional changes in ACE2, with a probability of 0.958 that this event will occur [32] . Both SNPs had uncertain significance until now.It is also noteworthy that in codons 351 (rs147464721), 690 (rs4646179) and 749 (rs35803318), there are just synonymous alterations, without any study of modifications of this enzyme in a genotype-dependent manner.Our data point to a series of polymorphisms in the region upstream of the ACE2 gene, which oscillate markedly among populations and, therefore, in individuals, although some of them may not have relevant frequency at a global level. Among them, there are rs2097723 and rs5934250, with population allele differences of up to 0.35 and 0.47, respectively.The lower frequency allele (C) of rs2097723 has a normalized effect size (NES) of up to 0.36 [34] for increased expression of the ACE gene in brain tissue. The T allele of rs5934250 has an NES of 0.64 for lower ACE2 expression in this tissue, among others [34] . Thus, when looking at population data, it can be inferred that, according to these two variants, populations in East Asia would have the most related scenario regarding increased gene expression. Europeans or Africans have a lower frequency of ACE2 higher-expression-related SNPs in the pre-genic region.Another interesting observation involves the exon 19 polymorphisms, which are contained in the 3´UTR region of the two most important isoforms, the canonical miRNA binding site for translation control dependent on this epigenetic mechanism [21, 35] . In this regard, observing the regions of interaction between the miRNA and nucleotide exchange sites, it can be noted that rs182366225 is included in the site of attachment to the seed region of miR-140-3p.1 and miR-483-3p.2, both with a match of 7mer-1A and Context ++ score percentile of 90 and 74, respectively. Thus, the proportion of translation regulation that depends on these miR-NAs will be upregulated in the East Asian population, especially in Vietnamese and Chinese individuals, who have an average MAF of 0.032 of the C allele, which is not observed in any other population in the world [36] . A reporter assay for miR-483-3p predicted targets by Kemp and collaborators [37] showed that the regulation of ACE2 is dependent on this microRNA.The rs142017934 site includes the connection site for miR-610 and miR-3646, both with 8mer of match in ACE2 (context ++ score percentile of 98 and 77, respectively), in addition to the seed regions of miR-3609 and miR-548ah-5p, both with a match of 7mer-m8 and scores of 84 and 74, respectively [35] . This polymorphism occurs exclusively in the population of African origin (MAF = 0.013), mainly in Nigerians and individuals from Barbados with African ethnicity, with an average of MAF = 0.026. This higher frequency among people of African ethnicity residing on different continents is probably due to the strong population ancestry of Barbados being from West Africa, a region containing Nigeria [38] .Among the intronic polymorphisms, rs2285666 draws much attention because it presents the highest frequency of the rarest allele (MAF = 0.71) in the indigenous population, with differences ranging from 0.48 to 0.17 for the other populations, with the Asians being the most similar to the Indians, mainly the Chinese. The high MAF observed in the Chinese population in the present study corroborates the data of Cao and collaborators [10] using the ChinaMAP database. The substitution of C for T in intron 4, to only four nucleotides of exon 3 (located in the splicing region), influences the gene expression in brain tissues and tibial nerve in some way so that the T allele is related to a significant increase in the expression of ACE2 [34] , thus may be a determinant in clinical differences in this naturally more vulnerable population.Another intronic polymorphism, rs4646140, has no MAF in the indigenous population, reaching 0.13 in Africans, mainly in Nigerians (0.17). Some studies show the influence of these two intronic SNPs with hypertension [39, 40] , since there is a possibility that they will interfere in the ACE2 protein product.In conclusion, considering this genetic aspect involving ACE2 in the complex relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and humans, we emphasize the following:There are genetic markers that influence in ACE2 alterations and potentially to the unequal rates of aggravation and death observed between men and women. If considering some of the polymorphisms as harmful when in homozygosity (genotypic frequency equal to allelic frequency squared) or hemizygosity (genotypic frequency equal to allelic frequency), men would have this conditions from 1�4 to 77 times more (uniallelic) than women (Table 1) . Thus, a relevant contribution to the understanding of higher mortality in males is presented, as reported in the various populations affected by COVID-19.The rates of contagion and death fluctuate greatly; in this sense, ACE2 polymorphisms could contribute to these differences. The rs182366225 and rs2097723 polymorphisms that potentially may increase the expression of the ACE2 are more frequent in the East Asian population. These allele frequencies are even higher in Chinese and Vietnamese populations. Such markers are on the order of 30% to 180% more frequently in East Asians than in other populations.Indigenous populations from Amazon have exclusive genetic polymorphisms (rs1027571965 and rs889263894) or with higher frequencies (rs2285666 and rs35803318) than other populations. These polymorphisms are related to increased expression of the ACE2 gene in brain tissues, among others. As supported previously [10] [11] [12] , this is a relevant finding because they can input some influence on the outcome in these populations, whose involvement by COVID-19 was recently reported. This population group, due to its genetic peculiarity and less previous exposure to viral infections, represents a major challenge in understanding and handling this pandemic.Africans have higher rates of three relevant polymorphisms (rs147311723, rs142017934 and rs4646140). Polymorphism in rs142017934 is exclusive to this population and can influence the translation regulation of the ACE2 gene, thus enhancing the expression of this gene in individuals who carry this variant. However, Europeans and some Africans have a higher frequency of an allele (rs5934250) that seems to reduce the expression of ACE2 in some tissues.Therefore, the study highlights the importance of considering this genetic factor as facilitating or restricting infection and, especially, in potential clinical manifestations and outcomes. Investigation of these polymorphisms in patients affected by COVID-19, with different clinical conditions and outcomes, could potentially advance our understanding of this pandemic disease.Supporting information S1 Table.

45a49381fe95f742be05264ef57c177dbd50b50d,Cross-border COVID-19 spread amidst malaria re-emergence in Venezuela: a human rights analysis,"There is a growing recognition that the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela has unleashed a regional public health threat and a governance problem for Latin America [1] . Challenges related to the deteriorating Venezuelan public health system include the lack of: i) public health investment; ii) adequate health systems and disease control programs; iii) centralized epidemiologic information; and iv) protection of basic human rights for populations. Over the past few years, Venezuela has seen the unraveling of its government and health infrastructure. The censorship of epidemiologic surveillance data and persecution of health professionals, added to the scarcity of investment, has produced a dire situation for the population. Economic sanctions imposed by the United States and other nations have further restricted and undermined the health sectors capacity. In a context of intensifying governance and public health crisis and emergency, the re-emergence of once eliminated diseases like malaria and the massive outward migration of Venezuelans to neighboring countries has created major health systems challenges for the containment of cross-border disease spread, including the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. This has made the need for a global cooperation effort clear.The aim of this paper is to discuss human rights-related factors of co-occurring malaria and COVID-19 epidemics in Venezuela, its border regions and neighboring countries to analyze potential ways forward. Bridging epidemiologic studies and human rights sources, we present two sets of analyses. The first addresses how the lack of governance and public health infrastructure have caused a health systems collapse that has permitted previously preventable diseases that were eliminated/controlled to re-emerge in Venezuela, particularly affecting historically underserved populations. This analysis includes a discussion of how massive migration caused by a concurrent economic and humanitarian crisis poses health systems threats to neighboring countries in Latin America [2] [3] [4] . The second analysis draws on human rights documents, standards and studies to discuss how the public health emergency results from and causes human rights violations within Venezuela, particularly to already underserved communities like indigenous groups [5] . These analyses provide an opportunity to understand how epidemiologic threats in cross-border contexts relate to human rights violations and the role and limits of global governance in response.As of mid-November 2020, Venezuela has reported more than 95,750 cases and 830 deaths of COVID-19 [6, 7] . It is likely these numbers are significant underestimates due to a lack of testing kits, supplies and the broken health infrastructure the country currently experiences [1] . Neighboring and near-by countries report vastly more cases. For example, Colombia has more than 1 million cases [8] and maintains a closed border policy with Venezuela and internal restrictions on social activities with hot spots-based quarantine measures. Perú has nearly as many cases and Brazil ranks third worldwide with more than 5,750,000 cases [9] . The situation is especially dire in the jungleborder regions that these Andean countries share, which are characterized by impoverished communities and limited health infrastructure [9] .The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated ongoing economic and political collapse in Venezuela [1] , and compounds the challenges facing public health institutions from cuts in funding and corruption [10] resulting in shortages of medicines, medical personnel, health care supplies and basic infrastructure [11, 12] . Hospitals throughout Venezuela have reported water and electricity shortages that have severely hindered medical procedures and treatments [1, 13, 14] . In the last 5 years, Venezuela has seen both the re-emergence and an increased rate of infectious [3, 15] , vector-borne [16, 17] , vaccine-preventable [18] and neglected tropical diseases due to this crisis [19] ; which has also affected neighboring countries and the region [15] . These health systems challenges to tackle diseases, are the same that the country now faces to deal with the spread of COVID-19.The population health impact has been substantial. Venezuelans have reported losing 11 kgs. (24.2 pounds) on average of weight; maternal and child health indicators have worsened [20, 21] , including maternal and child mortality [10] ; and already vulnerable populations -mainly children, women, indigenous communities, the elderly and people suffering from pre-existing mental or physical health conditions and disabilities-have seen measures of quality of life worsen [22] . Furthermore, there is a lack of access to cancer medications and antiretroviral therapies for people living with HIV [1] , with Venezuela being the only ""middle-income country"" country in the world were HIV therapies have been interrupted [23, 24] . These issues increase the population's vulnerability to malaria and exacerbate risk factors for COVID-19 related to comorbidities, access to resources and care.There are repeated water shortages in Venezuela [1, 12, 22] , and it is estimated that nearly 80% of the population does not have continuous access to clean drinking water and basic sanitation [25] . Due to growing inflation, which is expected to reach 52, 000% this last quarter of 2020 [26] and economic sanctions enforced by the United States and other countries [22] , the public health situation continues to worsen as the government struggles with lack of public investment or funds to cover State debt [27] . Venezuela is now the poorest country in the Americas, and 96% of Venezuelan live in poverty [28] . Lack of sanitation conditions not only hinders vector control but also affects hygiene and cleaning practices necessary to stop the spread of COVID-19.The collapse of Venezuela's health infrastructure and deterioration of disease control programs has impacts on the region. The re-emergence of vector-borne and infectious diseases threatens neighboring countries as Venezuelan migrants and refugees that had fled the country are now returning as a result of quarantines in other countries and economic insecurity [29, 30] . Public health experts have started to warn about the potential syndemic [31] that could take place -if it has not already-due to convergence of increased numbers of dengue, malaria and measles [32] cases, the hindered immunization strategies due to the pandemic [33] , the lack of HIV medications available [1] , massive migration out and inward, and the immense human and economic costs that COVID-19 could bring to the region [1] .Malaria is a vector-borne parasitic infection caused by several species of Plasmodium parasites and transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes [2, 34] . Malaria can be prevented, and effectively treated with medicines included on the WHO's list of ""essential medicines"" [34, 35] . In South America, malaria is most prevalent in the Amazon region (shared by Brazil, Perú, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, French Guyana, Surinam, Venezuela and Colombia) [2] . Worldwide, in 2018, there were > 400,000 deaths of malaria, of which children account for roughly half [30] .Through a strategy of vector control and active case surveillance and response, malaria was eliminated in Venezuela in 1961 [36] . In Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil malaria control efforts are ongoing, with each country pursuing elimination [2] . Although Venezuela was the first WHO-certified country in Latin America to eliminate malaria in its most populated areas [36] , the lack of vector control and surveillance in the last several years has resulted in the infection being reintroduced to formerly malaria-free areas, mainly in the Bolívar state in the South east corner of the country [37] . Cases of malaria from Venezuela have also been recorded in neighboring countries, accounting for 30% of new cases of malaria in the region in 2016 [36] and more than 50% of cases in 2017 [38, 39] . In 2018, the shared border region between Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela accounted for 80% of all malaria cases in the Americas; for which Venezuelan cases again represented more than half of all cases [38] .Malaria vulnerability is greater in populations that inhabit tropical and/or jungle areas in the region including among indigenous tribes; riverine, miners and fishing communities; as well as Afro communities relegated to isolated parts of Andean countries due to poverty and institutional racism [36] . In Venezuela, the risk of getting malaria escalates given the lack of vector control (fumigation, insecticide sprayed sleeping nets, indoor spraying and distribution of malaria prophylaxis medications) and barriers to access healthcare [38] . Additional factors that can be contributing to the epidemic relate to lack of testing, care and available medications for the ill, asymptomatic infections, peri-urban malaria, illegal gold mining-related malaria, malaria in pregnancy and possible under-detection; as well as lack of investment in public health infrastructure that supports preventive efforts and discontinuity of previously conducted elimination and eradication programs [2, 36] . While the Venezuelan government last published data on the incidence of malaria in the country in 2007, reports from international organizations and local clinics suggest high incidence [36] . Today, the country ranks first in malaria cases for the Americas, well over countries like Haiti, which have historically recorded high incidence of malaria [38] .The COVID-19 pandemic has made the situation in border zones even more challenging for malaria control efforts. Venezuelan migrants and refugees facing lockdowns, quarantine measures and even more scarce health resources as a result of the pandemic, could increase malaria transmission as they are forced to return to Venezuela and migrate again, often being held up in different cross border points for extended periods of time [29, 30] . Individuals with malaria needing care at home or in health care settings could also be at increased risk for COVID-19, and as Venezuelans seek to return to their country and/or get stuck along migratory routes, the potential importation and transport of coronavirus cases could be especially devastating given the country's lack of infrastructure and public health system to care for patients [1, 12] . [46] . It is further articulated in General Comment 14 [47] of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which identifies social determinants of health as fundamental to the realization of the right to the highest attainable standard of health, including the right to clean water, the right to a healthy environment (like clean air, healthy environments and protection from toxic wastes), food, housing and jobs.Realization of the right to health [41, 47] in Venezuela has been hindered by the government's failure to take action to prevent vector-borne diseases like malaria, and now infectious diseases like COVID-19. In comparison with neighboring countries, Venezuelans are more likely to die from malaria and to arrive to the hospital with complication due to malnutrition [22] and health care in Venezuela has become progressively less available, accessibly, acceptable and of high quality. Health facilities commonly lack the necessary supplies and/or medicines to provide treatment, lack health personnel, and even basic provisions [11, 12, 22, 48] . This situation is worse for people living with disabilities, children, pregnant women and indigenous communities [4, 11] .Examining the actions, and inactions, of the Venezuelan government with respect to malaria and COVID-19, it is clear that they are failing to uphold their human rights obligations, both in terms of the overall population and in terms of populations subjects of special protection such as children, pregnant women, people living with disabilities, and indigenous communities [49] . This includes taking the necessary measures to reduce child morbidity and mortality, the prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases and the creation of conditions which would assure access to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness -all of which are aspects of the right to health as conceptualized in international human rights law as well domestic laws and Constitutional protection. The Venezuelan government's failure to implement disease control measures, to collect and report epidemiological surveillance data and to cooperate with its neighboring countries to address the regional spread of infectious disease threats also entails a failure to uphold the WHO International Health Regulations [50] . Table 1 summarizes relevant human rights related to the re-emergence of malaria, COVID-19 and the government's obligations from both international treaties and Constitutional protections.Case study: Venezuela's indigenous communities Bolívar State, with a high concentration of illegal gold mines, accounted for 74% of Venezuela's malaria in 2016 -the highest incidence in the Americas [51] . Illegal gold mining affects ecosystems as it involves vast deforestation and contamination of food and water sources, which favors mosquito proliferation [36] . The increase in malaria incidence has been associated with these human activities and the massive migration to these areas of people looking for jobs [52] ; but also to the conditions in which miners work, being overexposed to long Granted to groups that have been historically and/or socially discriminated against periods outside and pressured to live in camps where living conditions lack sanitary standards of health and protection (complete walls, mosquito nets, roof protection) [36, 51] . This violates their rights to work and housing as understood in international human rights law (ICESC, Arts. 6,7; CEAFRD, Art. 5 (e.i)). The Venezuelan State has neglected to take effective measures that ensure the protection of the environment and the disposal of hazardous materials derived from mining, which greatly harms indigenous communities in the area [53] , violating their right to a clean environment and the protection of its resources according to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People and the Venezuelan Constitution [54] . Expansion of endemic transmission from Zulia to Mérida is also due to domestic massive migration patterns that spread the disease to areas of chronic under-investment in public health in the Southeast of the country [52] . Indigenous people have repeatedly denounced the exploitation and detrimental impact that mining has on their territories, bringing settlers into their land, increasing disease infection rates and exposing their communities, particularly women and children, to sexual and labor exploitation [55, 56] . COVID-19 aggravates this situation, which is compounded by the lack of efforts to prepare for or address the crisis, especially in the Amazon and Amazon-adjacent areas [9] . In addition to illegal mining, Bolívar state, has high levels of drug and human trafficking, sexual exploitation and illegal guerrilla activities involving training, children's forced recruitment and labor exploitation under arbitrarily declared 'war laws' [5] . The scarcity of health infrastructure is also exacerbated by the lack of occupational health care arising from illegal labor [5] . Lack of information on malaria prevention and treatment for indigenous populations also contribute to poor health outcomes and represents failures of the government to uphold human rights obligations [17] .Indigenous communities were recognized by the Venezuelan government as part of the country in the 1999 Constitution (see Table 1 ) and Venezuela proclaimed itself a multicultural nation [54] . However, the government has historically protected private companies and investors that exploit natural resources in Amazonadjacent and border territories, infringing indigenous people's rights to land, resources and protection, and failing to uphold human rights obligations related to the right to a healthy environment. Under the guise of responding to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rights of indigenous communities in Venezuela could be further threatened, as has been the case in Brazil, where the country's President, Jair Bolsonaro, has stripped the Amazon and the indigenous communities of constitutional protections that protect them, their land and the ecosystem [57, 58] . In Venezuela, mining companies operate under the protection of the army, which is suspected to take a part of the royalties in exchange for services provided [5] . Human rights and international organizations have documented how indigenous women are forced into prostitution by mining activities and further exposed to violence under territory disputes between armed illegal actors [55, 56] . These communities are often forced to flee in search of protection, which causes them to seek refuge outside of their ancestral land in neighboring countries, potentially exacerbating vulnerability to infection and the spread of disease.The Venezuelan State has neglected to take effective measures that ensure the protection of the environment, of groups of special protection and of the general population; and avoided confrontation with mining activities, illegal guerrillas and gangs that enforce armed control [5] . The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights declared in September 2020 that the government was complicit with censorship, repression of peaceful protests, forced disappearances, politically motivated detention and torture, extrajudicial executions and a compromised judiciary, with a system that fails to serve as a check on other State actors [59] . These rights violations can directly impact health, at an individual and population level [60] .The Venezuelan government's rights obligations can be understood both in terms of its failure to implement what is required under international treaties and conventions (positive obligations), but also in the purposeful actions that it is actively taking to censor and suppress access to information on the spread of malaria and COVID (negative obligations) [51] . By allowing the public health system to collapse under lack of funding and protection, but also by permitting illegal activities under its jurisdiction like mining and guerrilla presence [5] , the Venezuelan government is violating its own Constitution and is failing to ensure Venezuelans in general, and children's, women's, indigenous communities' rights in particular, including the rights to life and health.This failure to control malaria and prevent its reemergence is caused by the lack of availability, quality, accessibility and acceptability of healthcare institutions, health personnel, health facilities, supplies and trustworthy public epidemiologic information. The government of Venezuela does not support the life, development, nondiscrimination, work, housing, environment and highest attainable standard of health of its populations and the lack of implementation of malaria prevention strategies as defined by the WHO, the United Nations and its own domestic laws. The right to health, as stated in international conventions, the ICESCR and General Comment 14, incentivizes cooperation and support on the part of the international community to progressively achieve its full realization if necessary or required. Malaria re-emergence and its convergence with the COVID-19 pandemic, as presented here, should be dealt with internationally as it has the potential to impact other nation's subjects of special protection and refers to a population that is currently undergoing a humanitarian crisis and a global pandemic.The necessary measures to protect human rights, particularly to ensure the right to health, must include cooperation with international funders and agencies to support public health infrastructure, medicines, supplies and personnel that have been turned down by the Venezuelan government in the past. Disclosure of public health surveillance data is paramount in order to assess and intervene syndemic situations relating to malaria and the COVID-19 pandemic. International organizations and local clinics on the ground have been critical in reporting incidence, trends and spread of malaria [36] , and can once again contribute to assess, based on more realistic numbers, the COVID-19 situation within Venezuela without fear of being persecuted, censored and/or closed. Consequently, the right to information is central to protect the right to health in this context.Ensuring the protection of the right to health and other human rights in Venezuela requires international agencies and non-governmental organizations to support efforts within Venezuela and in neighboring countries and border regions to expand the provision of healthcare and medicine distribution for Venezuelans, border dwellers and migrants/refugees in these areas; particularly for indigenous populations in the Amazon and Amazon-adjacent territories that are being disproportionally affected by COVID-19 and factors impacting human rights. Given the restrictions of information concerning malaria, expanded efforts are needed too to ensure that accurate estimates of COVID-19 cases are reported from the country. Protection of medical personnel, which has been heavily repressed in the past must be a goal of international cooperation and a focus on the extra-territorial principle of the responsibility to protect of the international community while dealing with COVID-19 control strategies in the area.The continuity and commonality between the claims in human rights abuses denounced has increased international pressure since the crisis in Venezuela was first declared in 2016. International traction gained by the United Nations and different international human rights platforms [61, 62] and international cooperation agencies -including the UN Human Rights report on Venezuela to take immediate measures to halt and remedy grave rights violations in 2020 [63] has been useful to promote COVID-19 responses in Venezuela [64, 65] . The Pan American Health Organization, the WHO, UNHCR and OCHA have all been instrumental in coordinating important diplomatic actions to enforce the Right to Protect through support to neighboring nations, fund raising and supply distribution [64, 66, 67] . These actions, however, will be hindered if economic sanctions enforced by the United States are not lifted and Venezuela lacks economic capacity to maneuver. Infrastructure investments are needed in Venezuela to articulate coordinated responses both within and in tandem with the international community. The pictures, reports, research and interventions on the massive migratory flows leaving Venezuela (and now in transit or returning due to pandemic-associated measures in countries in the region) have created momentum to expose the suffering of Venezuelans and create awareness of the situation on international platforms.The response of countries like Colombia, which has included Venezuelan migrants/refugees in its response to COVID-19 [68] , will not be enough without a global support and action from Global North funding and cooperation, including U.S. agencies. Actions to promote change should focus on containment of vector-borne, vaccine-preventable, neglected diseases and human rights. Surveillance, monitoring and prevention of the development of the public health crises caused by human rights abuses and syndemic effects with infectious diseases can increase grave human rights violations and cause grave health effect for populations and generations to come.

187af41213f69f3ff1b9c36b48ec36779a8e73ee,Subarachnoid hemorrhage and COVID-19 Association or coincidence?,"In December 2019, the virus named SARS-CoV-2 was identified in Wuhan, China, after an outbreak of unexplained pneumonia cases. In February 2020, this disease was defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as coronavirus disease 2019 . [1] [2] [3] Since the outbreak of the epidemic in Wuhan, China, [4, 5] it has spread rapidly across the world, with more than 6.931.000 confirmed cases and 400.850 deaths worldwide to date. [6] It is known that clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 have shown a wide spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic infections, mild respiratory tract disease and severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and associated risk of death. [7] Several studies have described some of the most common symptoms of COVID-19 infection, including fever, cough, diarrhea, fatigue and predominantly respiratory symptoms. [8] However, observational studies have suggested the involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Neurological symptoms have been already reported, such as headache, dizziness, hypogeusia, hyposmia. More severe neurological conditions are also observed, such as stroke and vascular events, impairment of consciousness or encephalopathy, seizures, Guillain-Barré syndrome and peripheral nerve disorders. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] However, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 is primarily neurotropic and responsible for neurological damage, or whether these symptoms are attributed to secondary mechanisms. [12, 13, 14] In addition, intracranial hemorrhages have rarely been reported to date. In this study, we aim to describe the clinical aspects as well as the treatment and the outcomes of 4 rare cases of acute spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), in patients infected with COVID-19. In 1 case, there was an association with inter-hemispheric acute subdural hemorrhage (IHSDH) Therefore, in the light of our knowledge, this is the largest case series to date of spontaneous SAH related to SARS-CoV-2. Finally, a question that arises is: according to the recent pandemic by COVID 19, would SHA in that context be an association or coincidence?We conducted a retrospective case series of 4 patients who developed sudden spontaneous SAH during SARS-CoV-2 infection, from a comprehensive neurological center, in Recife, Brazil. It was approved by the local ethics committee of Hospital da Restauração, Recife-Brazil. The patients or family members provided informed consent before participation, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, and neurological data were checked in detail by a team of trained neurosurgeons and neuroradiologists.The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the upper and eventually lower respiratory tract (collected sputum and endotracheal aspirates), according to the recommendations of the WHO. [14] These swab samples were collected and placed into a tube containing preservation solution for the virus. SAH diagnosis was performed by cranial CT-scan (measured using the Fisher scale [4] ), associated with digital subtraction angiography (DSA), in most cases. In addition, laboratory tests such as coagulation tests, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], LDH and Ddimer) were also performed. Patient outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) [15] at discharge.A 36-year-old woman presented with nausea, cough, fever, anosmia and mild headache for 6 days. There were no reports of comorbidities or previous neurological events. Upon admission to the emergency room, the patient was alert and oriented. His vital signs were stable, and a neurological examination revealed a mild headache and neck stiffness. Body temperature at admission was 37.8°C. Intravenous (IV) antibiotic (ceftriaxone 2 g IV) and antiviral (acyclovir IV) was administered, considering central nervous system (CNS) infection. Due to the report of cough, fever and anosmia in the last 6 days, the hypothesis of infection by the novel coronavirus was raised. Therefore, throat swab samples were collected for 2019-nCoVRNA RT-PCR, which confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2. Initial laboratory tests showed increased CRP (40 mg/dl, n.v <10), LDH (507 IU/L, n.v. 125-220) and D-dimer (4000 mg/L, n.v. <500). Coagulation tests were normal. CSF analysis showed a pleocytosis (100 cells, n.v. <5 cells/ml) with a predominance of polymorphonuclear cells (60%), and a high red blood cell count (1200, n.v. <10 mm 3 ).Within 24 hours, the patient had conscious impairment, requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient was moved to our neurological center and a cranial CT-scan was performed. It showed Fisher grade IV SAH and incipient hydrocephalus were visualized (Fig. 1) . Therefore, EVD (external ventricular drain) implantation was performed. Chest CT-scan demonstrated bilateral ground-glass opacities, suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia (Fig. 2 ). DSA revealed a ruptured saccular aneurysm in communicating segment of right internal carotid artery (ICA), as shown in Figure 3 . No signs of angiographic vasospasm were observed. Balloon-assisted embolization was performed and complete aneurysm occlusion was obtained (Fig. 4) . Patient was discharged for rehabilitation after 28 days, with moderate-severe disability (mRS: 4). A 53-year-old man presented with a sudden-onset headache for 24 hours. He had a report of fever, cough and dyspnea in the last 4 days. Body temperature at admission was 37.6°C. On examination, he was confused, but had no neurological deficits. Clinical and laboratory findings indicated moderate respiratory distress (PaO2 /FiO2 238). Inflammatory blood markers were high (CRP 30, 4 mg/dl, n.v <10; LDH 344 IU/L, 125-220; Ddimer 1134 ng/ml n.v. <500). Coagulation tests were normal.Chest CT-scan demonstrated ground-glass opacities in more than 50% of the pulmonary parenchyma bilaterally. Brain CT-scan showed Fisher III SAH (Fig. 5 ). RT-PCR for 2019-nCoVRNA confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Digital angiography was performed within 24 hours, with no evidence of cerebral aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The patient stayed in the ICU for 7 days, without requiring mechanical ventilation. Patient was discharged home after 3 weeks, with good functional status (mRS = 2).A 61-year-old woman presented with cough, fever, and myalgia for 14 days. On the 15th day, she developed dyspnea and pleuritic pain. Clinical and laboratory evaluation showed moderate respiratory distress (PaO2 /FiO2 191). Chest CT-scan it was suggestive of COVID-19. Laboratorial tests showed increased CRP (56 mg/dl, n.v. <10) and D-dimer (2850 mg/L, n.v. <500).Coagulation tests were normal. On the 7th day of ICU stay (23 days after the onset of respiratory symptoms), the patient presented impairment of consciousness, requiring endotracheal intubation. Cranial CT-scan was performed and showed Fisher grade IV SAH, requiring EVD (Fig. 6 ). Within the first 24 hours, he developed progressive hemodynamic instability and death. Therefore, DSA could not be performed in this case.A 71-year-old woman presented with sudden severe headache associated with right hemiparesis and aphasia for 6 hours. She had fever, cough and myalgia for 7 days. During initial medical care, she had a seizure and a progressive respiratory distress (PaO2 /FiO2: 165), requiring mechanical ventilation. After clinical stabilization, brain and chest CT-scan were performed, showing Fisher III SAH (Fig. 7 ) associated with Acute Interhemispheric Subdural Hemorrhage (IHSDH), and ground Four patients were selected for the study, mostly women (3 females; 1 male). The median age was 55 to 25 years (range 36 À71). COVID-19-related pneumonia was severe in 3 out of 4 cases. All patients required critical care support during hospitalization and showed impairment of consciousness associated with SAH. The most common finding on cranial CT-scan was Fisher IV (50%) and Fisher III (50%) SAH, and one case of IHSDH. Two patients developed hydrocephalus requiring EVD implantation. The mean interval between the onset of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and SAH was 875 days. Three patients underwent DSA, but cerebral aneurysm was seen in only 1 case. One patient was unable to undergo cerebral angiography due to severe clinical condition, followed by death. Thus, a berry aneurysm rupture was identified and treated with coiling. Ground-glass opacities in chest CT-scan were multiple and bilateral in all cases. Inflammatory markers were quite elevated, with an average D-dimer of 2336 mg/L (range 1420-4000) and CPR of 38,35 mg/dl (range 27 À56). Coagulation tests were normal. The outcome was poor in the majority of the patients: 1 died (25%), 2 (50%) remained severely neurologically affected (mRS: 4) and 1 (25%) had slight disability (mRS = 2). Clinical, radiological and laboratory data for all patients are summarized in Table 1 .The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a profound impact on healthcare systems around the world. [16, 17] After several evidences in the literature of a relationship between COVID-19 and cerebrovascular disease, there is an imperative need to define these associations and outcomes. We report the clinical and radiological features of 4 patients confirmed with COVID-19, who developed spontaneous SAH during infection. In 1 case, there was an association with IHSDH.Most patients were elderly females. All patients had severe symptoms of COVID-19 before SAH. In all cases, chest CT-scan showed bilateral ground-glass opacities. However, according to the current evidences, SAH and intracranial hemorrhages (ICH) have been rarely associated with COVID-19. Mao et al [29] reported in a retrospective case series, neurological manifestations of patients with COVID-19 in China. One out of the 214 patients included in the study were noted to have an ICH. Sharifi et al [18] reported a case of intracranial bleed in a 79-year-old man positive for COVID-19, with no previous history of hypertension or use of anticoagulants. In this case, cerebral CT scan showed a massive bleed within the right hemisphere with intraventricular and subarachnoid extension. Morassi et al [19] also shored 2 cases of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute hemorrhagic stroke. Likewise, Li et al reported in detail, in a cohort of patients positive for COVID-19, 1 case with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and 1 with ICH. [20] Poyiadji et al [21] revealed 1 case of acute respiratory symptoms (positive for SARS-CoV-2) with altered mental status and acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalitis. In our case series, patients had neurological symptoms related to SAH an average of 8.75 days after the onset of respiratory symptoms related to COVID-19 infection. All evolved with Fisher III SAH (2 cases cases) and Fisher IV SAH (2 cases). Two cases presented hydrocephalus and required EVD implantation. The possible association and pathophysiology behind the occurrence of SAH in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is still to be determined. There are multiple, not mutually exclusive, and possible mechanisms that may suggest that association. As demonstrated by Tang et al, [22] severe COVID-19 has been related to systemic hyperinflammatory state (cytokine storm) and hyperviscosity. This pro-inflammatory state is associated with vascular injury, including breakdown of collagen and increased permeability of blood-brain barrier (BBB). According to Yeo et al [23] some viruses, such as Influenza A, are able to modulate the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) on the epithelial cell line. Thus, BBB may be disturbed by involvement of systemic elevated MMP-9; that breaks collagen of the arterial walls, in its basal membrane. According to Hackenberg et al [24] elevated turnover rates and instability of arterial collagen are strongly associated with hemodynamic changes and increased risk of SAH, related to intracranial aneurysms. In addition, Qin et al, [25] demonstrated that COVID-19 are capable of induce cytokine storm (hypercytokinemia) leading to elevated systemic inflammation with high levels of mediators, such as IL-1b, IL-6, and TNFa. This may consequently induce vascular injury. [24, 26, 27] This is a retrospective study and no CRP was performed for SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF. This is a limitation of our research. Therefore, we could not determine precisely the invasion of this virus in the central nervous system. Nevertheless, neurological symptoms such as headache, anosmia, seizures and impairment of consciousness were reported in this study. It is not clear whether the novel coronavirus is neurotropic in humans or whether direct neuroinvasion would be plausibly achieved by infection of vascular endothelium. [12] Ding et al [28] demonstrated systemic vasculitis and vasculitis of cerebral venules at the autopsy in a series of patients with COVID-19. According to Wu et al. [29] SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the brain or CSF. Endothelial damage could explain neurologic symptoms of COVID-19, as well as the propensity for cerebral hemorrhagic events. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE II), highly expressed in lung alveolar type 2 cells, is also present in multiple tissues, including heart, kidneys and cerebrovascular endothelial cells. [30, 31, 32] Therefore, it would be rational to suggest that ACE II could be involved in COVID-19 neurovascular infection, leading to autoregulation disruption and episodes of high blood pressure spikes, which could result in arterial wall rupture and SHA or ICH. Following the same reasoning, other etiologies of cerebral vasculitis, such as drug abuse, systemic lupus erythematosus, pregnancy or postpartum period and some infectious processes can also lead to intracranial hemorrhage, as previously reported. [31, 33] In this series of 4 cases, 3 underwent cerebral angiography, and a ruptured cerebral aneurysm was found in only 1 case. DSA Table 1 Clinical and neurological presentations in patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who experienced SAH. showed absence of cerebral aneurysms or AVMs in 2 cases. In one of these cases, however, signs of diffuse vasospasm were seen. It is known that the main etiology of spontaneous SAH is aneurysmal rupture. According to North American data, nontraumatic SAH occurs in 30,000 patients per year and represents 5% of strokes. Due to its high mortality (approximately 45% in the first 30 days), its etiological identification is imperative. [34] However, the incidence of negative DSA in spontaneous SAH has been reported in the literature, ranging from 2% to 24%. [35, 36] In this group of patients, the performance of a new DSA after 3 weeks may not definitively exclude an aneurysm. [37, 38] Iwanaga et al [39] demonstrated in a series of patients with SAH and normal initial angiography, that the repetition of this test revealed an aneurysm in 7 of 10 patients with blood predominantly in the anterior interhemispheric fissure and in 1 of 3 patients with blood mainly in the sylvian fissure. In our study, DSA was negative in 2 of 3 tests performed (33.3% of cases). DSA is the gold standard for the diagnosis of vascular lesions resulting in SAH, with a sensitivity of around 99%. [40, 41] There are some factors that can lead to failure to identify structural lesions in spontaneous SAH. These include blood in cistern hiding the aneurysm, thrombus inside the aneurysmal sac, proximal and distal vasospasm leading to nonfilling of aneurysm, image impairment by the proximity of skull bone, very small aneurysm, hemorrhage from a venous system and a technically inadequate examination of the posterior circulation. [42, 43] In light of the high percentage of negative DSA, the authors of this study raise questions about whether there are different pathophysiological mechanisms that could explain SAH in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, differently from SAH in the general population. We analyzed the frequency of SAH in non-COVID patients between March and May 2020, compared to the same interval in 2019. Although we observed a 39% reduction in the number of patients hospitalized for SAH, we obtained an increase of 112.5% in the number of non-aneurysmatic SAH. Therefore, in the interval analyzed, we detected 34% of negative DSA compared to the same period in 2019 (only 16%). Thus, we observed a marked change in the presentation of this disease.In the patients analyzed in this study, we also observed a marked elevation of serum inflammatory markers, such as Ddimer (which ranged from 1134 to 4000 with an average of 2336) and CRP 3835 mg/dl (range 27 À56). Regarding the clinical outcome, we obtained an average mRS of 4, with 1 death, 2 patients with severe functional disability and 1 case with good functional status. Therefore, taking into account that approximately 40% of deaths related to SARS-CoV-2 are related to vascular complications, we should start to consider this disease as a potential systemic vascular infection and not simply an acute respiratory disorder. [44, 45] Possibly, a better understanding of this virus and its associated pathophysiological mechanisms will aid in the early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of SHA and ICH in infected patients.In summary, the study illustrates a series of 4 rare cases of SHA in patients infected with the novel Coronavirus. However, cerebral aneurysm was identified in only 1 case. The possible mechanisms underlying the involvement of SARSCoV-2 and SHA are yet to be fully understood. To some extent, the influence of an exacerbated systemic inflammatory process caused by this virus may be one of the possible reasons for SHA in these patients. Therefore, SHA may be included in severe neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19. However, further epidemiological/clinical studies are needed to confirm the relationship between COVID-19 infection and SAH. ",Brazil,abstract,2020-12-18,12
396c045611f2156762d1bdd8e7aa952d79409505,"Spatiotemporal ecological study of COVID-19 mortality in the city of São Paulo, Brazil: Shifting of the high mortality risk from areas with the best to those with the worst socio-economic conditions","Mortality owing to coronavirus disease , caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is considered avoidable because some collective and individual measures can help prevent the infection, and appropriate health assistance greatly reduces the mortality risk. Nevertheless, mortality risk varies according to some individual and geographic risk factors, resulting in health inequity observed in several parts worldwide since the beginning of the pandemic [1, 2] . In Brazil, COVID-19 was first reported in the city of São Paulo on 25 February 2020 [3] . Until 3 August, 4 months after the first reported death, the disease had already resulted in 2,962,442 confirmed cases and 99,572 deaths in the country [4] . Currently, the United States of America and Brazil are the epicentres of the disease.Brazil is the fifth country worldwide in terms of surface area and population and is classified as having an upper-middle-income economy [5] . Almost 60% of the Brazilian population is concentrated in 6% of the large cities, among which São Paulo is the largest.The Brazilian Unified Health System guarantees healthcare for all citizens as well as for thousands of foreigners residing or passing through the country [6] . Despite this universal healthcare, geographic differences in mortality rates across different areas have been observed on a national and intra-urban scale. Spatial heterogeneity in population characteristics such as age, underlying health, household densities, partial lack of sanitation, socio-economic status, contact networks, and mobility patterns [7] has emerged as a potential propellant of the spatiotemporal spread of the disease.Since the beginning of the pandemic, mapping disease occurrence and spread has become a powerful tool to track the disease and establish measures to slow down the transmission of the infection both locally and globally [8] . Web-based Geographical Information Systems have allowed near real-time monitoring using map-centric dashboards [9] [10] [11] . Despite advances in the use of technology to reduce the impact of the pandemic, little is known about the spatiotemporal patterns of COVID-19 mortality, especially in intra-urban settings. Studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of mortality instead of the cases may help better evaluate inequity. All health disadvantages accumulated over decades of life, owing to any kind of deprivation, increase the risk of mortality due to COVID-19. The lack of a robust spatiotemporal analysis undermines the comprehension of mitigation strategies to potentialise disease-control efforts. Thus, this study aimed to unveil the spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 mortality in a higher spatial resolution (in the city of São Paulo), considering the socio-economic context of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f population. This approach may shed light on the urgent need for solid evidence on health inequities during the COVID-19 outbreak.This ecological study, based on COVID-19 secondary mortality data, was delineated in the city of São Paulo, state of São Paulo, Brazil ( Figure 1 ). In 2020, the estimated population of this city was 11,869,660 inhabitants, and the mean demographic density was 7,803 inhabitants/km² [12] .When using COVID-19 data, underreporting is always an issue that deserves attention, even for mortality. To minimise the effect of possible sub-notification of deaths, we analysed confirmed and suspected deaths due to COVID-19. Thus, mortality data Suspected deaths were coded as U04.9 (corresponding to severe acute respiratory syndrome).The places of residence of the COVID-19 deaths were geocoded with CEInfo/SMS-SP using its databases and Google Maps API geocoding script (that uses public places as the base map). The resulting geocoded addresses were validated by comparing the road or Zone Improvement Plan (ZIP code), whenever the record was allocated using the original ZIP code. Geocoded data were assigned to the 310 sample areas of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, for which demographic and socio-economic census data are available [13] . We considered these areas as the spatial units in our models ( Figure 1 ). the e-SIC database. It was not necessary to submit this study to an ethics committee because we did not have access to personal data, such as names and addresses. The use of secondary data without personal identification and in a public domain dispenses the need for prior approval from the Ethics Committee on Research with Human Beings (as per Resolution No. 510/2016 of the National Health Council) [16] .We also used the data available in the TabNet and named this information as the ""Tabnet database"". The Tabnet database is an application, available at <https://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/cidade/secretarias/saude/tabnet/>, provided by the Municipal Health Department of São Paulo. It was developed by DataSUS. This application provides free access (to any user) to population databases and to database information systems of SUS (such as the SIM), which is supplied by the Secretariat's Program (PRO-AIM). Through the Tabnet database application, it is possible to perform tabulations and to cross several variables of interest such as EW, sex, age group, and specific cause. The databases are updated periodically. Notably, the data sources of the Tabnet and e-SIC database are SIM. However, only the e-SIC database is subdivided according to sample area.To measure the socio-economic condition of the population, since individual-level data are not available in the mortality database, we used a socio-economic index elaborated for health research. The Socio-economic Index of the Geographic Context for Health Studies (GeoSES) [17] was developed using principal component analysis, starting with 41 variables. The index conceives the socio-economic condition by considering seven parameters based on the theoretical background [18, 19] : education, mobility, poverty, wealth, income, segregation, and deprivation of resources and services. The index was defined on three scales: national, Federative Unit, and intra-municipal. Figure 1 presents GeoSES for the sample areas of the city of São Paulo. It shows that the areas with the best socio-economic conditions (GeoSES equal to or close to 1) are located in the central part of the city and that the socio-economic conditions deteriorate towards the periphery, where they reach the worst levels (GeoSES equal to or close to -1). It has been shown to be useful in studies of mortality due to avoidable causes of deaths in individuals aged 5-74 years due to interventions at the Brazilian health system on a national scale as well as mortality due to circulatory system diseases in the city of São Paulo [17] . This index is publicly available at https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/geoses.We used the information of confirmed (B34.2) and suspected (U04.9) deaths due to COVID-19 available for the entire city of São Paulo from the 11 th to 29 th EWs to calculate the weekly mortality rates of confirmed (B34.2), suspected (U04.9), and total (B34.2 + U04.9) COVID-19 deaths. This was similarly done using the e-SIC database from the 11 th to 12 th EW. We excluded (from the information e-SIC database) COVID-19 deaths that occurred in the 25 th EW because data from this week were incomplete (it was extracted on 18 June 2020, and it contained only part of the 25 th EW information). These rates were obtained by dividing the respective numbers of deaths in each week by the total population of the city and presented as death per 100,000 inhabitants per week. In this sequence, we obtained the mortality rates for confirmed, suspected, and total COVID-19 deaths according to sex and age for the entire period from the 11 th to 12 th EW using the Tabnet and e-SIC databases. The comparisons between the data from these two sources were useful to evaluate the completeness of the data we used for the spatial and spatiotemporal analysis. For the calculation of the mortality rates according to sex and age, we excluded the data without these information.As only one suspected COVID-19 death occurred during the 11 th EW, we restricted our spatial and spatiotemporal analysis from the 12 th to 24 th EW, and spatial or spatiotemporal architecture was considered in all models developed. We first modelled the confirmed and total COVID-19 deaths using spatiotemporal models involving only the intercept and random effects that account for spatial and temporal autocorrelation and the interaction between them. The spatial dependence was modelled considering the Besag-York-Mollié (BYM) model with two components representing the spatially structured and non-structured random effects [20, 21] . These two components were considered independent from one another and followed the parameterisation proposed previously [22] .The temporal dependence was modelled using a non-structured random effect and a structured random effect provided by a random walk autoregressive model of first order (RW1). The interaction between space and time was modelled considering spatial and temporal non-structured random effects [21] .The number of confirmed and total COVID-19 deaths per EW and per sample area was modelled using Poisson and zero-inflated Poisson probability distributions with a latent Gaussian Bayesian model approach. We considered the expected confirmed and total COVID-19 deaths for each EW and for each spatial unit as offsets in these models.The expected deaths were estimated with indirect standardisation, considering the age and sex structure of each sample area and the mortality rates for the entire study period and city. This enabled us to interpret the outcomes of our analysis as relative risks (RR) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f concerning the mortality rates for the entire study period and city. From these models, we obtained the temporal and spatiotemporal RR. Subsequently, we introduced the socioeconomic covariate (GeoSES) in these models and obtained the corresponding RR.Finally, we used a spatial approach to model the confirmed and total COVID-19 death per EW to evaluate the role of the socio-economic covariate in each EW. To this end, we considered spatial models with intercept, BYM spatial random effects, andGeoSES as a covariate. The expected COVID-19 deaths were obtained in a similar way for the spatiotemporal models. We considered the entire city's mortality rates for each EW, and as such, we could interpret the RR of the entire city's mortality rates for each EW.We performed our models in a Bayesian context using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) approach [23] . We selected the best models using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) so that the best-adjusted models were those with lower DIC values [21] . We used non-informative priors for the fixed effects and priors with penalised complexity for the precision parameters of the random effects [22] . We ran our models in the R environment [24] .We found 14,753 confirmed and suspected COVID-19 deaths in the Tabnet database (from EW 11 to 29) and 10,760 in the e-SIC database (from EW 11 to 25) in the city of São Paulo. We excluded 67 deaths from the e-SIC database because they were referent to the 25 th EW, which was not completed when the data were extracted. Accordingly, we were left with 10,693 deaths. Figure 2 shows the mortality rates for COVID-19 for both data sources considering the confirmed, suspected, and total deaths.The curves from the e-SIC database are similar to the curves from the Tabnet database.Both curves have the same data source with different extraction dates, and the differences among these curves in the 23 rd and 24 th EW are related to a delay in the notification of the COVID-19 deaths. Table 1 shows the numbers and mortality rates of confirmed, suspected, and total COVID-19 deaths in the different sex and age groups, obtained from the e-SIC and Tabnet databases (from EW 11 to 24). To build Table 1 , we excluded six deaths with ignored age and three deaths with ignored sex from the 10,693 deaths in the e-SIC database. We excluded six deaths with ignored age and four deaths with ignored sex from the 11,098 deaths in the Tabnet database. We can observe that the mortality was higher in men and that it increased with age, resulting in a mortality rate of 460.9 deaths per 100,000 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f inhabitants (in 14 weeks) for people aged ≥ 60 years. This pattern of increased mortality with increase in age was also observed after making a greater stratification among people aged 60 years or above, as shown in Supplementary Material 1. We present the results of the models with spatiotemporal architecture using only the intercept. Figure 3 shows the temporal RR from the 12 th to 24 th EW. Notable features include the maximum RR, which occurred during the 20 th EW for the total COVID-19deaths and during the 23 rd EW for the confirmed ones during our study period. These results, even adjusted for the temporal autocorrelation, are similar to those presented in Figure 2 . Considering the data presented in Figures 2 and 3 , the apparent pattern of the temporal curves shows a tendency to stabilise. However, a new rise in mortality cannot be ruled out. Figures 4 and 5 show the posterior means of the spatiotemporal RR for the sample areas and EW, respectively, for confirmed and total COVID-19 deaths. Apart from the fact that the RR is greater for the total deaths than for the confirmed ones, the distribution of the RR is similar between them, and it follows the behaviour of the temporal RR. In the first two EWs, the sample areas presented lower values of RR that increased over time.However, this increase occurred with greater intensity in peripheral areas.We also used the spatiotemporal models, considering socio-economic variables (GeoSES). Table 2 shows the spatiotemporal RR and the 95% credibility intervals for GeoSES obtained for the models with confirmed and total COVID-19 deaths. In both models, it is noted that a high socio-economic level protected against the risk of mortality due to COVID-19 throughout the study period. Thus, an increase of one unit in the socioeconomic indicator represented a 25% reduction in the risk of mortality due to COVID-19 (for the model using only confirmed deaths) and a 33% reduction in the risk of dying for the model using total deaths of COVID-19. Moreover, the risk of mortality due to COVID-19 in the sample areas with the best socio-economic conditions (GeoSES close to 1), compared with that in areas with the worst conditions (GeoSES close to -1), was 50% lower for the model with confirmed deaths and 66% lower for the model with total deaths. Finally, we performed the spatial modelling of confirmed and total COVID-19 deaths in the different EWs separately, considering the socio-economic covariate. Figure 6 shows the RR and 95% credibility intervals for GeoSES, with respect to the confirmed and total COVID-19 deaths for each of the EW. We identified a shift in the pattern of the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and socio-economic status over time. The best socioeconomic level presented itself as a risk factor for COVID-19 deaths in the first two EWs in the city of São Paulo. From the 15 th EW, for total deaths, and from the 16 th EW, for confirmed and total deaths, the worst socio-economic condition became a risk factor. Even if some values were not significant, there was a continuous decrease in RR from the 12 th to 17 th EW, followed by its stabilisation.This is the first population-based study on the evolution of the spatiotemporal pattern of COVID-19 mortality in the intra-urban setting of the largest city of Brazil. Using two different datasets, analysing the confirmed and confirmed plus suspected deaths separately, we were able to evaluate how uncertainty would impact the association between the RR and the socio-economic condition. The robust EW models clearly showed when the high risk of death shifted from areas with the best to those with the worst socioeconomic conditions in the city.Our findings showed that the most critical period regarding mortality due to COVID-19 in the city of São Paulo occurred between the 20 th and 23 rd EW, followed by an apparent stabilisation of the temporal trend. However, it is not possible to predict a future scenario. As social distancing measures have been lifted in the city since the 25 th week [25] , this could increase the number of infected people and, consequently, the number of deaths. Although social distancing alone seems insufficient to contain COVID-19, many studies have frequently concluded that it remains a critical component of the outbreak control [26] . It is important to point out that both total deaths and confirmed deaths showed similar spatial patterns in our study, despite their differences. The suspected deaths, on the one hand, need to be treated with caution because they may not be COVID- 19-related and, on the other hand, could be considered as one of the strengths of the study. This is because there is a delay in the confirmation of suspected cases, and consequently, some of the suspected deaths are later confirmed to be COVID-19-related deaths. Furthermore, some of the suspected cases would be considered as confirmed COVID-19-related deaths if the case definition was not strict (as the required test is often not available or is not performed within the appropriate window time). From this perspective, the amplitudes of variation in rates and RR obtained from confirmed and total deaths could be considered as lower and upper limits (or vice versa) for the magnitudes of these measures.The elderly population represents one of the groups that are more prone to COVID-19 in the city of São Paulo. The risk of death was the highest among men aged > 70 years; this is similar to data from China and the United States [27] . Recently, Souza et al. [3] analysed the Brazilian population and found that most COVID-19 deaths were of men and that the most frequent comorbidities were cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Behavioural factors, especially social status, that may prejudice adherence to lockdown measures, have been shown to be potentially crucial in determining susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 [28, 29] . This unequal death ratio in men may be interpreted considering many factors: the comparatively higher prevalence of comorbidities (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease) [30] , higher risk behaviours J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (i.e., smoking and alcohol use), occupational exposure [31] , and sex differences in immune responses [32] . However, there may be other social and behavioural characteristics that favour women as reported in previous studies, which proposed that women are more likely than men to adopt hand hygiene practices [33] and to seek preventive care [34] .The spatial distribution of suspected and confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 in the city of São Paulo shows inequalities, with spatial dependence and positive correlation associated with socio-economic factors of the areas. This is remarkably similar to the results of Maciel et al. [35] . Our findings reveal that the socio-economic condition acts as a protective factor against the risk of mortality due to COVID-19. In the models considering only confirmed deaths and all deaths, an increase of one unit in the socio-economic indicator represented a 25% and 33% decrease in the risk of mortality, respectively. The first observation is that, when considering all deaths, the protective effect of the socioeconomic level is more evident, showing that there must be a higher incidence of suspected deaths in the less favoured areas than in the most favoured areas (in areas with better socio-economic level, confirmation tests for COVID-19 are probably more available).A study conducted by Souza et al. [3] reinforced this finding. They compared the spatial pattern of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory infection with unknown aetiology, with per capita income in the metropolitan region of São Paulo. They found that the COVID-19 cases were more associated with better levels than the latter.They pointed out that the degree of underreporting of COVID-19 cases would increase with a decrease in socio-economic status. Therefore, our results confirmed the association between COVID-19 and human development, pointing out the importance of geographic screening in locations with a potential for transmission of local infectious diseases, as a fundamental aspect to coordinate better actions against the pandemic [35] .The low socio-economic condition levels demonstrate not only the vulnerability of the population but also the difficulties health services face with respect to the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19. This is similar to the overall fragility expected from health services in Brazil [36] and Latin American countries facing the pandemic [37] . Living conditions may also be strongly influenced by low income in different ways, such as residence in poorer neighbourhoods and poorer housing conditions (particularly confined or overcrowded housing) [38] . The latter condition has been demonstrated to be associated with a greater risk of contagion from several other pathogens such asHelicobacter pylori [39] , tuberculosis [40] , or Epstein-Barr virus [41] . Regarding COVID- 19 , studies have shown that occupation is an explicit determinant of contagion and a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f secondary determinant of COVID-19 severity and deaths due to the association between occupational social class and comorbidities [38] . For example, workers such as cleaners, retail staff, teachers, or healthcare workers have a direct impact on COVID-19 incidence [42] . Individuals with underprivileged socio-economic conditions are more prone to be exposed to job stress, including burnout syndrome and unemployment, which may contribute to disrupted immune and inflammatory system responses [43, 44] as well as a higher risk of comorbidities with COVID-19 [45] . Until now, both debilitated immunity and the existence of comorbidities are recognised risk factors for COVID-19 severity [38] .We showed that the first cases of deaths occurred in the neighbourhoods with the best socio-economic conditions in the city of São Paulo. This may be because all the infected subjects had been abroad [46] . In the first two weeks, the best socio-economic conditions was presented as a risk factor. Then, there was a change in the spatial pattern from the fourth week onwards, when the worst socio-economic level became a risk factor.Similarly, Souza et al. [3] showed a higher risk of diagnosed COVID-19 cases in census tracts with higher per capita income in the São Paulo metropolitan region during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic. After these first cases in the richest areas, the virus started to circulate in the suburbs of the city, with high population density and worsened sanitary conditions [47] . This probably explains its fast transmission. The city of São Paulo is particularly vulnerable because it is the most populated city in the country, with approximately 12 million inhabitants [48] , and it is highly connected with other countries worldwide via its main airport, the São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport, which is the largest in Brazil, with non-stop passenger flights to 103 destinations across 30 countries [37] .In this study, we used SIM instead of the SIVEP Gripe database, unlike other studies [3] . The recommendation of the State Health Department [49] to register the notification of death and the monitoring of mortality using SIM, in practice, leads to a timelapse between the event and the use of information. COVID-19 mortality data were improved in the city of São Paulo with PRO-AIM, using the Laboratory EnvironmentManager System (GAL) and Flu Surveillance Information System (Sivep Gripe). These characteristics, combined with the possibility of assessing home or unattended deaths, motivated the option of using SIM data (which considered the confirmed and suspected diagnoses in analysing mortality due to . It is necessary to emphasise that the recommendation to register confirmed and suspected deaths due to COVID-19 [49] (that motivated the change of the codes assigned by the health services since the beginning of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the crisis, and which is applied by SMS-SP to monitor the evolution of events) has notbeen applied yet.Our study findings must be considered in the context of several assumptions and data limitations. We associated patients' addresses or postcodes to the area-based socioeconomic conditions using geolocalisation. This may provide some insight into the likelihood of exposure to health factors and COVID-19 risks. This approach is frequently used as representative of individual socio-economic conditions. Nevertheless, they are not a perfect picture of the individuals' conditions, and they could underestimate the magnitude of social disproportion related to individual social measures [50] . Rather, they are best employed along with individual-level variables to reflect geographical or aggregate-level risks [38] . We highlight that our spatial analysis is subject to methodological limitations caused by ecological fallacy and the modifiable areal unit problem. These constraints are intrinsic to any spatial analysis that uses aggregated data [51] . Despite these, our study still contributes to healthcare planning measures and to future precision studies focusing on the effects of social health factors on COVID-19deaths. In addition, one of the strengths of our study was that it dealt with COVID-19 deaths instead of the cases (owing to the better accuracy and coverage of the data). When we consider only the cases, many asymptomatic cases may not be reported and this could hamper the conclusions.We used models with spatial and spatiotemporal architectures to investigate the patterns of confirmed and total (confirmed and suspected) COVID-19 deaths in the city of São Paulo. The obtained results, after considering both categories, showed differences regarding the magnitude of the rates and RR. However, there were no differences with respect to the derived conclusions. The risk of mortality due to COVID-19 was the highest between the 20 th and 23 rd EW, followed by an apparent stabilisation of the temporal trend.However, we did not rule out a possible future rise in mortality. A high socio-economic level was shown to protect against the risk of mortality due to COVID- 19 Posterior means of the relative risks and 95% credible interval for the socioeconomic covariate obtained with spatial models for confirmed and total COVID-19 deaths, according to each one of the epidemiologic weeks.

301aec5312b8f5632930ead85c75ed88053fd2cc,COVID-19 prevalence in 161 countries and over time,"Accurate estimates of the true prevalence of COVID-19 in a population are needed for evaluating (and optimizing) disease control policies and testing strategies, determining seasonal effects, predicting future disease spread, assessing the risk of foreign travel and determining vaccination needs [1] . Further, parameter-rich and potentially underdetermined epidemiological models [2, 3] generally benefit from independently obtained estimates of disease prevalence. Due to the existence of a large fraction of asymptomatic cases, as well as variation in reporting, testing effort and testing strategies (e.g., random vs symptom-triggered), confirmed case counts cannot be directly converted to infection counts and a comparison of confirmed case counts between countries is generally of limited informative value [4] . While large-scale seroprevalence surveys (e.g., using antibody tests) can yield information on the disease's true prevalence in a population, such surveys involve substantial financial and logistical challenges and only yield prevalence estimates at a specific time point.In contrast to case reports, COVID-19-related death counts are generally regarded as less sensitive to testing effort and strategy [5, 6] , and fortunately most countries have established nationwide continuous reporting mechanisms for death counts. Hence, in principle, knowing the infection fatality risk (IFR, the probability of death following infection) should permit a conversion of death counts to infection counts [5, 6] . The IFR of COVID-19, however, depends strongly on the patient's age, and hence the effective IFR of the entire population depends on the population's age structure as well as the disease's age distribution [7] . Indeed, it was shown that the age-dependency of the IFR, the age-dependency of COVID-19 prevalence, and the age structure of the population are largely sufficient to explain variation in the effective IFR between countries [8] . This suggests that age-stratified death counts can (and must) be used with age-dependent IFR estimates in order to obtain an accurate estimate of infection counts. This approach has been successfully used to estimate COVID-19 prevalence over time in Europe until May 4, 2020 [6] .Unfortunately, the ongoing pandemic necessitates continuously updated prevalence estimates. Moreover, age-stratified and time-resolved death statistics are not readily available for many countries with insufficiently comprehensive reporting, thus preventing a direct adoption of the above approach [6, 9] . In cases where only total death counts are available (e.g., as disseminated by the World Health Organization) one needs to somehow independently determine the likely age distribution of infections in order to convert total death counts to infection counts. Here I address this challenge by leveraging information on the age distribution of COVID-19 infections from multiple countries with available age-stratified death reports, to estimate the likely age-distribution of COVID-19 in other countries, while accounting for each country's age structure. Based on these calibrations, I estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 (cumulative number of infections, weekly new infections and exponential growth rate) over time in 161 countries up until November 1, 2020, among adults aged 20 years or more. My predictions are largely consistent with data from multiple previously published nationwide seroprevalence surveys.In order to calculate infection counts solely from total (i.e., non-age-stratified) death counts, while accounting for the age-dependency of the IFR and each country's population age structure, independent estimates of the ratios of infection risks between age groups (i.e., the risk of infection in any one age group relative to any other age group) are needed. To determine the general distribution of age-specific infection risk ratios, I analyzed weekly age-stratified COVID-19-related death reports from 20 countries around the world using a probabilistic model of Poisson-distributed time-delayed death counts (see Methods for details). Briefly, for any given country c, any given week w, and any given age group g, I assumed that the number of new infections during that week (I c,w,g ) is approximately equal to α c,g I c,w,r N c,g /N c,r , where r represents some fixed reference age group, N c,g is the population size of age group g, and α c,g is the relative risk of an individual in age group g being infected compared to that of an individual in age group r. The expected number of deaths in each age group 4 weeks later (roughly the average time lag between infection and death [10] ), denoted D c,w+4,g , was assumed to be I c,w,g R g , where R g is the IFR for that age group. Age-specific IFRs were calculated beforehand by taking the average over multiple IFR estimates reported in the literature [8, 9, [11] [12] [13] [14] . This model thus accounts for the age-structure of each country, the age-distribution of the disease in each country and the age-dependency of the IFR. A critical assumption of the model is that, in any given country, nationwide age-specific infection risks co-vary linearly between age groups over time, i.e., an increase of disease prevalence in one age group coincides with a proportional increase of prevalence in any other age group. This assumption is motivated by the observation that nationwide death rates generally covary strongly linearly between age groups ( Fig. 1A and Supplemental Fig. S1 ); the adequacy of this model is also confirmed in retrospect (see below). For each country, I fitted the infection risk ratios α c,g (for all g = r) as well as the weekly infections in the reference age-group I c,w,r (one per week) to the age-stratified weekly death counts using a maximum-likelihood approach and assuming that weekly death counts follow a Poisson distribution. This stochastic model explained the data generally well, with observed weekly death counts almost always falling within the 95% confidence interval of the model's predictions (Supplemental Fig. S2 ). This supports the initial assumption that infection risks co-vary approximately linearly between age groups over time and suggests that country-specific but time-independent infection risk ratios are largely sufficient for describing the age-distribution of COVID-19 infections in a country and over time. For any given age group g, the fitted infection risk ratios α c,g differed between countries but were generally within the same order of magnitude (Fig. 1B) . On the basis of this observation, and as explained in the next section, it thus seems possible to approximately estimate the number of infections in any other country based on total death counts, the population's age structure and the ensemble of infection risk ratios α c,g fitted above.Based on the ensemble of fitted infection risk ratios and total (non-age-stratified) COVID-19-related death count reports disseminated by the WHO, I estimated the true weekly infection counts over time in each of 161 countries (details in Methods). Briefly, for any given country c, week w and any given set of relative infection risks α 1 , α 2 , .., the total number of deaths 4 weeks later was assumed to be Poisson-distributed with expectation equal to:consistent with the previously described model, where as before R g is the IFR for age group g, N c,g is the population size of age group g and I c,w,r is the (a priori unknown) number of new infections in the reference age group r during week w. For the sum in Eq. (1), I considered only age groups at 20 years or older (in 5-year intervals), because estimates of the infection risk ratios α g were unreliable for younger ages (due to low death counts) and because deaths among less-than-20-year olds were numerically negligible compared to the total number of deaths reported. For each week, the unknown I c,w,r was estimated via maximumlikelihood based on the total deaths reported 4 weeks later. The total number of new infections among ≥20-year olds during that week was estimated as I c,w = I c,w,r g α g N c,g /N c,r . Cumulative (i.e., past and current) infection counts were calculated as incremental sums of the weekly infection count estimates. The pandemic's exponential growth rate over time was subsequently calculated from the estimated weekly infection counts based on a Poisson distribution model and using a sliding-window approach.Depending on the particular choice of infection risk ratios, this yielded different estimates for the weekly nationwide infection counts, the cumulative infection counts and the exponential growth rates over time. Uncertainty in the true infection risk ratios in any particular country was accounted for by randomly sampling from the full distribution of fitted infection risk ratios multiple times, and calculating confidence intervals of the predictions based on the obtained distribution of estimates. Estimated weekly and cumulative infection fractions (i.e., relative to population size) and exponential growth rates over time are shown for a selection of countries in Fig. 2 and Supplemental Figs. S3 and S4. A comprehensive and periodically updated report of estimates for all 161 countries is being made available at www.loucalab.com/archive/COVID19prevalence. Global color-maps of the latest estimates for all countries are shown in Fig. 3 .To assess the accuracy of the above approach, I compared the estimated cumulative infection fractions to previously published nationwide antibody-based seroprevalence surveys across 12 countries (Supplemental Table S2 ). Only surveys attempting to estimate nationwide seroprevalence in the general population (in particular, either using geographically or demographically stratified sampling or adjusting for sample demographics) were included. Agreement between model estimates and seroprevalence estimates was generally good, with seroprevalence point-estimates for 8 out of 9 countries (all except Brazil) being included in the model's 95%-confidence intervals (Figs. 2K,L,N,O and Supplemental Fig. S3 ). Apart from potentially erroneous model predictions (discussed below), deviations from seroprevalence-based estimates may also be due to the fact that antibody concentrations in infected individuals (especially asymptomatic ones) can drop over time, rendering many of them seronegative [15] [16] [17] . Thus, previously infected individuals may not all be recognized as such. Further, sensitivity and specificity estimates for antibody tests performed in the laboratory or claimed by manufactures need not always apply in a community setting [17], thus introducing biases in seroprevalence estimates despite adjustments for sensitivity and specificity.Estimates of the true COVID-19 prevalence in a population can yield insight into the pandemic's growth dynamics that may not have been possible from reported case counts alone. Indeed, according to the present estimates, in most countries case counts initially severely underestimated the number of true infections and often did not properly reflect the progression of the pandemic, although in many countries more recent case reports do capture a much larger fraction of infections and more closely reflect the pandemic's dynamics (Figs. 2A-E and Supplemental Fig. S4 ). For example, in the US, France, Sweden, Belgium, Spain, United Kingdom and many other European countries reported cases only reflected a small fraction of infections occurring in Spring 2020, while the majority of infections occurring in Summer and Fall 2020 have been successfully detected. Nevertheless, in multiple countries even recent case counts do not correctly reflect the actual dynamics of the pandemic, sometimes even suggesting an opposite trend in its growth. For example, recent case counts in Turkey, Iran, Egypt and Afghanistan severely underestimate the disease's rapid ongoing growth (Supplemental Fig. S5 ). Future investigations, enabled by the infection rate estimates presented here, might be able to identify the main factors (e.g., political, financial, organizational) driving the discrepancies between infections and detected cases and suggest concrete steps to eliminate them or correct for them.As infection counts do not depend on testing effort and strategies, they are arguably more suitable for comparing the pandemic's progression between countries. Future investigations, enabled by the estimates presented here, might be able to identify concrete political, environmental and socioeconomic factors influencing the pandemic's growth. For example, my results indicate that as of November 1, 2020 Swedenoften criticized for it's reluctance to impose strong restrictions on it's citizens -was experiencing a slower increase of infections (relative to its population size) than many other European countries such as France, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom (Supplemental Fig. S4) . A similar observation can be made for the US, also frequently pointed out as a particularly severely affected country: As of November 1, 2020 the weekly fraction of newly infected individuals (relative to population size) appears to be substantially lower in the US than in many European countries ( Fig. 2F and Supplemental Fig. S4 ), while the cumulative fraction of infected individuals in the US is comparable to some European countries (e.g., Belgium, United Kingdom, Spain) and much lower than many South American countries (Supplemental Fig. S6 ). These observations highlight the importance of considering actual infection counts (and of course death counts) relative to population size when evaluating policy differences between countries.The predictions presented here are subject to some important caveats. First, incomplete, erroneous or agebiased reporting of COVID-19-related deaths will have a direct impact on the estimated infection counts. This caveat is particularly important for countries with less developed medical or reporting infrastructure, as well as for countries were reports may be censored or modified for political reasons. Comparisons of results between countries should thus be done with care. Second, the age-specific infection risk ratios (α c,g ) were calibrated based on available age-stratified death statistics from a limited number of countries, and may not apply to all other countries (for example due to strong cultural differences). Uncertainty associated with this extrapolation is partly accounted for by considering infection risk ratios calibrated to multiple alternative countries (see Methods). Third, age-specific IFRs were obtained from studies in only a few countries (mostly western) and often based on a small subset of closely monitored cases (e.g., from the Diamond Princess cruise ship). These IFR estimates may not be accurate for all countries, especially countries with a very different medical infrastructure, different sex ratios in the population or a different prevalence of pre-existing health conditions (e.g., diabetes), all of which can affect the IFR. That said, estimated trends over time within any given country, in particular exponential growth rates (e.g., Figs. 2P-T), are unlikely to be substantially affected by such biases. To nevertheless examine the robustness of my estimates against variations in the IFR, I repeated the above analyses by considering for each age group an ensemble of IFRs, i.e., randomly sampling from the set of previously reported IFRs [8, 9, [11] [12] [13] [14] rather than considering their mean. Median model predictions remained nearly unchanged, however unsurprisingly the uncertainty (i.e., confidence intervals) of the estimates increased (examples in Supplemental Fig. S7 ).I have presented estimates of the true nationwide prevalence and growth rate of COVID-19 infections over time in 161 countries around the world, based on official COVID-19-related death reports, age-specific infection fatality risks and each country's population age structure. My estimates are largely consistent with data from nationwide general-population seroprevalence surveys. My findings suggest that while in many countries the detection of infections has greatly improved, there are also examples where even recent reported case counts do not properly reflect the pandemic's dynamics. In particular, comparisons between countries based on infection counts can yield very different conclusions than comparisons merely based on confirmed case counts. My estimates thus enable more precise assessments of the disease's progression, evaluation and improvement of public interventions and testing strategies, and estimation of nationwide vaccination needs.Age-specific infection fatality risks (IFRs) were calculated based on the following literature: Table 1 in [12] , Supplementary Appendix Q in [8] , Table S2 in [13] , Table 2 in [11] , Table S4 in [9] , and Eq. (1) in [14] . For each considered age group, the average IFR across all of the aforementioned published IFRs was used, after linearly interpolating where necessary (Supplemental Table S1 ).Age-specific population sizes for each country (status 2019) were downloaded from the United Nations website (https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/CSV) on October 23, 2020 [18] . Time series of nationwide cumulative COVID-19-related death counts grouped by 5-year age intervals were downloaded on November 30, 2020 from COVerAGE-DB (https://osf.io/7tnfh), which is a database that gathers and curates official death count statistics from multiple official sources [19] . For each country included in COVerAGE-DB, and separately for each age-group, I ensured that cumulative death counts are non-decreasing over time by linearly re-interpolating death counts at problematic time points. The resulting time series were then linearly interpolated onto a regular weekly time grid, i.e., in which adjacent time points are 7 days apart (no extrapolation was performed, i.e., only dates covered by the original time series were included). The weekly number of new deaths in each age group were calculated as the difference of cumulative deaths between consecutive time points on the weekly grid. To ensure a high accuracy in the estimated infection risk ratios, in the following analysis I only considered countries for which COVerAGE-DB covered at least 10 weeks with at least 100 reported deaths each. The following 20 countries were thus considered: Argentina, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Germany, Ecuador, France, United Kingdom, Indonesia, India, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Peru, Philippines, Sweden, Turkey and United States.For each considered country c, I chose as ""reference"" age group r the age group that had the highest cumulative number of deaths. For each other age group g, I estimated the infection risk ratio α c,g , i.e., the probability of an individual in group g being infected relative to the probability of an individual in group r being infected, using a probabilistic model according to which the number of deaths in group g during week w (denoted D c,w,g ) was Poisson distributed with expectation:Here, N c,g is the population size of age group g in country c and R g is the IFR for age group g. Under this model, the maximum-likelihood estimate for α c,g , i.e. given the weekly death count time series, is given by:To avoid errors due to sampling noise, only weeks with at least 100 reported deaths were considered in the sums in Eq. (3) . I mention that α c,g might also alternatively be estimated as the slope of the linear regression:For purposes of evaluating the model's adequacy (explained below), I also estimated the weekly number of infections in the reference age group, I c,w,r , via maximum-likelihood based on a probabilistic model in which D c,w,g was Poisson-distributed with expectation:Under this model, the maximum-likelihood estimate for I c,w−4,r is given by:To evaluate the adequacy of the above stochastic model in explaining the original death count data, I simulated multiple hypothetical weekly death counts for each age group and compared the distribution of simulated death counts to the true death counts. Specifically, for each country c, week w and age group g, I drew 100 random death counts (D c,w,g ) from a Poisson distribution with expectation:Median simulated death counts and 50 % and 95% confidence intervals, along with the original death counts, are shown for a representative selection of countries and age groups in Supplemental Fig. S3 . As can be seen in that figure, the model's simulated time series are largely consistent with the original data.Time series of total (non-age-stratified) nationwide cumulative reported death and case counts were downloaded from the website of the World Health Organization (https://covid19.who.int/table) on November 30, 2020. Cumulative death and case counts were made non-decreasing and interpolated onto a weekly time grid as described above. Only countries that reported at least one death per week for at least 10 weeks were included in the analysis below. For each country c, week w and any particular choice of age-specific infection risk ratios α 1 , α 2 , .., the number of infections was estimated as follows. Let r denote some fixed reference age group with respect to which infection risk ratios are defined, i.e., such that α r = 1 (here, ages 70-74 were used as reference). Let I c,w,r be the (a priori unknown) number of new infections occurring during that week in the reference age group. The number of deaths occurring 4 weeks later in any age group g, D c,w+4,g , was assumed to be Poisson-distributed with expectation equal to:The total number of weekly deaths, D c,w+4 , is thus Poisson-distributed with expectation:The total number of weekly infections, I c,w , can thus be estimated as:The cumulative number of total infections up until any given week can be estimated by summing the weekly infection counts.Exponential growth rates over time were estimated from the weekly infection counts using a slidingwindow approach, as follows. In every sliding window (spanning 4 consecutive weeks), an exponential function of the form I(t) = Ae tλ was fitted, where t denotes time in days and A and λ are unknown parameters (in particular, λ is the exponential growth rate in that window). The parameters A and λ were fitted via maximum likelihood, assuming that the total number of weekly infections, I c,w , was Poisson distributed with expectation Ae twλ . Under this model, the log-likelihood of the data (more precisely, of the previously estimated weekly infection counts) is:where w iterates over all weeks in the specific sliding window. The maximum-likelihood estimates of A and λ are obtained by solving ∂ ln L/∂λ = 0 and ∂ ln L/∂A = 0, which quickly leads to the condition:Equation (13) was solved numerically to obtain the maximum-likelihood estimateλ.To assess estimation uncertainties stemming from sampling stochasticity and uncertainties in the infection risk ratios, I repeated the above estimations 100 times using alternative infection risk ratios (for each age group drawn randomly from the set of infection risk ratios previously fitted to various countries) and replacing in Eq. (10) the death counts D c,w+4 with values drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean D c,w+4 . Hence, rather than point-estimates, all predictions are reported in the form of medians and confidence intervals. Only infection risk ratios for which the corresponding linear curve (Eq. 4) achieved a coefficient of determination (R 2 ) greater than 0.5 were used (shown in Fig. 1) , to avoid less accurately estimated infection risk ratios (typically obtained from countries with low death rates).

b8bc52b13aea33c72d9990b5a1b1dcd6b7a7dd14,Clinical characteristics of critically ill patients with COVID-19,"In December 2019, a new coronavirus was identified by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. On March 11th of 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak as a pandemic due to the constantly increasing number of cases outside China 1 . Up to date, SARS-CoV-2 affected more than 32 million people over the world and caused 1 million deaths.On March 3rd of 2020, 64 days after the first case was reported in China, a case in Argentina was confirmed. Since then the number of cases gently ascended 2 ; up to September 30th of 2020, a total of 736.609 had tested positive for the new SARS-CoV-2, with 139.419 active cases and 3.792 (2.7%) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) 3 .Nevertheless, local information about the incidence and clinical characteristics of critically ill patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is still limited 4 . In this context, knowledge of the baseline characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients is crucial for health and government officials engaged in planning efforts to address local outbreaks. This case series describes clinical characteristics, image findings and respiratory mechanics of COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU in a High Complexity Hospital in the city of Buenos Aires.For this retrospective single-center study, ICU patients were recruited between March 15th of 2020 and September 15th of 2020. Data were obtained from medical records of adult patients (18 years of age or older) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, hospitalized in the ICU in a High Complexity Hospital in the city of Buenos Aires. Patients with adequacy of therapeutic effort at ICU admission were excluded.According to WHO guidance 5 , laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 was defined as a positive result of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal swabs. Only laboratory-confirmed cases were included in the analysis and the study was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee in March 2019.Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, respiratory support, and outcome data were obtained. Radiologic assessment of chest x-rays and all laboratory testing was performed according to treating physician criteria. The presence of a radiologic abnormality was determined and the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) score 6 was calculated and reviewed by medical imaging specialists. Laboratory assessment consisted of a complete blood count, a blood chemical analysis, coagulation testing, assessment of liver and renal function, and measure of electrolytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, pro b-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP), lactate dehydrogenase, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTnT), d-dimer, ferritin and interleukin-6 (IL-6).The number of patients who had died or had been discharged, and those that stayed in the ICU until September 30th of 2020 was recorded. Additionally, ICU length of stay was determined.No statistical sample size calculation was performed in advance and the sample size was equal to the number of patients treated during the study period. Continuous variables were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges or simple ranges, as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages.No imputation was made for missing data. Mann-Whitney rank-sum test was used to compare nonparametric continuous variables. χ2 or Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables as appropriate. All statistical tests were 2-tailed, and statistical significance was defined as P < .05. The analysis has not been adjusted for multiple comparisons, and given the possibility of a type I error, the findings should be interpreted as exploratory and descriptive. All the analyses were performed with the use of R Software, version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).Between March 15th of 2020 and September 15th of 2020, a total of 259 patients with suspected COVID-19 were referred to the ICU in a high complexity hospital in the city of Buenos Aires. A total of 87 patients with negative test results for SARS-CoV-2 were not included in the study. Additionally, 4 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 but adequacy of therapeutic effort at ICU admission were excluded too. Thus, data from 168 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was analyzed.Overall, 66% (111) patients were male with a median age of 67(58-75) years old. Eighty percent (134) of patients presented at least one comorbidity. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity, affecting 52,4% (88) of patients, followed by obesity in 41,6% (70) patients. 6.5% (11) of patients admitted were health-care workers. Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients.The median (IQR) time between symptoms onset and hospital admission was 4 days (2-7). Fever was referred by 91,1% (153) of patients followed by shortness of breath (52.4% [88] patients). The main ICU admission criteria were clinical monitoring (59.5% of patients [100]), and 40.5% (68) of patients needed MV at ICU arrival. The median time up to ICU admission was 7 days (4-9) since symptoms onset.The time elapse of MV was 16 days (19-30) among overall ventilated patients and 8 days (6-14) among those who were successfully extubated (26 [22.8%] ). 32 patients (28.1%) underwent percutaneous tracheostomy due to prolonged weaning. The median time of MV until tracheostomy was 20 days (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) . 10 patients (8.7%) remained under MV at data cut off. Table 3 shows respiratory mechanics, oxygenation parameters and adjunctive therapies applied.Most of the patients received dexamethasone (on RECOVERY-trial dose 9 Among overall patients, the median duration of hospitalization was 21 days (14-32) and the median length of stay in ICU was 13 days (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) . ICU length of stay among survivors was 5 days (3-8) for non-ventilated patients and 23 days (16-31) for those patients who required invasive MV. Overall ICU mortality of this series was 25% (42). Table 4 shows treatments, ICU related complications, and clinical outcomes at data cutoff.The population in this study consisted mostly of men (66%) with a median age of 67 (58-75) years old, which is substantially high compared to the median age of all the positive Argentinian cases of COVID-19 (38 years old) 10 . The previous suggests that gender and age are risk factors for admission to the ICU, as previously reported 11 . Moreover, in this cohort, most of the patients (79.7%) had at least one comorbidity, with a large proportion of patients with hypertension (52.4%) and obesity (41,6%).Since patients required MV for a long period of time, due to prolonged weaning, there were more that underwent percutaneous tracheostomy compared to those who were successfully extubated (32 patients [28.1%] and 26 patients [22. 8%], respectively). At the beginning of the pandemic, several scientific societies warned about a possible increase in the request for tracheostomies related to SARS-CoV-2 infection 25 , 26 , 27 ,29 . The need for tracheostomies in critically ill COVID-19 patients ranges from 36% to 53%, according to the data found in the literature [28] [29] [30] .Prioritizing the protection of health personnel, tracheostomy was considered possible only in patients who were expected to obtain a substantial benefit. Ideally, it was performed 21 days after intubation with a negative RT-PCR test 31 . Following that criteria and up to data cutoff, none of the surgeons or intensivists who performed tracheostomies developed symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19. Nevertheless, a longer time of MV prior to tracheostomy was observed in relation to a previous series from the same center in a non-pandemic scenario (median 20 days [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] and 9 days [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , respectively) 32 .ICU mortality rate was slightly lower than a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that informed a 41.6% (34.0-49.7) ICU mortality rate across international studies. This could be explained because, optimistically, countries in the later phase of the pandemic may be coping better with COVID-19 33 .Although this study is considered limited due to the relatively small number of patients from a single center and could not be broadly applicable to other patients with critical illness, it definitely provides initial experience regarding characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with critical illness in South America.",Argentina,abstract,2020-12-11,12
ade994770bf4707108acb604f3ca1be57daf48a8,O R I G I N A L R E S E A R C H Neurology Stroke in patients infected by the novel coronavirus and its causal mechanisms: A narrative review,"complications of the infection by the novel coronavirus occurred as a result of ischemic, hemorrhagic, and/or thromboembolic etiologies.The occurrence of stroke during the pandemic as a result of the novel coronavirus has a multifactorial character, and emergency physicians should focus on systematic measures for its screening and accurate diagnosis as well as on appropriate interventions based on early decisionmaking that may have a favorable impact on reducing damage and saving lives. Regarding the neurological symptoms in patients with COVID-19, they usually manifest mildly and include headache, dizziness, and neuralgia.Other cases can be more severe, with neurological complications such as stroke. 5 Stroke has an ischemic etiology in 80% of cases, while the minority has a hemorrhagic cause. 6 Stroke is a medical emergency with an increasing incidence, and it is the second leading cause of death worldwide. 7 whereas the rate in the general population without COVID-19 is 0.5%.In addition to respiratory symptoms, the perception of neurological symptoms also should be considered as an indicator for the diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. 5 In most cases, stroke first occurs in the emergency sectors, in which the early identification of suspected cases is a priority as well as the appropriate decisionmaking, with significant impacts on the morbidity and mortality of these patients. 10 Given the possibility of the association between COVID-19 and stroke, two lethal clinical conditions, it is important for health profes-sionals, particularly those working in acute care settings, to understand and focus on the clinical picture and pathophysiology of these diseases to save as many lives as possible. Therefore, the objective of the present review was to summarize the literature to date on ischemic stroke and COVID-19, evaluating the mechanisms of stroke development during COVID-19.We conducted a narrative review of studies on the novel coronavirus that contained information on associated stroke. The objectives were based on the population, intervention, comparisons, and outcomes strategy and choice of descriptors. 11 For the proposed review, 142 articles were identified: 89 articles in tomography images, and significantly higher mortality. These data were reinforced in recent studies in which the elderly and patients with cardiovascular disease showed a higher prevalence of acute stroke as a complication of COVID-19. [23] [24] [25] [26] In addition to these lines of evidence, the disease severity was also associated with hypercoagulability, as indicated by the high concentration of D-dimers. 27 Giannis et al 28 showed that the stroke mechanism in these patients with different profiles does not appear to be similar. Figure 1 shows the probable pathophysiological mechanisms involving COVID-19 and the occurrence of neurological symptoms and stroke.As a limitation of the study, no detailed description was provided for other neurological conditions that did not coincide with stroke as well as for post-COVID-19 neurological manifestations. Although we recognize their importance, it was not the priority objective of this review.The This finding could explain peripheral neuronal manifestations, such as the loss of smell and taste, present in those infected by the novel coronavirus. 5 The virus could also explore a pathway mediated by both macrophages and the lymphatic pathways to reach the brain as well as other organs. 5 Another possible related mechanism is the persis- thy that could lead to venous and arterial thromboembolic events. 23, 32 In cases of hemorrhagic events, the suggested cause was the theory of the involvement of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 expressed in the capillary endothelium. This interaction could result in arterial hypertension and, consequently, an increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage. 1, 13, 15, 17, 18 The coagulation cascade could also be present due to the prothrombotic responses caused by the virus, resulting in the formation of blood clots. 31 Thus, in the infected population, there is unification of the inflammatory pathways and coagulation in the genesis of thromboembolic complications, possibly by activation of factors that compound the Virchow triad, including vascular damage, altered blood flow, and blood hypercoagulability. 33 Thus, 2 key points were highlighted for the assessment and decision making by professionals in the acute care settings regarding those infected with the novel coronavirus who also show stroke manifestations. The first is the attention to the manifestations of stroke in patients with risk factors or preexisting diseases in which stroke could occur as a result of a decompensation of underlying diseases. The second is regarding previously healthy patients in whom the direct action of the virus would contribute both to the cytokine storm and a greater occurrence of thromboembolic events. 5, 21 The strengths of the present review include highlighting the strong emerging evidence for the importance of tracking neurological symptoms, as already performed for respiratory symptoms, in patients infected with the novel coronavirus. In the emergency department,where these patients usually have their first attendance, this screening should be performed early and systematically because once the diagnosis of neurological symptoms is confirmed in co-occurrence or as a complication of the viral disease, it will course with greater severity, with a higher prevalence of hospitalization in intensive care and higher mortality.In this review, we confirmed that stroke is part of the spectrum of clinical manifestations resulting from COVID-19 and is associated with a worse prognosis. Cerebrovascular lesions resulting from complications of the infection by the novel coronavirus occurred as a result of ischemic, hemorrhagic, and/or thromboembolic etiologies. Thus, the occurrence of stroke during the pandemic due to the novel coronavirus has a multifactorial character, and emergency physicians should focus on systematic measures for its screening and accurate diagnosis as well as the appropriate interventions based on early decisionmaking, which may have a favorable impact on reducing damage and saving lives.All authors declare that they have no financial relationships with any organization that may have an interest in the work submitted in the previous 3 years and no other relationship or activity that may appear to have influenced the work submitted.All data used to prepare this article are available from the sources cited.",Brazil,first author,2020-12-26,12
c6a261f65701254186db88398cfeee293cdd99dd,Epidemiology and Infection COVID-19 mortality in an area of northeast Brazil: epidemiological characteristics and prospective spatiotemporal modelling,"The coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first emerged in Wuhan city, China, and quickly became a threat to public health worldwide. The infection shows a high potential for spreading and has reached several countries, resulting in being declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 [1] .The pandemic process has caused economic and social consequences in many regions around the world. Additionally, due to the quick dissemination of the virus, as well as the failures in the implementation of strategies to face it in some areas, the number of individuals infected and dead by the disease is increasing and this situation represents a challenge to health systems [1, 2] .According to the WHO, COVID-19 has affected more than 215 countries with approximately 50 million confirmed cases and 1 200 000 deaths worldwide by 10 November 2020, which corresponds to a mean case-fatality rate of approximately 2.5% [1] . In November 2020, the United States was the country most affected by COVID-19, with more than 10 million cases and 238 000 deaths. In Europe, one of the most affected continents, United Kingdom, Italy, France and Spain were the countries that registered the most deaths in the region [3] . By 23 July 2020, Brazil was the second country in the worldwide ranking of number of cases and deaths, and hence, considered the disease epicentre in Latin America [1] , accounting for more than 2 million cases and 80 000 deaths. COVID-19 in the Northeast region of Brazil represents a serious public health problem and its impact may be greater, considering the interiorisation process and its growing expansion to more vulnerable areas [4] . In this region, there were high rates of incidence (1150) and mortality (41.4) per 100 000 inhabitants, which corresponds to the second most affected region in the country. The state of Sergipe has followed the exponential increase of rates, with a higher incidence and mortality than the regional (2288 cases and 57.2 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants, respectively) [5] .COVID-19 has a heterogeneous geographic dynamic in different regions. Although SARS-CoV-2 has a high potential for contamination and reaches all communities, some areas may be more affected than others, as many regions do not have adequate health resources and infrastructure to face the pandemic effectively [6] .In addition, the elderly and individuals with chronic diseases are at a higher risk for developing more severe forms and dying due to COVID-19 [7] . Consequently, specific characteristics of the population and the balance between supply and demand in the assistance of severe cases can lead to variations in local mortality rates [8, 9] .Since the first cases of COVID-19 in Brazil, spatial analysis techniques using geographic information systems (GIS) have been used to map the spread and severity of the pandemic [10, 11] . The use of this epidemiological tool enables the identification of the spatial dynamics of the disease, assisting in the planning, management and evaluation of public health policies [10] .Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the spatiotemporal distribution of deaths by COVID-19 in the state of Sergipe, Northeast, Brazil.We carried out an ecological study using spatial analysis and temporal trend techniques. All COVID-19 deaths registered in Sergipe, as reported by the Sergipe State Department of Health (SES/SE), from 2 April to 14 June 2020 were included. The analysis units were the 75 municipalities of Sergipe and data were collected daily, considering the places of residence of the individuals deceased due to COVID-19.Sergipe is located on the coast of the Northeast region of Brazil and has 75 municipalities divided into mesoregions (Leste -East, Agreste and Sertão -Hinterland). The metropolitan area includes Aracaju, its capital, Barra dos Coqueiros, Nossa Senhora do Socorro and São Cristóvão. Sergipe has a population of approximately 2 298 696 inhabitants, encompasses an area of 21 910 424 km 2 and a demographic density of 94.3 inhabitants/km 2 [12] .The variables analysed in the study were:(a) COVID-19 deaths registered in the 75 municipalities of Sergipe; (b) daily mortality rates in the state of Sergipe (per 100 000 inhabitants; considering the number of daily deaths by COVID-19 in the state as the numerator and the corresponding population as the denominator); (c) weekly mortality rates (per 100 000 inhabitants; considering the number of weekly deaths by COVID-19 in Sergipe and the municipalities that compose the metropolitan and countryside regions as the numerator and their corresponding populations as the denominator) and(d) accumulated mortality rate (per 100 000 inhabitants; considering the number of accumulated deaths by COVID-19 in the state and in each municipality as the numerator and the corresponding population as the denominator).The epidemiological variables used in the descriptive analysis were: age, sex, age group, race/colour, comorbidities, educational level, death site, time between symptom onset and test result, time between symptom onset and death and time between hospitalisation and death. Categorical variables were calculated by absolute and relative frequencies and continuous variables were calculated by median and interquartile range (IQR).The temporal trend analysis was performed using the segmented log-linear regression model. Weekly mortality rates of COVID-19 were considered dependent variables and epidemiological weeks were considered independent variables. The Monte Carlo permutation test was used to select the best model for inflection points, applying 999 permutations and considering the highest residue determination coefficient (R 2 ) [13, 14] . The calculation to describe and quantify the trends was developed by percentage increments (APCs, annual percentage changes) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). If more than one significant inflection was found during the study period, average annual percentage changes (AAPCs) were calculated. The trends were considered statistically significant when the APCs exhibited P < 0.05 and corresponding 95% CI did not include zero. Positive and significant values of APC indicate an increasing trend; negative and significant as a decreasing trend, and non-significant trends as stable, regardless of APC values [13, 14] .The addresses of the individuals deceased due to COVID-19 in Sergipe were georeferenced through the capture of latitude and longitude coordinates provided by Google Maps [15] and subsequent application of the non-parametric Kernel intensity test [16] . A density surface was generated for the visual detection of hot spots through statistical smoothing, indicating spatial cluster and continuous surface from georeferenced data [16] .Crude mortality rates were used in data analysis, as well as the local empirical Bayesian estimator. The Bayesian approach was used to minimise the instability caused by the random fluctuation of the cases. The model was applied to smooth the rates through weighted averages and create a new corrected coefficient [16] . The crude and smoothed rates were shown on thematic maps stratified into five categories of equal intervals: (a) 0 (without case records or information), (b) 0.1-10, (c) 10-20, (d) 20-30 and (e) ⩾30.The prospective space-time scanning statistic was performed to identify high-risk space-time clusters for COVID-19 mortality, using the discrete Poisson probability distribution model [17, 18] . The analysis identified potential active clusters during the study period. We consider still occurring space-time clusters that are present as active. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the expected number of deaths by COVID-19 in Sergipe is proportional to the size of its population and reflects a constant risk. The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the observed number of deaths exceeds the expected [17] [18] [19] .We established the following conditions for the model: minimum aggregation time of 2 days; minimum of five deaths; without overlapping clusters; circular clusters; maximum size of the spatial cluster of 10% of the at-risk population and maximum size of the temporal cluster of 50% of the study period. The primary and secondary clusters were detected using the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) test and represented through mapping. We calculated the relative risks (RRs) of mortality by COVID-19, taking into account each municipality and clusters in relation to its neighbours. The results that showed P < 0.05 using 999 Monte Carlo simulations were considered significant [17] [18] [19] .Microsoft Office Excel 2017 (Microsoft, Washington, USA) was used for data tabulation and descriptive analysis. Joinpoint Regression Program v. 4.5.0 (National Cancer Institute, Maryland, USA) [13, 14] was used to analyse the temporal trend. QGis 3.4.11 (QGIS Development Team, Open Source Geospatial Foundation Project, Oregon, USA) assisted in the creation of choropleth maps. TerraView 4.2.2 (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais, INPE, São José dos Campos, SP, Brazil) was used to carry out spatial analysis [20] and SaTScan™ 9.6 (Harvard Medical School, Boston and Information Management Service Inc., Maryland, USA) for the execution of space-time scanning [21] .The study was approved by the Human Research and Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Sergipe (CEP/UFS) with acceptance number 4086909, following national ethical recommendations and the Declaration of Helsinki.We observed the occurrence of 391 deaths due to COVID-19 in Sergipe, with an average of 130.3 deaths monthly. The median age was 65 years (IQR 53-77). The median time between the onset of symptoms and the result of diagnostic testing was 7 days (IQR 4-11) and between the onset of symptoms and death was 10 days (IQR 5-16). In cases that required hospital care, the median time between admission and death was 5 days (IQR 1-11). The highest percentage of deaths occurred among individuals aged ⩾60 years (62%), males (53%), non-white races/colours (58%) and those with low or no educational level (52%). The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (40%), diabetes mellitus (DM) (31%) and cardiovascular disease (15%). The most prevalent location of death was a hospital (87%) ( Table 1) . Figure 1 displays the number of deaths, and daily and accumulated mortality rates at the state level. The first death records occurred on 2 April 2020 and since then, there was an increase in the number of daily deaths, with the highest record on 7 June 2020 (n = 23). Therefore, there was an increase in the accumulated mortality rate, ranging from 0.09 (on 2 April 2020) to 16 .91 (on 14 June 2020) per 100 000 inhabitants. Table 2 displays the temporal trend of weekly mortality rates in Sergipe, its metropolitan area and countryside. The mortality rate in Sergipe showed an increasing trend (AAPC = 3.8, 95% CI 0.3-6.8, P < 0.01). In addition, increasing trends were observed when the analysis was performed by subgroup (metropolitan area and countryside), with a higher increase recognised to occur in countryside (APC = 3.8, 95% CI 3.0-4.5, P < 0.01) in comparison with the metropolitan area (AAPC = 2.9, 95% CI 0.2-5.5, P < 0.01).The Kernel analysis identified a density high cluster (hot spot) of deaths located in the East mesoregion of Sergipe, represented by municipalities from the metropolitan area and neighbouring cities. Intermediate risk agglomerations were observed in the north and south regions of the state (Fig. 2A) .The distribution of crude and smoothed mortality rates by COVID-19 is shown in Figure 2B and C, respectively. When analysing crude rates, there was a dispersion of municipalities with high mortality located in the Northeast, West and South, besides a group formed by municipalities with high mortality rates located in the East mesoregion of the state. Considering the smoothed rates, a process of expansion of the mortality high cluster was found, compared to the crude rates. The cluster included the metropolitan area and neighbouring municipalities, as demonstrated in the Kernel analysis. Figure 2D shows the emergent spatiotemporal cluster between 17 May and 14 June 2020, and comprises the municipalities of Itaporanga d'Ajuda, São Cristóvão, Salgado, Estância, Aracaju, Nossa Senhora do Socorro, Areia Branca, Boquim, Laranjeiras and Arauá. The RR of these municipalities was 5.66 (P < 0.001) ( Table 3 ), indicating that more deaths were observed than expected.Despite international, national and local efforts to face the pandemic, COVID-19 continues to cause socioeconomic damage and imply thousands of lives lost across the planet [1] . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide information about COVID-19 mortality in Sergipe applying temporal trend, spatial and spatiotemporal scan analysis techniques. Our findings can be useful for planning and developing strategies that aim to reduce deaths by COVID-19.Our results suggest that Sergipe is challenging an important public health crisis. Thus, the state is configured as a potential risk area for mortality by SARS-CoV-2, since it exceeds the number of deaths at regional and national levels [5] . We observed an increase in the number of daily deaths and accumulated mortality rates from the first days of May 2020, which continued until the end of the analysed period.The increase in the mortality rate persisted, even after the implementation of containment and mitigation strategies of the government initiated on 16 March 2020, such as school and university closures, suspension of events, concerts, sports activities and economic activity restrictions [22] . Failures in the mitigation process, mainly related to the inefficiency of social distancing strategies, could explain the maintenance of transmission and, therefore, the growth in the absolute number of deaths and mortality rates in the state [1, 2] .The association between increased cases and failures in disease mitigation strategies is reinforced by an investigation that identified an inverse relationship between social isolation rates and new cases of COVID-19 in Sergipe. A progressive decrease in social isolation was observed on 30 March 2020, and an increase in the daily average of accumulated cases noted in May 2020. In addition, the isolation rate on 13 May 2020 (42.2%) was lower than ideal (52.3%) to slow down the progression of the disease in the state [23] .Our findings indicate an increasing trend in weekly mortality rates due to COVID-19 across the state. The largest increase was observed in the countryside, compared to the metropolitan area. This is a serious concern for public administrators, as most municipalities in the countryside do not have sufficient infrastructure or intensive care unit (ICU) availability, which are essential. In addition, the high demand for reference hospitals in the metropolitan area can lead to overcrowding and consequent collapse of health services [24] [25] [26] .Deaths were more frequent among the elderly, according to corroborating studies conducted in China and Spain that also identified a greater prevalence of deaths in this age group and comparable median ages (65.8 and 67 years old, respectively) [27, 28] . Old age is constantly reported as a risk factor for fatal outcomes of COVID-19 [29, 30] . This suggests that senescence of the immune system may facilitate a faster progression of viral infection in these individuals [31] . Although the majority of deaths occurred in the elderly, we highlight that more than one-third of the deaths were among people under 60 years old. In this sense, risk reduction measures should not only be employed in vulnerable age groups [1] . We identified a higher proportion of deaths among males, consistent with findings of previous investigations that also showed this pattern of mortality [27, 32] . The predominance of severe outcomes of COVID-19 among men can be explained, generally due to this population's predisposition to adopt unhealthy lifestyles and have a higher prevalence of comorbidities [33] . Besides that, women are possibly less susceptible to viral infections due to the protective effects of the X chromosome and sex hormones, which have essential roles in the immune response [33, 34] .DM, hypertension and cardiovascular disease were the most frequent comorbidities. Previous studies [27, 32] identified a higher occurrence of fatal outcomes in people with these underlying diseases. The vulnerability of these patients may be related to changes in the immune response due to the pathophysiology of chronic diseases, resulting in increased susceptibility to complications [35] .A low educational level was reported in most of the deaths. This situation can make it difficult to understand health-related information in the context of a pandemic or to have basic good hygiene habits, implying that the impact caused by SARS-CoV-2 may be influenced by social determinants and vulnerable populations may be affected more. Although the pandemic process initiated among the upper social classes, COVID-19 has disproportionately affected the poorest [6] . A study conducted in New York identified higher rates of hospitalisation and death in a neighbourhood with a higher proportion of individuals with lower levels of education living in poverty [9] .The most deaths were registered to have occurred in hospitals, since the most severe cases required intensive hospital care for oxygenation and ventilation therapies, which are essential for treatment [36] . The median time between the onset of symptoms and death was 10 days. The infectious process and the development of severe disease appear, on average, 7 days after of symptom onset, and the time between of symptom onset and death varies from 2 to 8 weeks [37] . Regarding the time between hospital admission and death, our results are similar to those of another study, in which the median time was also found to be 5 days [32] .The COVID-19 pandemic is dynamic with heterogeneous geographic distribution. The first cases were registered in capital cities and metropolitan regions and quickly disseminated towards the countryside due to community transmission [11] . Moreover, economic networks, social mobility and travel flow are important factors to better understand the territorial progression of SARS-CoV-2 in different areas [38] [39] [40] .The spatial analysis techniques employed in this study allowed the identification of a mortality cluster by COVID-19 that comprises the metropolitan region and neighbouring cities. A local study [10] highlighted active clusters of the COVID-19 incidence in that same area of the state. The cluster of deaths in this region can be explained by the proximity of other municipalities to the metropolitan area. This region served as a source of spread of the virus to other neighbouring municipalities due to the intense urban mobility and economic activities between them. This may explain the higher incidence of the disease and, consequently, the high mortality in this area [10] .We identified, through prospective spatiotemporal analysis, an emerging cluster that includes municipalities of metropolitan area and cities that are parts of other regions of the state, such as the Agreste and Sul regions. Community transmission and virus dispersion in the countryside accrued increases in the number of deaths, since they lack the ideal structure for managing serious cases [11] . As a result, the high risk of mortality by COVID-19 in the countryside of Sergipe was expansive.The study has limitations related to the use of secondary data, which may include problems inherent in underreporting deaths and the quality of information. However, the findings may provide subsidies for SARS-CoV-2, since the identification of highrisk areas allows better management of resources, such as structuring the flows of the health care network, training of care teams and availability of mechanical ventilators and intensive care beds. We also emphasise the need for further investigations to better understand the spatiotemporal dynamics, identify clinical and social determinants related to higher mortality due to COVID-19, and plan the safe reopening of economic activities in Sergipe.The study showed that COVID-19 mortality is a serious public health problem in Sergipe that has victimised the elderly, men and individuals with chronic diseases, such as hypertension, DM and cardiovascular disease. Sergipe showed an increasing trend of COVID-19 mortality throughout its territory, with accelerated growth in the countryside. Spatial analysis and space-time scanning revealed that the distribution of deaths is heterogeneous, with the presence of an active high-risk cluster for mortality in the metropolitan area and neighbouring cities. We highlight the need for greater targeting of disease prevention and control strategies in the main risk areas, aiming to reduce the growth curve of mortality from the disease in the state.Financial support.

b9d5281a6a2cad3716391dffd4f0d21d1b0d92fe,Original research Multimorbidity patterns among COVID-19 deaths: proposal for the construction of etiological models,"Currently, the practice of medicine is complex, and it is even more so when faced with a new infection such as COVID-19. 1 Scientific knowledge provides guidelines for having an effective medicine, but when people have chronic diseases, more than one disease (co-occurrence), and receive several medicines, clinical practice becomes an even bigger challenge, especially when these chronic diseases do not receive adequate care. 2 In addition, conditions such as physical disability, mostly also as a consequence of these chronic diseases, could also increase vulnerability to complications from other different diseases.Evidence shows that multimorbidity is one of the clinical characteristics that most complicates the care of infected people, 3 which is clearly true for COVID-19 as well. Valderas et al. 4 defined multimorbidity as the ""presence of multiple diseases in one individual"", where comorbidity is just one of the possible forms of multimorbidity. For these authors comorbidity is the ""presence of additional diseases in relation to an index disease in one individual""; therefore, the co-occurrence of various pre-existing diseases with COVID-19 infection is not necessarily comorbidity. Multimorbidity among individuals with COVID-19 was described early among the first reported patients in the specialized literature, 5 and it is a frequent finding in published studies. 6, 7 However, the term comorbidity continues to be used incorrectly in most published studies. A critical reading of previous studies allows us to identify that, for the most of these.The objective of this study was to explore the effect of single diseases on the clinical severity or the risk of fatality among patients with diagnosis of COVID-19. This leaves out more complex approaches such as those that configure vulnerability of older adults as a construct beyond the effect of single diseases or their simple sum. Therefore, it is necessary to study multimorbidity as a multidimensional condition, which incorporates the joint presence and the interactions of all the health conditions. A deeper analysis should emphasize the type of potential relationships between health conditions, whether they are under medical control or not, as well as other sources of vulnerability such as disability, functional dependence on other people, the presence of geriatric syndromes or even the social and economic vulnerabilities, among others. Understanding the multimorbidity associated with emerging diseases such as COVID-19 is important to classify patients, identify possible etiological models, and define differential medical management guidelines. 8 In critical situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, a good classification of infected people is important to improve their care. For those who can seek hospital care, this can be done in the initial triage, and for those who are cared for at home, it will serve to identify the risk of infection severity. In addition, recognizing the multimorbidity as a multidimensional and complex condition will allow the development of more complex risk classifications, to identify subjects who need greater vigilance at the community and hospital level, or to formulate ""telework"" recommendations in certain occupations.The wide variety of multimorbidity patterns includes the most frequent co-occurrences that were evident since the beginning of the pandemic, and the co-occurrences with less frequency that appear every time there are more cases, and perhaps it will include orphan diseases, 9, 10 and those of endemic foci. 11 In these circumstances, low prevalence signifies more clinical complexity. In this study, we used Colombian data to describe patterns or multimorbidity among individuals diagnosed with COVID-19.Official nominal data of confirmed cases of COVID-19 for Colombia, with a cutoff date of June 11, 2020 throughout the country were included in this study. This data had a good performance according to an analysis based on Bedford's law. 12 Data used in this study correspond to the official report that is constructed daily with the cases that have been confirmed by the National Institute of Health, based on laboratory tests (reflex nasal swab reverse transcription PCR). Although it has a lag of a few days, it is the most reliable source of data on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Colombia. The other available sources have greater lags and may incorporate suspected cases that did not have confirmatory laboratory tests.By that date, 17 790 cases and 1 488 deaths by COVID-19 were reported. This database has information on each case, specifically: municipality and department of occurrence, date of onset of symptoms, date of diagnosis, date of report, sex, and age. For each dead individual, the presence or absence of a predetermined list of comorbidities is reported in the database: high blood pressure (HBP), diabetes mellitus, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), cerebrovascular disease, smoking, cancer, thyroid disease, autoimmune disease, and HIV. This list includes nine of the top 10 chronic diseases identified in a systematic review of measurements of multimorbidity. 13 Although smoking is not a chronic disease, it is a chronic health condition that has direct functional effects, beyond being a risk factor for other diseases, reason why it is incorporated as part of a broad definition of multimorbidity in this analysis.Individuals reported as hospitalized or in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were not included because they were in an intermediate stage of their medical treatment and the definitive outcome was unknown (recovery or death). Information about chronic disease among mild and moderate cases of COVID-19 is not available by the time of this analysis. The database can be requested from the Colombian Ministry of Health and Health Protection.Statistical methods. First, the description of the prevalence of each disease among fatal cases was made individually, without considering the co-occurrence of other health conditions. These patterns were compared between age groups using x 2 test. Subsequently, all possible disease dyads and triads were identified, characterizing multimorbidity. With this procedure the 10 most prevalent (>2%) multimorbidity patterns were recognized. For the estimation of prevalences, it was assumed that the individuals observed were a random sample of cases from the total population of COVID-19 cases that will be observed in Colombia at the end of the pandemic, which is reasonable given that the country has several weeks with sustained local transmission. Given this assumption, and that the prevalences are exceptionally low, exact 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals were estimated. 14 Cluster at the department level were considered to consider the spatial correlation of observations. A locally weighted polynomial regression was fitted between each morbidity and age (continuous) to identify patterns of association. This regression was chosen because it uses a nonparametric method, where the assumptions of conventional regressions can be relaxed. 15 This bivariate exploration included as dependent variable the presence or not of multimorbidity, for each type of pattern, age as the exposure variable, and sex as confounder. Finally, we proposed three simple qualitative models of multimorbidity for COVID-19 using configurations described by Valderas et al. 4 The analyses were performed with the statistical software Stata 16 (Stata Corporation, USA).Ethical considerations. This study was carried out during a sanitary crisis. Data was collected by territorial health secretaries and organized by the Colombian National Institute of Health, and it was freely available to the public in its webpage. There was no access to personal data or variables that allowed the identification or localization of the participants. This study was considered as an response to the World Health Organization´s call of ""… to learn as much as possible as quickly as possible, in order to inform the ongoing public health response, and to allow for proper scientific evaluation of new interventions being tested"". 16 Obtained results were informed to the Colombian Ministry of Health to support health policies during the pandemic.In this study, 1 488 deaths were analyzed and 61% of them occurred in men. The mean of age of the fatal outcomes was 67.59 years (median: 69 years; percentiles: p 10 = 46, p 25 = 58, p 75 = 79, p 90 = 86 years) and only 27.19% of the deaths occurred among people under 60 years. Table 1 shows the main health conditions accompanying COVID-19 infection, with their respective prevalences and 95% confidence intervals, according to the age groups (under 60, and 60 years and more). Prevalences of respiratory, cardiovascular or kidney diseases, stroke, HBP + cardiovascular disease, HBP + respiratory disease, HBP + chronic kidney disease were higher among individuals with 60 or more years. Obesity was more frequent among under 60 years old. Figure 1 shows that multimorbidity prevalence increases markedly among those over 80 years. Figure 2 shows the probability of each morbidity according to age, considered separately. In general, there is a tendency to increase the probability of each morbidity with increasing age, and only high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and kidney chronic disease tend to be linear. In contrast, obesity decreases the probability of occurrence with increasing age, whereas smoking, thyroid disease, cancer, autoimmune disease, and HIV have not a clear trend towards increase or decrease. In short, among the fatal cases of COVID-19, the occurrence of multimorbidities is positively associated with age, as is known. One of the exceptions is obesity, which is more frequent in fatal young cases. This is also shown by the fact that obesity has a higher occurrence in fatal cases in young people. Figure 3 shows the probability of each pattern of multimorbidity according to the 12 top complex health conditions (COVID-19 + two or more health conditions) according to age. In these cases, the relationships are heterogeneous and non-linearity is common. The COVID-19 + high blood pressure + diabetes pattern has an inverted U distribution and it is very important due to its relative high prevalence. It contrasts with the linear relationship of COVID-19 + high blood pressure + respiratory disease. In summary, not all multimorbidity increases with age, as is commonly thought.Findings of this study indicate that multimorbidity is an important phenomenon to consider in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The co-occurrences of COVID-19 with different combinations of diseases including high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, obesity, cardiovascular, respiratory, and CKD have a high frequency among individuals deceased by COVID-19 in Colombia and other countries. Identification of these multimorbidity patterns among individuals diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection could provide insights for patient triage for hospitalization, and basic care at home according to the estimated risk.Moreover, identification of non-infected individuals with highrisk ages and specific multimorbidity patterns could serve to define possible interventions of selective confinement or special management.The top six morbidities identified have a strong relationship with age (HBP, respiratory disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, CKD, and obesity). Most of these six associations were positive but not linear, except obesity and diabetes where the association decreases with age after a turning point. Given that these results are conditional on death, these relationships could mainly be explained by survivor bias, since diabetes and obesity are not only more prevalent in young adults, but also, in turn, this is the effect of higher mortality before 60 years of age. However, the importance of this finding is that it precisely identifies that diseases such as obesity and diabetes are more relevant in adults younger than 60 years as potential factors associated with COVID-19 fatality. Other diseases such as thyroid disease, HIV, autoimmune disease, stroke, and cancer seem to be important, although not age-related. These diseases seem to be important regardless of age as factors associated with fatal outcomes of COVID-19 infection.With the multimorbidity classification by Valderas et al 4 it is possible to identify that among individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 there are different types of multimorbidity. We propose that there are least three possible models between COVID-19 and chronic diseases ( figure 4) . In the first model, chronic disease is an effect modifier of SARS-CoV-2 infection, increasing the risk of complications and severity. The second model incorporates the existence of common causes associated with the chronic disease and related clinical or social factors. Finally, in model 3 there is only a temporary concurrence of the chronic disease and COVID-19 infection, but there is neither relationship among them, nor they have common causes. To determine which configurations are more frequent and which ones apply to each chronic disease, cohort studies that consider the nature of these relationships are required.In response to this situation with different etiological models, it is possible to improve the proposed guidelines for managing chronic diseases when they co-occur with COVID-19. For instance, guidelines for COVID-19 individuals with high blood pressure, 17 diabetes, 18, 19 cardiovascular disease, 20 kidney disease, 21 metabolic and bariatric surgery, 22 endocrine surgery, 23 lung cancer, 24 stroke, 25 and systemic sclerosis. 26 There are also recommendations for older adults with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. 27, 28 These types of practices and discussions associated with the proposed changes to manage patients are evidence of the complexity of COVID and the associated multimorbidity. However, the more difficult cases will be individuals with COVID-19 and complex diseases with low prevalence.Multimorbidity should be understood as a vulnerability condition itself, and more than the additive sum of chronic diseases. Multimorbidity is like a concentration of expressions in a unique health-disease process, which means that it's the joint result of the risk factors and pathophysiological changes associated with each of the health conditions involved. Among older adults, this medical complexity configures the frailty syndrome, 29 that affects physiological reserves and multiple systems, making older adults more susceptible to complications and death from COVID-19, like from other diseases. This could explain the well-recognized relationship between age and severity in COVID-19, which is undoubtedly measured by multimorbidity.For this reason, in this study multimorbidity was included as an underlying latent variable in our analysis. Similar experiences were found with the Patient-Centered Clinical Method (PCCM) questionnaire in Canada, where the complexity of multimorbidity and associated factors can be comparable. 30 There are even other analyses comparing ways of approaching multimorbidity, which suggests that hierarchical cluster analysis shows comorbidity, while exploratory factor analysis multimorbidity. 31 Subsequent analyses can use this approach to build scales of risk of death and complications. In addition, diseases that co-occur in time and place configure the existence of a syndemic. For Singer and Clair, a syndemic occurs because there are social characteristics that are acting as determinants, so adequate management requires a more comprehensive approach. 32 In this case, COVID-19 co-occurs with different multimorbidity patterns, which is specific to a complex emergent disease.Results presented here should be interpreted taking into account some methodological limitations. First, in this study other conditions that have been used in multimorbidity indices were not available: (osteo)arthritis, hearth failure, depression, osteoporosis, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, vision problems, dementia, hearing problems and angina pectoris 13 . Colombian official database only includes the 10 conditions reported in this study. However, with the exception of heart failure and angina, all other conditions have higher prevalences among older adults. For this reason, they would not be directly associated with the risk of becoming infected or dying from COVID-19. Heart failure and angina would be covered by the label ""cardiovascular disease"", so we consider that the most relevant morbidities associated with COVID-19 severity were considered. Another limitation is related to the non-inclusion of socioeconomic health conditions, disability and functional dependence, geriatric syndromes, and mental health problems (mainly depression and dementia). Although their relationship with the probability of death is more direct, if they are theoretically part of multimorbidity from a broader perspective 8 , and could indirectly affect the clinical outcome of the disease, by affecting access to health services, adherence to treatment or its effectiveness, as well as the biological interaction of the underlying conditions. Although the analyses presented here are limited to the patterns of multimorbidity with the highest occurrence, it is important to note that this situation can occur with diseases of lesser occurrence (including neglected diseases) which could be important in some regions. In this case, the medical care becomes a big challenge for clinicians.In conclusion, in this study the patterns of multimorbidity among people diagnosed with COVID-19 in Colombia during the acute period of infection were presented. Undoubtedly, in the future, more multimorbidity patterns will be known. Similar analyses in different regions that incorporate the different epidemiological patterns 33 may facilitate the care of people with COVID-19, and the prevention of transmission among highrisk populations.Author contributions.

ca2cc5157776c5c5198139cbadbaaaea03e2a8a2,"Modelling the Test, Trace and Quarantine Strategy to Control the COVID-19 Epidemic in the State of São Paulo, Brazil","Despite lockdowns in China, SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly throughout the world by predicted routes of transportation (Bogoch et al., 2020) and spread faster than any other emerging infectious disease in recent decades (Angelo et al., 2019; Halstead & Wilder-Smith, 2019; Tuite et al., 2019; Wilder-Smith, Chang, & Leong, 2019) . The first case of COVID-19 in Latin America was confirmed on 26 February 2020, in the São Paulo metropolis, the most populous city in the Southern hemisphere (~12 million people) (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística, 2020). Travel reports and subsequent genetic analyses confirmed that the first detected infection was acquired via importation of the virus from Northern Italy Jesus et al., 2020) .Since then, Brazil has reported the largest number of cases in Latin America (4, 238, 446 reported cases and 129,522 deaths as of 11 September 2020) (Ministério da Saúde do Brasil, 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly within Brazil , often associated with urban centers with social deprivation and has now been detected in the majority of the 27 federal states of Brazil. Using transmission pairs of SARS-CoV-2 reported to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the mean and standard deviation for the serial interval was estimated to be 2.97 and 3.29 days respectively (Prete et al., 2020) .Social distancing, stay-at-home policies and discontinuation of mass gatherings up to complete lockdowns are important tenets of public health measures to mitigate the explosive growth of COVID-19 (Wilder-Smith & Freedman, 2020) . However, the most effective public health measures include liberal testing, prompt isolation of all test 3 positive persons, contact tracing of all test positive cases and enforced quarantining of all contacts (Hellewell et al., 2020; Salathe et al., 2020) .Here we set out to model the number of infections and deaths depending on the timing and extent of testing and contact tracing in the State of Sao Paulo, the most populous state of Brazil with 44,639,899 inhabitants (Biblioteca Virtual do Estado de São Paulo, 2020) .The model's dynamics is described by the following set of differential equations:The Basic Reproduction Number of system (1) is given by:The incidence of infection is given by:The total number of COVID-19-related deaths is given by:Finally, the total number of tested individuals is given by:Data on the cumulative number of reported cases and deaths were obtained from Seade (Fundação Sistema Estadual de Análise de Dados do Estado de São Paulo). Data on the number of ICU patients were obtained from SIMI (Sistema de Monitoramento Inteligente do Estado de São Paulo). A fitting procedure based on the Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least-squares algorithm was used to fit the model's parameters simultaneously to the data on cases, deaths and ICU patients. We used the R package minpack.lm (Elzhov et al., 2016) .We assumed that the potentially infective contact rate, the notification ratio, and the ICU admission rate change every 10 days. (As it will be explained in another paper this simulates the propagation of the disease and compliance with social distancing rules). The parameter values used are shown in Table 1 .We fitted the model's parameters simultaneously to the data of cumulative number of reported cases and deaths (Figures 2(a) and 2(b), respectively), and the number of ICU patients for the state of São Paulo until July 18, 2020. To estimate a 95% probability interval (shaded area in Figure 2 ), we assumed a normal distribution for the contact rate with a standard deviation of 1.5%. The fitted parameters are shown in Table 1 .The results for the strategy that considers testing infected (symptomatic and asymptomatic/oligosymptomatic) individuals are shown in Figure 4 . The testing strategy efficacies as a function of the total number of tests and corresponding costs in US dollars are shown in Figures 4(a) and 4(b) , respectively, for different dates of start.In Figures 3 and 4 , each dot corresponds to a different daily testing rate and the dot size is proportional to the testing rate. Dot sizes and corresponding testing rates can be observed in Figure 5 , in which we observe that higher testing rates and earlier start dates are more efficacious.We modelled and simulated a test-trace-and-quarantine strategy to control the COVID-19 outbreak in the State of São Paulo, Brasil. The State of São Paulo failed to adopt an effective social distancing strategy, reaching at most 59% in late March and started to relax the measures in late June, dropping to 42% in 11 September (Sistema de Monitoramento Inteligente do Estado de São Paulo, 2020). Therefore, São Paulo relies heavily on a massive testing strategy in the attempt to control the epidemic.Our model has the following limitations. The model assumes a perfect test with 100% sensitiviy and specificity; we also assumed that tracing the contacts of the positive cases would be perfect, which is obviously a practical impossibility. Another important limitation of the model is that it does not consider any delay in the results of the test, an important factor that has been limiting this strategy in many places of the world (Kretzschmar et al., 2020) . Although the current tests have a delay of many days to present the results, many rapid-molecular point of care tests for detecting positive patients to SARS-CoV-2 are in development (Ahmad et al., 2020) , so the delay in test results can be overcome. However, our model does not take into account social inequity in accessing testing Martins-Filho et al., 2020) . Some strategies could be considered to reduce the testing costs like pooling samples for testing (Abid et al., 2020) or concentrating the tests in neighborhood where sewege systems were tested positive (Foladori et al., 2020) .Had the State of São Paulo decided to adopt this strategy on April the 1 st , it would have been possible to reduce the total number of cases in 90% at a cost of 2.25 billion US dollars for the indiscriminate strategy but at a much smaller cost of 125 million US dollars for the selective testing of symptomatic cases and their contacts. We conclude that a selective test, trace and quarantine strategy is the most cost effective strategy that could be applied in situations where social distancing is difficult to implement.",Brazil,first author,2020-12-04,12
91c8b6f558eb5867bed3ab6c5980a842d9a73f61,Impact of social isolation due to COVID-19 on the seasonality of pediatric respiratory diseases,"Respiratory tract diseases are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in children under the age of 5 years, constituting the highest rate of hospitalization in this age group [1, 2] . In developing countries, diseases of the lower respiratory tract represent about 90% of deaths from respiratory diseases, most of which are bronchial and alveolar infections of viral origin [1, 3] . Regarding upper respiratory infections (URI), infants and preschoolers develop, on average, six to eight infections per year [4] . This infection profile, despite not causing serious illness, is responsible for epidemics due to the continuous circulation of pathogens in the community [5] .In this context, it is important to highlight the role of day-care centers and schools that start in increasingly younger age groups and several studies point out as being an important risk factor for the acquisition of respiratory infections, especially in children from zero to two years of age, due to greater children's exposure to infectious agents, confinement and agglomeration. In addition, children can act as sources of infection in their families, further spreading infectious agents in the community [5, 6] .In the year 2020, due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19, social isolation, with the closing of trade and companies and the suspension of classes, was highly recommended in an attempt to reduce the spread of the virus. The impact caused by social isolation was one of the factors that may have contributed to the change in the seasonal characteristic of respiratory diseases in pediatrics in the year in question [7] .In Brazil, social isolation measures that were included suspending classes at schools and universities, closing companies and commerce and banning events, have been started in mid-March. The easing of these measures began in mid-July, however, schools and day care remain closed [8] .The present study aims to determine the incidence of hospitalizations for respiratory diseases in childhood in the last 5 years and to assess the impact of social isolation due to COVID-19 on the seasonal behavior of these diseases.A cross-sectional study was carried out by collecting epidemiological data on hospital admissions for respiratory diseases in pediatric patients, at private hospital from January 2015 to July 2020. Patients aged 0 to 17 years were included, who needed of hospitalization with diagnoses of respiratory diseases. Our institution is a tertiary level private hospital that providence approximately 3,000 admissions per yearAfter approval of the project by the Research Ethics Committee of the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, a survey was made of all patients aged 0 to 17 years who were hospitalized with primary and secondary diagnosis of respiratory diseases (International Disease Code, 10th Revision: J00 -J99) from January 2015 to July 2020. The database was delivered to the researchers anonymously and, for this reason, the informed consent term was waived by the ethics and research committee.The variables used for analysis were date of admission, date of discharge, length of stay, age, sex and diagnosis. To make the analysis possible, the diagnoses were grouped using the subcategories by similarity criteria into upper airway infection (URI) asthma / bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The exact grouping of the ICD-10 codes into each subcategory was specified in Table 1 . Asthma and bronchitis were grouped because diagnosis of bronchitis was closely associated with the secondary diagnosis of asthma.The data were described by means of absolute and relative frequencies for categorical variables and by mean values and standard deviations (SD), minimum, maximum and quartiles for numerical variables. The distributions of continuous variables were investigated using boxplots and histograms.Generalized linear models with Gamma distribution and logarithmic link function were adjusted to estimate the length of hospital stay and to investigate associations with periods of social isolation Categorical variables were compared between groups with or without social isolation due to COVID-19 using chi-square or Fisher's exact testsThe number of hospitalizations over time and their relationship with social isolation was assessed by a time series regression model, with ARIMA identification. The model considered the monthly numbers of hospitalizations for respiratory diseases in pediatric patients in the first semester and social isolation in the period from April to June 2020 was used as an explanatory variable, with the coefficient and p-value for the absence of alteration test being presented. and the level of significance adopted was 5%.The analyzes were performed with the aid of the SPSS program (version 24.0) and the R (version 4.0.2) and the additional packages: forecast, Rcmdr, RcmdrPlugin.EZR and lmtest. For all analyzes, the 5% significance level was adopted.The database contained 2618 records and hospitalizations, of which 382 were excluded, as they had primary and secondary diagnoses that did not meet the study's inclusion criteria. Thus, 2236 admissions were included in the study.The main demographic characteristics as well as the presentation of the main diagnoses are shown in Table 2 .The main demographic characteristics as well as the presentation of the main diagnoses are shown in Table 1 . This table also shows the comparisons between period with (April/2020 -June/2020) or without social isolation (January/2015 -march/2020). Children under 5 years old accounted for 81.3% of hospitalizations for respiratory disease in the period without social isolation. During social isolation we observed a significant reduction, with children under 5 #: mean and 95% confidence interval estimated by generalized linear model. For those with less than one day in the hospital, we assumed three hours of stay, which equates to 0,125 days of hospitalization years old representing 45% of hospitalizations (p-value = 0.002). We also observed a reduction in the length of hospital stay (p-value = 0,005). The distribution of the number of hospitalizations per trimester in the period from 2015 to 2020, total and according to diagnosis is shown in Fig 1. In the ARIMA model, we observed in the period with social isolation (April to June 2020) an average reduction of 38 hospitalizations for respiratory diseases in pediatric patients (coefficient: -37.66; 95% confidence interval: -68.17 to -7, 15; p = 0.016).The distribution behavior of the total number of admissions and hospitalizations diagnosed with pneumonia is quite similar given the proportion of pneumonia cases (over 60%). This predominance of pneumonia cases can also be seen in Fig 2 that shows the distribution of inpatient diagnoses by age group.Evidence of association of the age group with the diagnosis of hospitalization was found (p <0.001) (Table 3) , with highlights for greater proportions of cases of pneumonia in the age groups from three years old than in the age group of zero to two years and all cases bronchiolitis in the range up to two years of age. In the multiple comparisons, no difference was found between the groups of 3 to 5 years old and 11 to 17 years old.In Fig 3, we see the distribution of the number of hospitalizations per month in the period from 2015 to 2020 for each age group in which the predominance of the age group from a to 2 years is observed very clearly, mainly in the months of seasonal peaks. Our study describes the epidemiological profile of hospitalizations for respiratory diseases in the last 5 years and brings evidence that social isolation has significantly reduced hospitalizations for respiratory diseases in the pediatric population. p-values for the chi-square test (1) and Fisher's exact test (2) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243694.t003Hospitalizations for respiratory diseases in children and adolescents usually present a distribution pattern dependent on the age group [1, 2] and seasonality [9] .In our study, children under 5 years old represented 81% of hospitalizations and pneumonia were the main diagnoses (over 65%) in all age groups, however, with a higher proportion of pneumonia cases in the age group from three years. Respiratory diseases of viral etiologies (infections of upper airways, bronchiolitis) are cited as being more common in the pediatric population [9, 10] , which contradicts our founds. However, other studies corroborate our results and point to pneumonia as a diagnosis in more than 50% of all hospitalizations for respiratory diseases [2, 11, 12] .In our study, when comparing the period with isolation and without isolation, we observed a significant increase in the percentage of hospitalizations in the group of 6 to 10 years. Kuitunen I et al found no difference in the age distribution of patients in periods with and without isolation [13] . We believe that this percentage increase in the number of hospitalizations in the 6 to 10 age group is related to the drastic reduction in the number of hospitalizations during the isolation period. During this period, only 20 patients required hospitalization for respiratory diseases.Several studies confirm the occurrence of a seasonal peak in respiratory diseases and point to an association with environmental factors such as tobacco exposure, humidity, temperature and an increase in the level of pollutants [14] [15] [16] . Sudden changes in temperatures associated with the worsening of the quality of the inspired air are contributing factors for a significant increase in cases of pneumonia, asthma and bronchiolitis [17, 18] . Our results also Other factors such as the presence of siblings and crowding are also associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for respiratory diseases [12] . Attendance to daycare centers and schools are also identified as contributing factors, not only in the increase in the incidence of respiratory diseases in childhood, but also in the maintenance of the circulation of pathogens [19, 20] .The pandemic caused by COVID-19 in 2020 and the significant reduction in the number of hospitalizations for respiratory diseases in the pediatric population observed by our study demonstrates that, agglomerations and attendance at daycare centers and schools, have a greater contribution share than if could study, as they are difficult to control variables in routine situations.Another 2 recently published studies confirm our findings and strongly suggest that social distancing and other lockdown strategies are effective to slow down the spreading of respiratory diseases and decreasing the need for hospitalization among children [13, 21] .Since then, the exponential growth in the number of cases, resulting in the collapse of the health system in different countries, has led several governments to adopt control measures to reduce the levels of transmission [22, 23] . These measures included suspending classes at schools and universities, closing companies and commerce and banning events. A study that evaluated the effectiveness of adopting such measures in slowing the growth rates of COVID-19 cases demonstrated that this has a direct association with the time of the epidemic in which they were adopted. In Italy and Spain, control measures were taken at the national level in a final stage of the epidemic, which may have contributed to the high spread of COVID-19 in these countries. In Brazil, the measures adopted prevented the collapse of the health system and appear to have an influence on the growth curve of new infections by COVID-19 [7, 8] .In addition to social isolation measures, the education of the population in relation to the use of masks and hand hygiene were also factors that contributed to curb the circulation of pathogens. Rare were cases of bronchiolitis, highly prevalent diseases at this time of year [24, 25] .Historically, since the Spanish flu, we have not had this spectrum of social isolation including closing schools and daycare centers. This fact transformed the seasonality model of pediatric respiratory diseases. Currently, we only have the question: What will 2021 be like?The social isolation measures adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically interfered with the seasonality of childhood respiratory diseases. This was reflected in the unexpected reduction in the number of hospitalizations in the pediatric population during this period. ",Brazil,first author,2020-12-11,12

SHORT TITLE: Experience in telemedicine by MS and/or NMOSD experts,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel disease entity caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus that has recently spread throughout the world. (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020) On February 25th 2020, Brazil was the first country in South America to report a case of COVID-19. Currently, a continuous increase in the number of mild, severe and fatal cases has been reported in most South American countries. On April 14th, our region registered more than 65,000 cases. (Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2020) Since then, the pandemic is testing the response capacity of Latin American public healthcare systems like never before. Most Latin American countries' healthcare systems have limited ability to respond to the outbreak due to the already overwhelming demand generated by and other ongoing health emergencies. (Litewka and Heitman, 2020) At the same time, healthcare systems have been obliged to transition and adapt expeditiously in the face of the pandemic, shifting their traditional appointment system to a virtual mode by telemedicine or phone calls. All possible avoidance of contact with the hospital and other medical institutions has also been recommended. For example, in response to the pandemic, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) has published recommendations for implementing a telemedicine service, suggesting that general neurological examination is feasible remotely, although with certain caveats.(American Academy of Neurology, 2020) Multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are chronic, predominantly immune-mediated diseases of the central nervous system and are one of the main causes of neurological disability in young adults globally. (Huda et al., 2019; Tur et al., 2018) Over the past few months, decision-making about MS and NMOSD patients has become even more complex in clinical practice in order to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Ricardo et al., 2020) MSIF guidelines recommend that MS patients should take extra care to minimize their exposure to the virus and use alternatives to face-to-face medical appointments.(Multiple Sclerosis Intenational Federation, 2020) Although telemedicine has been proposed as a potential solution to avoid SARS-CoV-2 virus exposure, the experience in our region is limited. (Keane, 2007) As the pandemic gradually worsens, there is scarce data on the responses that MS and NMOSD experts are taking in clinical practice. The present survey aimed at gathering data on experiences of MS and NMOSD experts across our region in the outpatient setting with a focus on telemedicine management.A cross-sectional study was performed using Google forms. An anonymous, voluntary, webbased survey was designed in order to investigate experiences on the follow-up of South American MS and NMOSD patients with a focus on telemedicine. The survey was sent via email (July 3rd, 2020) to potential respondents and was available online for one week only to avoid bias regarding epidemic change in our region. The questions were developed based on consensus among the authors and focused on issues raised during the COVID-19 pandemic that warranted further exploration. Respondents were identified from the Demyelinating Disease Working Group of Neurological Society from Argentina (AR), Chile (CH), Colombia (CO) and Brazil (BR).1-Basic demographics (age, gender, country and years in practice). Neurologists were also asked to indicate whether they identified themselves as experts in MS, NMOSD, or both.2-Practice prior to the pandemic and practice changes due to pandemic: telemedicine, number of appointments, neurological examination, use of scales, use of personal protective equipment (PPE).Potential confounders included the possibility that the survey could be taken twice by the same individual. Nonetheless, given the desire to preserve anonymity, we chose not to track respondents or require sign-in but rather encouraged neurologists to take the survey only once. There were no missing data, as all questions were marked as mandatory to be answered in order to send the survey. Demographics and most variables are reported as frequencies, percentages or means. Comparisons of groups of states used Fisher exact tests.A total of 141 South American MS and/or NMOSD experts from AR, CH, CO and BR were invited to participate, and 129 (91.48%) completed the survey. Demographics are highlighted in Table 1 . The highest number of responses were from AR (56 respondents).Mean age was 41.23 ±10.20, and 44% of the neurologists work at public hospitals. Medical appointments (virtual or face-to-face) decreased by approximately 50% during the pandemic era (14.78 ±16.71 and 7.43 ±9.68 patients/week before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively). The majority of neurologists continued face-to-face medical appointments (83.7%). Most frequent causes were: ""first neurological appointment"" (91.8%), ""therapeutic failure"" (94.5%) and ""management of a relapse"" (97.3%). Only 20% use the face-to-face medical appointment for a routine patient control. To decrease virus exposure, only 40% performed a complete and thorough neurological evaluation, and most of them avoid funduscopy ( Figure 1 ). When seeing patients, 56% of respondents reported their institution provided PPE. PPE for the majority of respondents consisted of at least a mask and goggles. Table 1 General characteristics of the survey responses Insert here Figure 1 Neurological evaluation performed in face to face and telemedicine appointment.Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, only 19.4% of neurologists had experience in telemedicine and, strikingly, no Brazilian neurologist had (26.8% AR, 0% BR, 23.3% CH, and 30% CO).However, 79.8% are currently using telemedicine (89.3% AR, 75.8% BR, 60% CH, and 100% CO). Most use video calls (52.3%). Using telemedicine, 44.1% of the experts were able to carry out neurological examinations, although the majority were not able to evaluate the sensitivity and visual test (Figure 1) Figure 2 ). Regarding relapse, 85.6% of the experts believe they are able to identify a relapse via telemedicine, and 52.3% advised to treat directly with oral corticoids without the necessity of a face-to-face appointment. Table 2 Telemedicine experience between South Americans MS experts PPE for the majority of respondents consisted of at least one N95 mask, a gown and gloves. (Sharma et al., 2020) Prior to the pandemic, 19.4% of South American neurologists had experience in telemedicine, despite that it had been used in a number of projects throughout South America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela). However, only a few groups had implemented a sustainable telemedicine service. (Keane, 2007) Additionally, there are no previous reports of its use in patients with MS or NMOSD. Therefore, it is important to emphasize the rapid changes in MS and NMOSD patient care practices that have been made in the last few months. Nearly 80% of MS and/or NMOSD experts are currently using telemedicine. In a recent publication, Alonso et. al. showed that 67% of Latin American neurologists were using telemedicine in early April 2020, (Ricardo et al., 2020) though this study also included MS and/or NMOSD experts from Central America, the Caribbean and Mexico. If only Argentina is considered (with the largest number of respondents in both surveys), telemedicine used over the last three months increased from 62% to 89%. (Ricardo et al., 2020) Telemedicine could be a suitable monitoring option and a potential solution to minimize exposure to the virus for MS and NMOSD patients. Different recommendations have been published since the beginning of the pandemic, most of which suggest that appointments for MS care should preferably be done by telemedicine (video call or phone). Consequently, many MS centers are utilizing telemedicine to avoid nonessential hospital visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. (Brownlee et al., 2020; Giovannoni et al., 2020) A recent review involving 28 studies and 3252 participants showed that telemedicine has been demonstrated to be technically feasible in MS patient care practice . (Yeroushalmi et al., 2019) Additionally, telemedicine has previously been validated as a tool for assessing disability in MS with high patient acceptability. (Bove et al., 2019) In our survey, less than 40% of respondents continue to use the EDSS as Tele-EDSS. However, there is evidence that remote assessment of neurological disability in people with MS using EDSS is feasible using telemedicine without an aide at the patient's location. Bove R. et. al. developed and validated a telemedicine-based MS disability examination that does not require an in-home examiner. In this study, 41 adults with MS were recruited after a standardized in-person EDSS evaluation, and within 1 week underwent a blinded Tele-EDSS examination. The mean difference between EDSS and Tele-EDSS was 0.34 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07-0.61). In almost 90% of evaluations, both scores were within 1 point of similarity and the overall correlation between both EDSS was 0.89 (p < 0.0001). (Bove et al., 2019) On other hand, almost half of experts are currently using PDDS to replace EDSS in remote examination. PDDS is strongly correlated to EDSS, mainly in the visual, cerebellar, pyramidal, sensory, bowel/bladder and ambulatory functional systems. It has also been validated in multiple languages and as an online tool. (Lavorgna et al., 2017) Therefore, PPDS could become a recommended tool to measure the evolution of patients treated with oral corticosteroids. (Learmonth et al., 2013) A recent review evaluated the available tools for tele-neurology examination in MS, including PROMs. Overall, authors suggested a battery for assessing disability and relapses using a composite tool: PDDS and SDMT as cognitive tests. Moreover, they recommended the MSIS-29 before the appointment, so that neurologists have a comprehensive view of the physical and psychological status. (Moccia et al., 2020) The oral version of the SDMT has already been validated for remote use (Silva et al., 2018) and, regarding the MS Impact Scale , it has also been tested for remote application. Concerning relapse diagnosis, most of the experts believe they are able to identify a relapse via telemedicine, and half of neurologists advised direct treatment with oral corticoids without the need for a face-to-face appointment.Additionally, other authors have suggested a battery for identifying relapses through telemedicine; (Moccia et al., 2020) most likely, one of the greatest difficulties is not being able to rule out a pseudo-relapse. If a pseudo-relapse is ruled out, the use of high-dose oral corticosteroids in acute relapse treatment would be a good therapeutic option and can avoid admitting the patient to the hospital. (Burton et al., 2012; Le Page et al., 2015; Repovic, 2019) We recognize certain limitations to this study. The survey questions were not validated and were developed by a consensus decision among the authors, which could have generated biases. Furthermore, we had representation from only 4 of 14 South American countries. As we do not know the total number of MS and/or NMOSD experts on our continent, we cannot establish whether our study is a representative sample. Another drawback is that the survey did not allow a determination of the type of areas (urban or rural) within our countries. There is certainly a notable difference between neurologists living in rural areas from those in large cities. This is important since hospitals, especially university hospitals and specialist centers, are usually located in the larger cities and with better access to technology.This is the first report regarding the use of telemedicine for South American MS and NMOSD patient follow-up. Our results highlight that while the continent is still developing and health systems suffer from underfunding, MS and NMOSD experts have demonstrated the ability to quickly transition and adapt in the face of the pandemic using telemedicine. It is remarkable how they have been obliged to establish protocols that minimize MS and NMOSD patient exposure to the virus and, at the same time, decrease their own exposure. The experience gained in this pandemic should lead to the formulation of actions with an eye to the future.We wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome.We confirm that we have given due consideration to the protection of intellectual property associated with this work and that there are no impediments to publication, including the timing of publication, with respect to intellectual property.

c679156e5a16420149cbcfc1f316fffc955af432,,"capture not only deaths directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic but also deaths from other diseases that resulted from indirect effects of the pandemic. (Olson et al., 2020) . For this analysis, daily mortality data from the National Institute of Statistics and Census (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos, 2020), the National Civil Registry (Dirección General del Registro Civil, Identificación y Cedulación, 2020) and the National Risk and Emergency Management Service (Servicio Nacional de Gestión de Riesgos y Emergencias, 2020) of Ecuador were used. All-cause excess deaths for any day were estimated as the difference between the number of observed deaths from all causes and the estimate of expected deaths from all causes obtained for that day from historical data. To obtain estimates of expected deaths from all causes for the period of March 17 to October 22, 2020 we used forecasts from a statistical model built on daily mortality data from the period January 1, 2014 to March 16, 2020. This is a similar approach to that used by Blanton et al. (2007) and Olson et al. (2020) . Different models of exponential smoothing, cubic smoothing splines, simple moving average and ARIMA were considered for this study. These methods have been used in similar studies (see e.g., Adair et al., 2020; Rossen et al., 2020; Vieira et al., 2020) . To compare the forecast performance of these models we used out-of-sample (OOS) testing with rollingwindows (Tashman, 2000) on the model-building dataset. In particular, the fit period was successively set to start on March 17 and end on March 16 of the following year to produce forecasts for the subsequent test period of March 17 to October 22. Because mortality data were available from January 1, 2014 onwards, the first fit period was set from January 1, 2014 to March 16, 2015. Five fit-test periods were generated in total in the model-building dataset. Note that this evaluation procedure emulates the forecast problem of this study. We used as measure of performance the root mean squared error J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (RMSE) computed from the observed and forecasted values in the five testing periods considered. For each method, only the model with the lowest RMSE estimate in the OOS evaluation is displayed in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1 , the ARIMA model of order (3,0,1) with drift shows the best forecast performance and was therefore selected for the analysis. Figure 1 shows the estimated curve of excess mortality based on this model and compares it with the daily number of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths in the period January 1 to October 22, 2020. Note that the sequence of bars for the daily numbers of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths shows a pattern similar to the curve of excess mortality, except for being shifted to the right, which may reflect reporting delays by national institutions during the pandemic. Note also that the levels of estimated excess mortality in general exceed those of the number of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths. This difference may represent deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 that were not officially reported but also deaths from other diseases that resulted from indirect effects of the pandemic, such as the fear of being treated in hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients or a shortage of medication, physicians, intensive care unit beds, ventilators or a general lack of access to healthcare services.These results suggest that the real impact of the pandemic in Ecuador was much worse than indicated by reports from national institutions. Estimates of all-cause excess mortality might provide a better approximation of the true COVID-19 death toll. From March 17 to October 22, 2020, a total of 80,108 deaths from all causes were registered in Ecuador, of which 36,922 (95% bootstrap confidence interval: 32,314-42,696) were estimated to be in excess of expected levels. As shown in Figure 1 -Levels of all-cause mortality from December 24, 2019 to December 31, 2019 were lower compared to all-cause deaths registered on previous days. Deaths not registered on these vacation days were probably only registered on January 1, 2020, and as result excess mortality was estimated to be much higher than 0 for that day.Levels of deaths in the period March 13, 2020 to March 19, 2020 were also unusually low and as a result negative estimates of excess deaths were obtained in a systematic way for those days. These results were obtained in a first analysis with the ARIMA (3,0,1) model with drift, which showed the best performance with the OOS J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f evaluation. To improve the fit of the model, we fitted a simple exponential smoothing model with multiplicative errors (ETS(M,N,N) ) on the time series data preceding each of these periods and used the corresponding forecasts to replace the actual values of these days. ETS(M,N,N) produced the lowest RMSE in a last block evaluation for each of these 2 periods when compared to other models of exponential smoothing, cubic smoothing splines, simple moving average and ARIMA. Reported results in Figure 1 and Table 1 are based on these modified data.-Data on confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths from the National Risk and Emergency Management Service of Ecuador were negative for some days. We set those values to 0 in the plot shown in Figure 1 .-A number of 362 probable COVID-19 deaths on October 8, 2020 appears to be an outlier with respect to levels of COVID-19 deaths around that period of time. Many of them may represent deaths that possibly occurred at an earlier point in time and that were only registered on October 8.This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.None.

93f57c940acecba5238e1a030687c02e8559daef,Self-Reported Skin Sensation by People Who Have Experienced Containment During COVID-19 Pandemic,"We first inquired about socio-demographics, sensitive skin, and self-reported changes observed during containment (dry skin, skin rash, redness, and itching). The second part addressed facial skin sensitivity. The subjects were requested to rate their skin as ""very sensitive,"" ""sensitive,"" ""slightly sensitive,"" or ""not sensitive."" Subjects with ""sensitive"" or ""very sensitive"" skin were considered to belong to the ""sensitive skin"" group, and those having ""not very sensitive"" or ""not sensitive at all"" skin belonged to the ""non sensitive skin"" group, as previously published elsewhere. 4,10- 12 We did not inquire whether respondents had been diagnosed with COVID-19. As this study did not involve any patient contact and was completely anonymous, approval from the ethical review board was not necessary.A total of 64% (n=7170) of the respondents reported that they complied with the containment procedures (Table 1) , ranging from 39% in China to 85.3% in Brazil ( Table 2) .The prevalence of skin changes ranged from 16.2% in Russia to 28% in Brazil. Women were more likely than men to report a change in their skin condition (24.7% vs 16.6%, respectively, p<0.00001). There was a positive correlation between the age and skin complaints (Spearman's rho r=0.202, p<0.01). Drier skin was the main complaint in all five countries. Overall, the three main reported complaints during containment were drier skin (44.5%), skin rash (29.3%), and greasier skin (27%). Women were more likely than men to report drier skin (48.4% vs 37.9%, respectively, p=0.0007) and skin rash (31.7% vs 25.4%, respectively, p=0.0007).A total of 40.9% of the men (n=2246) and 50.2% of the women (n=2817) reported having a ""sensitive"" skin ( Table 1) . The difference between the 2 sexes was significant (p < 0.001).Among those, 20.9% (n=1500) reported a modification of their skin in relation to containment.Patients with sensitive skin were more likely to report skin changes during containment (27.7% vs 14.8%, p<0.00001). The difference was significant for both sexes (p<0.00001). Patients with sensitive skin were more likely to report skin rash, itch and redness (Table 1) .Our study shows that women and individuals who reported sensitive skin perceived that containment was responsible for their subjective skin changes. In the current context, dryness of the skin, exacerbation of pruritus and rashes may be attributed to frequent use of soap and/or hydroalcoholic solutions, as well as to the use of facial masks outside of home. [13] [14] [15] Stress of containment and uncertainty of the global situation, as well as an exacerbation of preexisting dermatoses, cannot be excluded. Geographic and seasonal climatic variations, as well as the way of life, may also have an impact. The limitations of our study include the declarative nature of the responses. In daily practice, dermatologists must integrate the notion of containment in the anamnesis over the next months as a possible clue to cutaneous symptoms.",Brazil,abstract,2020-12-09,12
0ee3ad6031c09fad0a32d65dd491cd72dbffe8cf,,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent responsible for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic, is an RNA virus that is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).Although knowledge of COVID-19 increases daily, many aspects of its pathophysiology remain unknown. Based on currently available knowledge, a therapeutic plan has been proposed consisting of 3 courses of action: reduction of viral replication, hypercoagulability, and the uncontrolled inflammatory response. To this end, pending a definitive cure, the use of various drugs commonly used in dermatology, including antimalarials (AMs), antiparasitics, and antiandrogens, has been proposed, and several have been used therapeutically. In this review, we discuss the history and mechanism of action of these drugs, as well as their therapeutic potential in COVID-19 patients ( Fig. 1 ; Table 1 ).Antimalarials are drugs traditionally used to treat malaria, and are widely used in dermatology owing to their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and photoprotective effects, as well as their efficacy as corticosteroid-sparing agents. The main dermatological conditions for which these drugs are used include cutaneous lupus, polymorphous light eruption, and porphyria cutanea tarda.Cinchona is a native tree of South America, the bark of which was used by the indigenous peoples for its antipyretic properties. A well-known story tells of its use in 1630 to treat fever in the Spanish countess of Chinchón (wife of the viceroy of Peru), who in turn introduced it to Europe in 1640. However, some researchers believe that it was brought to Europe much earlier by Jesuit missionaries. [1] [2] [3] [4] immunomodulatory effects that could suppress the uncontrolled immune response to SARS-CoV-2. [24] [25] [26] Yao et al 27 have proposed HCQ as the ideal drug with which to treat SARS-CoV-2, thanks to its antiviral and immunomodulatory effects. The authors recommend concomitant treatment with low-dose HCQ and an anti-inflammatory to help mitigate the cytokine storm in critically ill patients.Studies of AMs have mainly focused on HCQ, which is better tolerated, has a better safety profile, and shows more potent antiviral activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 compared with CQ. 26, 27 An observational study conducted between March and April 2020 in New York in COVID -19 patients treated with HCQ (loading dose 600 mg 2 times on day 1, followed by 400 mg/d for 4 days) observed no association between the use of HCQ and intubation or death in hospitalized patients. 28 Mehra et al 29, 30 analyzed data from the national registry of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in 671 different hospitals between December 2019 and April 2020. The authors were unable to demonstrate beneficial effects of HCQ or CQ administered alone or in combination with macrolides. The pharmacological regimens described were associated with a decrease in hospital survival and a higher frequency of ventricular arrhythmias. However, 3 of study's 4 authors subsequently retracted the results owing to doubts about the veracity of the data and the analyses carried out by Surgisphere Corporation.Although multiple authors have ruled out the therapeutic use of AMs during this pandemic, Mitjà et al (March 2020) proposed its prophylactic use. However, they failed to demonstrate that its use was effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection or disease in healthy individuals exposed to those who tested positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 31, 32 Million et al (May 2020) conducted a meta-analysis of the effect of CQ and its derivatives in patients with COVID-19, and obtained conflicting findings: marked clinical improvement and increased mortality. The authors concluded that CQ derivatives decrease mortality in COVID-19 patients and expressed concern about the amount of misinformation circulating, warning that some studies lack basic definitions of treatment and are linked to conflicts of interest. They recommended against making hasty J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f conclusions and urged caution when interpreting the results of the numerous studies published every day. 33, 34 Ivermectin Ivermectin is an antiparasitic widely used in humans worldwide. In dermatology it is frequently used to treat diseases such as scabies, demodicosis, and pediculosis, and it is currently part of the pharmacological arsenal used in the management of rosacea.In 1973, Satoshi Ōmura, a microbiologist at the Kitasato Institute in Tokyo, collected soil samples from parts of Japan in search of antibacterial compounds. He selected cultures with potential medical properties and sent them to Merck, Sharp and Dohme (MSD) laboratories in New Jersey, where his collaborator William Campbell evaluated their antiparasitic effects. In 1974, a culture from a sample collected near a golf course in Kawana (Tokyo) showed remarkable effects against helminths. The bacteria isolated in the culture was Streptomyces avermectinius. Avermectin, the active compound obtained from the culture, was chemically modified to produce ivermectin, which in turn was marketed for use in animals in 1981. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] When ivermectin was found to be safe and effective, MSD in conjunction with the World Health Organization, the Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), and the Onchocerciasis Control Program (OCP) launched a study of its potential for use in humans (1982) . It was approved for use in humans in 1987 and helped to successfully combat onchocerciasis in African countries. 35, 41 In 2015, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to its discoverers, Ōmura and Campbell.Several studies show that ivermectin possesses broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Its effect has been demonstrated in vitro against certain flaviviruses, chikungunya virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. The exact mechanism underlying this effect has not yet been elucidated, but it is thought to be mediated by action at importin (IMP) α/β1, a viral protein transporter that plays a fundamental role in some RNA viruses. Ivermectin is capable of dissociating or preventing the formation of the preformed IMP α/β1 heterodimer, thereby blocking transport of viral proteins to the host cell nucleus. 42 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fPatel et al (January 2020) conducted a study that included COVID-19 patients from 169 hospitals located in North America, Europe, and Asia. The study included 704 patients treated with ivermectin (150 µg/kg) and 704 controls, and found a significantly lower mortality rate in patients treated with ivermectin. The preprint of this study is not currently available, as the authors have apparently retracted their findings due to inconsistencies in the data obtained from Surgisphere. An in vitro study by Caly et al (March 2020) reported a 99.98% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in Vero-hSLAM cell cultures 48 hours after treatment with 5 µM ivermectin. The mean inhibitory concentration of ivermectin was estimated at approximately 2 µM and the authors reported no toxicity at any of the concentrations evaluated. 42 However, Momekov and Momekova (May 2020) warned that the in vitro inhibitory concentrations reported in this study, and especially the 5 µmol/L dose, are practically unachievable using the dosage regimens described in humans to date. 43 Therefore, despite the fact that ivermectin shows important benefits, clinical trials and other studies demonstrating its effectiveness are still lacking.Androgens play an important role in metabolic homeostasis and reproductive health in both men and women, and have important physiological effects on the skin. They can also contribute to the development of certain skin diseases, including acne, androgenetic alopecia, hirsutism, and hidradenitis suppurativa. 44 Some drugs with antiandrogenic effects include cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, dutasteride, finasteride, and flutamide.Drug development began in 1962 with the steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate, chlormadinone acetate, megestrol acetate, and dienogest.Flutamide was the first nonsteroidal antiandrogen approved by the Food and Drug Administration for prostate cancer. This first-in-class drug serves as the structural basis for other nonsteroidal antiandrogens such as enzalutamide and apalutamide. 45, 46 In 1970, Dorfman defined antiandrogens as substances that prevent the expression of androgen activity.The relationship between COVID-19 and androgens may be explained by the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells. Androgens are implicated in the activity of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and the ACE-II receptor, both of which are critical for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. Although other proteases are also involved, TMPRSS2 is of particular interest; it is an androgen-regulated gene, and has been previously studied for its role in prostate cancer. [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] Numerous studies have demonstrated more frequent complications, more severe disease courses, and higher rates of mortality caused by SARS-CoV-2 in men than women, although it is unclear whether this is due to biological factors, habits, or differences in comorbidity rates. 51 These observations have prompted the scientific community to identify the factors that predispose men to a more severe clinical picture. Some researchers propose that androgens exert a crucial influence on the severity of COVID-19, as evidenced by a higher viral load, greater SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, and more severe lung involvement in male patients with a hyperandrogenic phenotype. These effects are most likely related to the aforementioned mechanism of action. 48 Goren et al (March 2020) studied the prevalence of androgenetic alopecia (AA) in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Spain. Of 41 male patients, 29 (71%) were diagnosed with clinically significant AA. 52 The authors plan to follow up on this preliminary observation and address certain limitations of their study in a clinical trial to evaluate the correlation between androgenetic alopecia and COVID-19 severity. 52 Montopoli et al (April 2020) found that prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) had a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than patients not receiving ADT (odds ratio [OR], 4.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1. 55-10.59 ). An even greater difference was observed when comparing prostate cancer patients receiving ADT with patients with any other type of cancer (OR, 4.86; 95% CI, 1.88-12.56). The authors finally concluded that ADT partially protected prostate cancer patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection. 53 A study of cardiac cells derived from human embryonic stem cells highlighted the ability of 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors to reduce ACE-II levels and, therefore, decrease viral internalization. 47 Clinical trials evaluating the effects of antiandrogens and hormonal therapy in COVID -19 are currently underway. 54, 55 Melatonin Melatonin is a derivative of the amino acid tryptophan. It is the main neuroendocrine product of the pineal gland. Until recently it was thought to exclusively regulate circadian rhythm and seasonal biorhythms. We now know that this hormonal role is merely the tip of the iceberg, and that melatonin has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, thermoregulatory, and antitumor properties, among others, suggesting promising potential despite its current limitation to the treatment of dermatological conditions. 56-58To understand the history of melatonin, we must discuss its discoverer, Aaron Lerner, an internationally renowned dermatologist and founder and chair of the Yale Department of Dermatology. He received numerous awards and recognitions for his dermatological research, but above all is known as the discoverer of melatonin.Lerner was always interested in skin pigmentation and wrote an article with Thomas Fitzpatrick in which they described the biochemistry of melanin formation and pigmentation. 59 The article was published in the journal Physiological Reviews and established both authors as world experts on the subject.Lerner conducted a study in patients with Addison disease in an attempt to identify the pituitary factor responsible for the hyperpigmentation characteristic of this pathology and, with his colleagues, discovered melanocyte-stimulating hormone.Lerner and his coworkers came to Yale in 1955. While waiting for their laboratory to be completed, a member of his team named Yoshiyata Takahashi came across a 1917 study that described how pineal extracts from cows could lighten the color of tadpoles. Lerner and his team decided to investigate whether this pineal factor was an already known molecule or something else. The study lasted 4 years and culminated with the discovery of melatonin in 1958. [60] [61] [62] In 1964, Marczynski demonstrated that melatonin is a sleep promoter. 63 Me c h a n i s m o f a c t i o n a n d u s e i n C O V ID -19Initially, COVID-19 impairs the host's immune response. SARS-CoV-2 manages to evade the innate immune response and induces apoptosis while decreasing T lymphocyte numbers. Later, accelerated viral replication leads to cell death, endothelial and vascular damage. This gives rise to massive release of inflammatory cytokines (the so-called cytokine storm), which recruit and activate non-infected immune cells, generating an excessive systemic inflammatory response with severe pulmonary repercussions. 64 Although melatonin is not a virucidal drug, it has been postulated as a useful means of mitigating the deleterious effects of Ebola, dengue, encephalomyocarditis, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses, among others. [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] The proposed use of melatonin as an adjuvant is based mainly on its ability to reduce the negative impact of the uncontrolled immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2 and to regulate and interrupt certain signaling pathways activated by this virus. Based on the pathophysiology of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, Zhang et al (2020) proposed that melatonin may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19 owing to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. 72 A notable anti-inflammatory effect of melatonin is its ability to block nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), which promotes inflammation through the production of inflammatory cytokines that in turn exacerbate and maintain systemic inflammation in COVID-19. 73, 74 Melatonin reduces IL-6 levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with chronic periodontitis and in patients with multiple sclerosis, among other diseases. [75] [76] [77] Not only is IL-6 an important mediator of the cytokine storm, but its levels have been closely correlated with the severity and outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome and with SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the blood, suggesting that reductions in IL-6 levels could benefit patients in the hyperimmune phase of COVID-19. 78 The pro-inflammatory stage of COVID-19 is characterized by the production of an excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals (FR), which are harmful to the body.Melatonin interacts directly with ROS, acting as a kind of FR scavenger. In addition, it promotes the expression of enzymes with antioxidant activity and reduces the expression of those that increase oxidative stress. 79, 80 The antioxidant effect of melatonin may also contribute to its anti-inflammatory effect. These and other aspects of the use of melatonin in COVID-19 were further investigated by Zhang et al (March 2020) in a study that was praised by several authors who have supported the use of melatonin in COVID-19. 81, 82 Other authors have emphasized the importance of including antioxidant agents in COVID-19 treatments in order to reduce the number of deaths due to cardiac complications, in which oxidative stress plays a fundamental role. 83, 84 The use of melatonin in conjunction with vitamin D, with which it would exert a powerful synergistic effect, was recently proposed. 85 Melatonin is an inexpensive and safe drug with potentially beneficial effects in COVID-19. Currently, there are 2 clinical trials underway investigating the use of melatonin to treat COVID-19. The first aims to evaluate the efficacy of melatonin for COVID-19 prophylaxis in health workers and the second is examining the efficacy and safety of intravenous melatonin in COVID-19 patients in intensive care units. 86, 87 Conclusion It is important to remember that there are many other potential drug candidates to combat COVID-19. In this review we focus exclusively on those frequently used in dermatology. These drugs, which are very different from one other, with apparently unrelated mechanisms of action, could nonetheless be useful. Some (e.g. AMs and ivermectin) have previously been used to treat viral diseases, while others (e.g. antiandrogens and melatonin) have gone somewhat unnoticed by the media, given their limited use to treat specific diseases.Given the biochemical profile of melatonin and the massive impact that the current pandemic has had on the global economy, it seems important to conduct more clinical trials to further investigate its potential for the treatment of COVID-19.An extensive review of the literature available on COVID-19 has shown us that there is an abundance of information available. However, despite the urgency of the situation, it is essential to maintain the quality and meticulousness of scientific studies, as hasty conclusions based on poorly designed studies delay and hinder the scientific process. For their part, readers can and should critically analyze the studies that are published on a daily basis.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

c82e545085f4dd747ebfa715cd989b7e3d64ba00,Performance of at-home self-collected saliva and nasal-oropharyngeal swabs in the surveillance of COVID-19,"Rapid and accurate diagnostic tests are essential for controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Nevertheless, biological specimen collection is an important logistic challenge to provide massive testing [1] [2] [3] . The possibility to use self-collected samples for COVID-19 testing offers several advantages, especially to minimize the risk of exposing health-care workers to the virus, since self-collection does not require direct involvement of trained personnel in the sample collection [4, 5] . Recently, publications have been shown a similar sensitivity between saliva samples and nasal swabs collected by health-care workers and those collected by a patient for COVID-19 molecular diagnosis, thus providing an important background for the choice of this strategy for surveillance of COVID-19 [6] [7] [8] .Saliva sampling has been described as a good alternative for SARS-CoV-2 detection, showing additional advantages compared to swab collection [9] [10] [11] [12] . Saliva collection does not cause discomfort or nasal bleeding to patients and does not require swab collectors or personal protective equipment, which are currently in short-supply in the market [3] . In addition, saliva allows examination of several biomarkers, which could be useful as molecular signatures for patient stratification regarding infection severity [10, 13, 14] .In a pandemic scenario, at-home self-collection of samples plays a key role in the surveillance and control of the infection by allowing the patient with clinical suspicion of COVID19 to have access to proper healthcare and quick isolation of the confirmed cases [4, 5] . Recently published studies show that 80-85% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV -2 have few or no symptoms, while 15-20% develop more severe disease, often associated with advanced age or other co-morbidities [15] .The Corona São Caetano program is a primary care initiative providing specific home care to all residents of São Caetano do Sul, state of São Paulo, Brazil. This program started in April 2020 due to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in the country. Selfcollection of nasal-oropharyngeal swabs has been used to obtain samples for diagnosis since the beginning of the epidemics, with excellent results, as the hospitalization rate was less than 3% among the patients enrolled in the program [16] .The aim of this study was to compare the performance of two different at-home self-collected samplessaliva and combined nasal-oropharyngeal swabs (NOP) -for COVID-19 molecular diagnosis in the community patients outside the health-care facilities.The present study was developed in a telemedicine platform for COVID-19 surveillance called 'Corona São Caetano'. Residents of the municipality aged 12 years or older who had suspected symptoms were encouraged to contact the program via a website or by phone. They were invited to complete a screening questionnaire including sociodemographic data, information on type, onset and duration of the symptoms.In the last two weeks of May 2020, a series of 201 consecutive patients participating in the program were included in the present study. The patients met the defined criteria of suspected COVID-19 (i.e., having at least two of the following symptoms: fever, cough, sore throat, coryza, change in/loss of smell [anosmia] or/and taste [ageusia]; or one of these symptoms plus at least two other symptoms consistent with COVID-19) were further evaluated. These patients were then called by a health-care professional in order to complete a risk assessment. All pregnant women and patients meeting predefined screening criteria for severe disease were advised to attend a hospital service. All the other patients were offered a home visit for self-collection of saliva and NOP samples.Patients testing RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 were followed up for 14 days (a maximum of 7 phone calls) after completion of their initial questionnaire, whereas those who tested negative were followed up in the primary health-care program. The patients were asked to contact the platform for a new consultation if they developed new symptoms.This study was conducted according to ethical standards defined by institutional and national research ethics committees and the Helsinki Declaration of 1964, including subsequent amendments or comparable ethical standards, and approved by the Clinics Hospital Research Ethics Committee of the University of São Paulo School of Medicine under protocol number 3.979.632. Informed consent was obtained from all the individuals enrolled in this study.NOP sampling were combined (both nostrils and oropharynx) using commercial flocked swabs with plastic applicators (Goodwood medical care Ltd., Jinzhou, China). Saliva samples were collected using a cotton pad device -Salivette™ (Sarstedt AG & CO. KG, Nümbrecht, Germany). In order to provide guidance on self-collection procedures, a link to an instructional video was sent to each participant before the home visit. Briefly, patients were instructed to use the swabs in both nostrils and posterior region of the mouth and put both swabs into a tube containing saline solution. For saliva collection, they were instructed to chew carefully a cotton pad for one minute and put it into a specific tube. The samples were collected during the morning hours and the participants were instructed to avoid eating, drinking or toothbrushing at least one hour before the saliva collection. In accordance with the Corona São Caetano Program procedures, samples were immediately put in a cool box (2-8°C) and stored at 4°C in a refrigerator until shipment to the lab by a specialized carrier in the afternoon the same day.To recover the saliva from the devices, the tubes were centrifuged at 5,000 g for 5 minutes. Total nucleic acid was extracted from 200 μl of the saline solution containing NOP and recovered saliva by using the NucliSENS EasyMag (BioMérieux, Durham, NC) automated DNA/RNA extraction platform.Detection of SARS-COV-2 RNA was performed by using the Altona RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0 (Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) which employs a B-COV specific probe directed to the E gene and a SARS-COV-2-specific probe directed to the S gene. Results were considered positive when one or both genes were amplified with a cycle threshold (Ct) <40.Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) was used to measure the agreement between RT-PCR-based detection of SARS-COV-2 in saliva and NOP swabs. The sensitivity of each method was calculated assuming that positive cases in either sample type represented true positives, with 95% confidence intervals being calculated by using the exact method.Next, we defined four analytic groups as follows: NOP-/saliva-(G1); NOP-/saliva+ (G2); NOP+/saliva-(G3); NOP+/saliva+ (G4). In order to identify clinical features associated with positivity in NOP and saliva, we specifically compared groups G2 to G4, G3 to G4, and G2 to G3. We used chi-squared test and Wilcoxon's rank-sum test to compare clinical features (i.e. age, gender, symptoms and onset of illness) between the patients in these groups.We then explored the relationship between the RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) and the sample type. We first analyzed group G4 (NOP+/saliva+) and assessed the association between Ct values by using the simple linear regression. Differences in the distribution of Ct values using NOP and saliva were assessed with paired Wilcoxon's rank-sum test. We also assessed the association between time from symptom onset and collection of saliva and NOP by using the simple linear regression. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. All analyses were performed by using the R Statistical Software, version 3.6.3.For the current study, 201 consecutive patients participating in the Corona São Caetano program and who met the suspected COVID-19 case definition were included. RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing was performed in samples from NOP and saliva and the results are shown in Table 1 .Overall, 16.4% (33/201) of the results were discordant giving a moderate agreement between both the sampling methods with a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.58. Overall, assuming that positive test results in either sample type represent true infections around 35% of patients (n = 70) were identified to be positive with COVID-19, while 26% (n = 52) and 27% (n = 55) were positive based on NOP or saliva detection, respectively. This corresponds to sensitivities of 74.2% (95% CI; 63.7% to 83.1%) for NOP and 78.6% (95% CI; 67.6% to 86.6%) for saliva samples. Of note, 9% (N = 18) and 7% (N = 15) resulted in saliva or NOP single positives, respectively.To investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 status in NOP and saliva and demographic and clinical features, the patients were categorized in four groups (G1 to G4) ( Table 2) ; NOP and saliva SARS-CoV-2 negative patients were grouped in G1 (NOP-/ saliva-, n = 131); NOP-/saliva+ patients in G2 (N = 18); NOP+/saliva-in G3 (n = 15) and NOP +/saliva+ in G4 (N = 37). We did not find any significant relationship regarding the demographic data of patients in the different groups, although the sex ratio may be different in G2 as compared to G4. Also, no significant correlation was found regarding clinical symptoms; only ageusia appeared to be more prevalent in patients with positivity of SARS-CoV-2 in NOP (P = 0.028). Interestingly, the delay between clinical symptoms onset and time of sample collection was significantly shorter (P < 0.05) in G4 as compared to G2 and G3, suggesting that patients with simultaneous SARS-CoV-2 positivity in NOP and saliva (G4-patients) were more prompt to quickly display clinical symptoms (Table 2) . In order to investigate the relationship between the RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) and sample type (saliva or NOP), we first compared the Ct values from G4 (NOP +/saliva+, n = 37) and assessed the association between Ct values using simple linear regression. We found a strong correlation between the Ct values in saliva and naso/ oropharyngeal samples (Figure 1 ). The coefficients of the regression lines (β) were 0.79 (P < 0.001) and 0.74 (P = 0.002) for E and S genes, respectively. A β-coefficient <1 indicated that, in patients with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in NOP and saliva (G4), Ct values tended to be higher in saliva than in NOP (also see Figure 2 (a)).Next, we compared the Ct values between the groups G3 (NOP+/saliva-) and G4 (NOP+/saliva+). It was observed that the Ct values were lower in patients positive in both NOP and saliva samples (median [IQR], 21.5 [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] ) compared to those positive only in NOP samples (29 [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] , P = 0.01, Wilcoxon's rank-sum test) for the E gene. Moreover, these results were also found for the S gene (Figure 2(b) ).Because timing of sample collection is a critical parameter of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, we further investigated the possible relationship between NOP and saliva SARS-CoV-2 detection and the delay between clinical symptom onset and timing of sample collection. Although the Ct values tended to be higher at later periods from the onset of symptoms, this did not reach statistical significance (Figure 3 ).We prospectively analyzed a cohort of patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 to assess the diagnostic performance of at-home self-collection of combined naso-oropharyngeal swabs (NOP) and saliva samples.According to our data, there was an overall significant agreement (κ coefficient value of 0.58) between the performances of saliva and NOP samples in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Assuming that positive results in either sample type represent true infections, a total of 70 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 were identified, with 52/70 being positive in NOP and 55/70 in saliva. This corresponds to sensitivities of 74.2% (95% CI; 63.7% to 83.1%) for NOP and 78.6% (95% CI; 67.6% to 86.6%) for saliva samples. We also found a strong correlation (βcoefficients <1) between the cycle threshold (Ct) values in saliva and NOP samples. However, the Ct values for the studied genes tended to be higher in saliva than in NOP samples.The use of saliva to detect SARS-CoV-2 has been extensively analyzed by different authors, showing that saliva can be used as an alternative sample to nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 molecular diagnosis [9, 10] . The sensitivity found in their studies varied from 81% to 100% [11, 12, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . The majority of the studies were conducted with hospitalized patients presenting more severe clinical forms of the disease, or patients attending a health-care unit. It is important to highlight that even with a different population and different saliva collection (i.e. cotton pad device), we found similar sensitivity values.To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first one in the literature to prospectively examine the performance of at-home self-collected saliva and NOP, in a telemedicine-based platform for COVID-19 surveillance. This is highly desirable in a pandemic scenario as it contributes to minimizing the risk of infection transmission in these settings. Additionally, it significantly reduces the workload burden of the health-care units.In our study for around 16% of the patients, the RT-PCR results gave discordant results between both sampling methods. This good overlap between both specimen types was in line with other studies where in general the agreement rate observed varied from 0.45 to 1 [11, 22] . This variation in agreement may be associated with different factors, such as clinical characteristics of the population, diagnostic kits, saliva collection methods, among others. However, these inconsistent results are likely to be related to the fact the virus can reach the oral and nasopharyngeal area with different kinetics being not always present at the same time in both sites as previously reported [23] .It has been postulated that there is a minimum of three different pathways for SARS-CoV-2 to reach the saliva: firstly, from the lower and upper respiratory tract; secondly, presence in the blood and gingival crevicular fluid; and thirdly, through salivary gland infection, with subsequent release of viral particles into the saliva via salivary ducts [10, 24, 25] . It is believed that the highest viral concentration observed in saliva is derived from the respiratory tract [12] . Therefore, the finding of viruses in saliva would be expected only in cases with a higher viral load, since the viral particles observed in the saliva also depend on the amount of viruses coming from the respiratory tract. However, the fact that in our study 9% of the samples were positive in saliva in absence of NOP positivity could be indicative that at least in a minority part the virus has salivary origin.When we compared the cases positive in both methods to those positive in NOP only, it was found that Ct values were lower in the first group. This finding reinforces the idea that the viral load has to be higher (lower Ct) in order to be positive in the saliva. Clearly, according to our results, the viral load influenced the results. Only cases with a higher viral load (lower Ct) were positive in both methods, whereas cases with higher Ct values were positive in NOP samples only. Some studies have compared the viral load between nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples, showing a tendency for a higher viral load (or lower Cts) in nasopharyngeal swabs [10, 19] . The severity of the cases included and the time elapsed between collection of material and onset of symptoms are essential information to interpret correctly these results, since the sensitivity of the diagnostic methods varies according to these variables.When we compared the chance of identifying the virus in saliva and NOP samples in relation to the time interval between onset of symptoms and sample collection time, it was observed that the identification of the virus in both samples was associated with a shorter interval of time. These results stress the importance of early diagnosis of COVID-19, in which a sample should be collected within the first days of symptoms, thus minimizing the loss of sensitivity of the molecular diagnosis [26] . Different studies have analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 shedding in different biologic specimens, reporting that viral loads from upper respiratory tract samples peak within a week of symptom onset and follow a relatively consistent downward trajectory [27] . The viral load in other biologic specimens, including saliva, follows the same trajectory [28] . However, according to these studies, the viral load does not seem to be as high as that observed in respiratory tract samples. Therefore, our findings are in line with these observations. Chemosensory deficits associated with SARS-CoV -2 infection are quite frequent among patients with mild or moderate disease, considered a very early symptom. Interestingly, in our study ageusia was the only symptom statistically associated with patients SARS-CoV-2 positive only in NOP samples (G3; P = 0.028). These results corroborate with the role of the neurotropic and neuro-invasive characteristics . Relationship between illness course (i.e. time elapsed between symptom onset and sample collection) and cycle threshold values for nasal-oropharyngeal swabs (NOP) (left-hand panels) and saliva samples (right-hand panels). In the NOP samples, the regression coefficients for cycle threshold (delay of log 2 -days) for genes E and S were 0.5 (P = 0.72) and 1.1 (P = 0.42), respectively; the regression coefficients for saliva samples were 0.04 (P = 0.98) and −0.26 (P = 0.87) for genes E and S, respectively. of coronaviruses in the pathogenesis of ageusia, more than a local infection of the gustatory buds [29] . However, the small number of patients in each group is an important limitation to this analysis.Recent studies comparing samples collected by specialized health-workers and self-collected by the patients for COVID-19 molecular diagnosis showed that both methods had similar sensitivity, which highlights the reliability of self-collection as a public health strategy for COVID-19 surveillance [6] [7] [8] . Our results corroborated these findings as they showed that both self-collected samples had good sensitivity, especially the saliva, with 78.6% (95% CI; 67.6% to 86.6%).The present study showed that self-collection of saliva and NOP for diagnosis of COVID-19 is feasible in the studied population. Given the similar sensitivities of saliva and NOP samples for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with mild symptoms, it is expected that selfcollection of either sample can be valuable in the surveillance of COVID-19 at a population level [30] . Moreover, by simplifying the procedure and, above all, avoiding the need for the patient to go to a specialized laboratory, this innovative approach can improve COVID-19 diagnosis, notably allowing the sample to be collected as soon as possible after appearance of the first symptoms. However, in this sense, the ease of collection and feasibility for examination of molecular biomarkers for disease stratification and prognosis justify the use of self-collected saliva as a preferred biological sample [2, 26] .As the main limitation of this study, we could mention the non-inclusion of asymptomatic individuals in the platform of COVID-19 surveillance.In conclusion, our data show the possibility of using at-home self-collected samples (especially saliva), as an adequate alternative for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This new approach of testing can be useful to develop strategies for COVID-19 surveillance and for guiding public health decisions.No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.
