87d0dede836427cb893aca080db6ac91ea0d49c9,The economic impacts of COVID-19 in Brazil based on an interregional CGE approach,"Countries that underestimated the disease and postponed effective enforcement actions to social isolation were faced with a collapse of the health system and uncontrolled expansion of cases.Furthermore, due the potential economic effects of COVID-19 outbreak, many institutions (International Monetary Fund -IMF, 2020; World Trade Organization - WTO, 2020a,b; The World Bank, 2020a,b ; United Nations Conference on Trade and Development -UNCTAD, 2020a,b) and researchers have discussed these effects.These studies have pointed many transmission channels and economic effects. Baldwin and Di Mauro (2020) , for instance, have discussed the potential economic shock regarding the demand and supply side. On the supply side, it is caused by the closures and travel bans that will reduce productivity, causing temporary drops in employment, by health-shock propagation uncertainty and supply-chain shocks. On the demand side, it is caused mainly by the reduction in household consumption.Other studies have focused on the economic effects in many countries around the world. IMF (2020) has projected the economic effects for several economies, including Brazil. UNCTAD (2020a) has focused on the global trade impact of COVID-19 epidemic, while UNCTAD (2020b) has focused on COVID-19 shock in developing countries. McKibbin and Fernando (2020) have simulated seven scenarios regarding the spread of COVID-19 with a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model and a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Considering the scenarios where the pandemic occurs in all countries in different degrees, McKibbin and Fernando (2020) found, for example, a reduction from 1.9% to 8.0% of the Brazilian GDP, depending on which epidemiological scenario is adopted.Global effects of the pandemic were also analyzed by Gössling et al. (2020) and Ramos et al. (2020) using the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). Gössling et al. (2020) assessed the differential regional impacts and implications of the reported impacts of COVID-19 on global tourism until the end of March 2020. They also showed the damage to the tourism economy over 2020 caused by travel restriction and stayat-home policies. These measures have negatively affected the tourism sector, mainly the subsectors of travel, cruises, and accommodation. For example, in the accommodation sector, by March 21, guest numbers have declined by 50% or more, affecting mainly countries with large number of COVID-19 cases, such as Greece and Italy. Ramos et al. (2020) simulated a half drop in the demand of nonessential sector. The authors have divided the WIOD sectors into essential and nonessential sectors and considered a symmetric shock in all countries. Since countries present different economic structure in terms of productive leakages and final demand composition, the authors have identified how they may be affected by consumption pattern changes.The results showed a reduction of 33.1% in world trade. In terms of value added, China and other Asian countries would be the most affected countries. Regarding the trade balance, their results show that developing countries, including Brazil, would have greater drops in imports than exports, improving their trade balance.Regarding the economic impact in Brazil, Haddad et al. (2020a) developed a methodology to assess the daily economic impacts of control strategies for mitigating the effects of COVID-19 outbreak using input-output analysis 5 . They applied the methodology to inform regional and national governments in Brazil on the potential and sectoral economic costs of different strategies of lockdown measures. Haddad et al. (2020b) evaluated the economic impacts of COVID-19 outbreak on tourism concerning the demand reduction in the state of São Paulo by also using an interregional input-output model. Domingues et al. (2020a) used a general equilibrium model to project the economic impacts of an emergency demand for health-related activities, while Domingues et al. (2020b) showed that the economic impacts of COVID-19 caused by the negative employment shock tend to be worse for the poorest households in Brazil. Ribeiro et al. (2020a) and Oliveira et al. (2020) have focused on the potential effects on Brazilian foreign trade.In this context, this study aims to simulate the impacts of COVID-19 outbreak on the Brazilian economy using a dynamic interregional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The simulations consider three transmission channels through the economy related to the outbreak and its effects. The first channel considers a negative labor supply shock calculated from estimations of morbidity (number of people infected by the virus and temporarily unable to work) and mortality (number of people who die due to infection disease). The dimension of this shock has been based on information from the epidemiological scenarios of COVID-19 outbreak projected by the Imperial College London COVID-19 Response Team (Walker, Whittaker, Watson et al., 2020) .The second channel considers a temporary shutdown or reduction of nonessential economic activities, mainly services, due to social isolation. Finally, the third channel incorporates the effects of fiscal stimulus announced by the Brazilian Government to mitigate the contractionary economic effects of the disease.The projections are divided into two scenarios: Scenario 1 considers the first two transmission channels related to the COVID-19 outbreak and the social isolation; and Scenario 2 adds the government's countercyclical fiscal policies to the first one. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out by considering the duration of the nonessential economic activity's shutdown. Uncertainty about the evolution of Covid-19 made it difficult to anticipate how long social isolation measures should remain, raising the importance of this sensitivity analysis. Therefore, we simulate a shutdown of 3 and 6 months in both scenarios.It is worth mentioning that this study does not intend to be exhaustive in terms of incorporating the derailment of wide range of government policies that can potentially contribute to counteract the contractionary economic effects. Many fiscal measures are still in the process of formulation, approval, and regulation by the competent authorities. Furthermore, economic results are sensitive to the choice of the epidemiological scenario and, depending on the evolution of the number of infected, the mortality rate and the practices of social isolation, they may be more intense or not.Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is to estimate the economic impact of COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil with regional and sectoral detailing, obtained from a scientific modeling framework that integrates information from the economic system and epidemiological scenarios. The results obtained can be used to subsidize policymakers and other agents to deal with the consequences of the disease.This study is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief presentation of the economic modeling framework used to project the economic impacts for Brazil.Section 3 presents details about each scenario. Section 4 reports and discusses the main results. Finally, section 5 presents the final considerations.In order to simulate the impacts of COVID-19 outbreak on the Brazilian economy, we used a dynamic and interregional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, which is named TERM-UF. This model is fully disaggregated by 27 Brazilian States and 29 economic sectors, as detailed in Chart 1. Its theoretical structure and solution mechanisms follow the Australian TERM model (Horridge, 2012; Wittwer, 2017). 6 The database was constructed using the regionalization procedure developed by Horridge (2006) . The first step consisted in calibrating the static version of a national CGE model based on the input-output database for Brazil in 2015. The second step uses a large set of secondary data 7 , which allows for the identification of the regional structure of production and consumption at the regional level. Finally, the interregional trade flows are estimated by applying a gravitational approach.CGE models are a useful tool to simulate economic scenarios, since they incorporate a detailed set of behavioral economic equations, forming a system that recognizes the interdependence of transactional relationships between different economic agents: firms, families, government, and the external sector. In the TERM-UF model, all these relationships are established at the regional level, i.e., the Brazilian States, and aggregated for the entire economy allowing for the generation of results at the national and regional levels. For the detailed theoretical structure and more information on TERM see: www.copsmodels.com/term. 7 The data includes regional output shares, regional investment shares and regional household consumption shares by sector and region from IBGE (the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), RAIS (Annual List of Social Information) and POF (Household Budget Survey). Furthermore, it includes regional government expenditure shares, regional export shares and regional import shares by commodities and region from IBGE, SECEX and RAIS. Finally, the data also considers the regional population from IBGE. The simulations with the TERM-UF model involve the specification of a baseline (reference scenario) and policy scenarios. The baseline represents a reference path at a national level, given the expected behavior of economic variables reflected mainly on macroeconomic aggregates (GDP and investment), which follows the trend of the recent period. In this study, the base scenario assumes, for example, that national GDP would grow by 2.2% in 2020, as expected by the Central Bank's Focus report before the proliferation of COVID-19 in Brazil 9 . The regional economic results are calculated endogenously and guarantee the consistence with the baseline at the national economy level. In its turn, the policy scenario represents an exogenous ""disruption"" in the economic system that affects the decision of economic agents, scenarios presented in this paper, all changes related to isolation and the shutdown trigger adverse deviations on the main economic variables, as illustrated in Figure 1 .Source: Elaborated by the authors.For the two policy scenarios simulated, we used a combination of information about the epidemiological scenario, sectoral isolation effects and fiscal policy measures. For both scenarios, all exogenous variations were imposed at the national level. Therefore, all regional differences are calculated endogenously. For Scenario 1, we incorporated a supply shock in the workforce resulting from the expected morbidity and mortality rates due to COVID-19, as well as a fall in activity in specific economic sectors due to social isolation. For Scenario 2, we kept the shocks assessed in Scenario 1 in addition to governmental fiscal measures planned so far by the Federal Government.Furthermore, in both scenarios, a sensitive analysis related to the temporary shutdown is considered. We simulated Scenarios 1 and 2 with 3 and 6 months of shutdown.The first transmission channel in Scenario 1 assumes that the effects of COVID-19's morbidity and mortality should cause a shock to the labor supply in the national economy due to the time necessary for the treatment and recovery of infected people as well as those who will die of the disease. The dimensioning of this shock was based on the epidemiological estimates for COVID-19 in Brazil elaborated by the study of the Imperial College London COVID-19 Response Team (Walker, Whittaker, Watson et al., 2020) 10 . Due to the measures of social isolation taken in Brazil and considering that the official estimates may underestimate the number of infected people in the country, we decided to use the parameters of the suppression scenarios of the Imperial College London as a reference for calibrating the labor supply shock.The calibration of the supply shock considers a scenario of suppression with three main characteristics. First, the basic reproduction number (average number of secondary infections due to a typical infection in an unrestricted epidemic and a fully susceptible population) is 3. Secondly, the scenario considers an isolation rate of 75%.And third, about 23% of the population are infected. Assuming a labor force participation rate of 45% 11 , and considering infections as temporary losses (two weeks in a year) and deaths as permanent losses, the labor supply shock was dimensioned at -1.04%.The second transmission channel in Scenario 1 refers to the effects of the economic activity reduction associated with social isolation. The isolation of the population was considered to potentially paralyze several activities in the economy for 3 months (a) or 6 months (b), especially those that generate overcrowding. Although some activities continue via home office, the hypothesis is that during these months, activities such as Trade, Transport, Accommodation, Food services (restaurants), Other administrative activities, Artistic activities, Associative Organizations and Others will be totally or partially paralyzed. For the subsectors attracting crowds (shopping malls, artistic and cultural activities, among others), a reduction of 100% in the economic activity was assumed, while for the subsectors where social distancing can be maintained, a decrease of 50% was assumed. The shocks where calibrated according 10 The research by the Imperial College London COVID-19 Response Team (2020) estimated five different scenarios. Scenario (1) considers that no mitigation measures are carried out in the country. Scenario (2) includes mitigation measures and horizontal social distance ranging between 35% and 45% of the population. Scenario (3) incorporates to Scenario (2) the intensification of the social distance of the elderly population in order to reduce their social contact rate by 60%. And Scenario (4) is characterized as one of suppression associating the social isolation of 75% of the population to different epidemiological triggers according to the mortality rates per 100,000 inhabitants. Estimates in all scenarios are also conditioned by different factors of epidemiological reproduction (R0 ranging from 2.4 to 3.3). 11 We used the observed rate for 2019.to the dimensioning of the workforce in each sector from the Continuous National Household Survey (PNADC) 12 microdata (IBGE, 2020).We considered a shutdown of 3 and 6 months in the year of 2020 for all states. These simulations allow us to highlight the most fragile regions. In other words, we can identify regions that could suffer more negatively the impacts due to the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 outbreak.Nonetheless, it is important to highlight as a limitation of the study that our results do not consider the fact that social distancing and stoppage of productive activities were not homogeneous across the states, and the outbreak was also unevenly spread.Policies of social distance were determined by local authorities, and initially, regions of the Southeast, Northeast and North were the most affected by the virus. By July 2020, those regions reached a stable or declining number of cases, however the number of confirmed cases increased in the South and Midwest regions.Scenario 2 involves the same shocks specified for Scenario 1 plus the shocks considering the increase in government and household consumption associated with the fiscal stimulus measures formulated by the Federal and State Governments. In this way, the scenario allows us to enquire in what extent the fiscal package contributes to the alleviation of the contractionary economic effects of COVID-19 in Brazil. It is worth noting that this simulation was carried out in a short-run context since it was assumed that the expansion of public expenditure will be financed by public deficits. We briefly discuss the long-run potential implications in the final remarks section.The calibration of these shocks was based on the impacts of the various governmental measures on the primary result of the government in 2020, according to the report of the Fiscal Policy Observatory from IBRE-FGV 13 . Besides a wide-ranging set of governmental measures, for simulation purposes, those measures which would imply increases were considered in the public expenditure, such as new expenses created and exceptional finance aid to state and municipal governments. The stimulus 12 In Portuguese: ""Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios Contínua"". 13 See: https://observatorio-politica-fiscal.ibre.fgv.br. Accessed: May 26, 2020. measures were estimated to represent an impact on the public consumption of R$ 260.2 billion, corresponding to approximately 3.5% of the GDP. In scenario 2, this impact was assumed to correspond to an exogenous increase in government expenditure.For simulation purposes, the emergency assistance to low-income people was also considered to represent a direct effect on household consumption. Considering the number of households potentially benefited by this measure based on information from the PNADC microdata and calculating the impact on household income, a potential impact on household consumption was estimated to be of 2.23%. It is worth mentioning that the amount associated with this measure was not incorporated into the government's consumption shock to avoid double counting. Figure 2 presents the GDP growth forecast (%) in Scenarios 1 and 2 compared to the Central Bank's projection for 2020 before COVID-19 outbreak. Considering the 3 months of shutdown, the Brazilian GDP in 2020 would reduce 3.78% in Scenario 1a.Adding the Government fiscal stimulus, Scenario 2a, the reduction would be smaller, 0.48%. Further, considering the uncertainties about the outbreak and need for social isolation, the figure also shows the projection with 6 moths of shutdown in nonessential economic activities -Scenarios 1b and 2b. In this case, the Brazilian GDP would reduce 10.90% in Scenario 1b and 7.64% in Scenario 2b.These results show how the economic effects are sensitive to the shutdown duration. Furthermore, they also show that fiscal stimulus considered in Scenario 2 are not able to mitigate all negative effects caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, even in the most optimistic scenario in which the shutdown remains for only three months. The negative effect is clearer when the Central Bank Projection is used as benchmark. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, the Brazilian Central Bank has projected a GDP increase of 2.20% in 2020.Source: Elaborated by the authors based on the model's results. Note: Scenarios 1a and 2a consider 3 months of shutdown while Scenarios 1b and 2b consider 6 months of shutdown. Table 1 presents the macroeconomic results as percentage (%) deviation in relation to the reference scenario (baseline). As shown, the GDP would present a deviation of -5.85% in Scenario 1 with 3 months of shutdown in relation to the reference scenario.This reduction is calculated based on the difference between baseline, with GDP growth of 2.2% and the policy scenario, with a variation of -3.78% in GDP 14 . The deviation would be -2.63% with the fiscal stimulus -Scenario 2. Considering the longer shutdown, 6 months, the GDP deviations in Scenario 1 and 2 would be -12.82% and -9.63%, respectively.The table also shows the estimated deviation in household consumption. It would represent a negative deviation of 10.77% and 8.54% in Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively, with 3 months of shutdown. If the period of 6 months is considered, the effect would be a negative deviation of -23.11 and -20.88. The smaller reduction in household consumption in Scenario 2 is due to the income transfer policy that were considered in this scenario and partially mitigates the pandemic effects. The sectoral activity results can be seen in Figures 3 and 4 . Figure 3 presents the results of Scenario 1 with 3 and 6 months of shutdown of nonessential activities, while Furthermore, it is important to highlight the results of the private health sector.Although an increase in the health expenditure is expected during the pandemic, our simulations show a negative effect on the sector. This result is explained by the fact that our scenarios do not consider this private health expenditure exogenously since there is a lack of data on this. Thus, we assess the direct and indirect effects (via the production chain) of the stoppage of nonessential activity, including these effects in the private health sector. If available, these estimates may be included in future studies.Source: Elaborated by the authors based on the model's results. This article is protected by copyright.

In both scenarios, the smallest deviations are observed for regions with less participation of services considered nonessential, and with greater participation mainly in agriculture, livestock and the entire industrial complex for the production and distribution of food and beverages. In Scenario 2, the fiscal policies mitigate the effects of COVID-19 outbreak on the economy, but they are not enough to reverse the negative results for most of the regions. In general, in Scenario 2, the economies that have a larger share of the government in GDP have presented better results than the others. This study has projected the economic impacts of COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil. Due the environment of uncertainties regarding the epidemiological progress of the disease and its economic consequences, it contributes to society by providing detailed information at national and regional levels that can be useful to subsidize actions to deal with the economic consequences of the disease.The projections were simulated through a dynamic interregional computable general equilibrium model. Two scenarios were simulated. Scenario 1 accesses two economic transmission channels of COVID-19 outbreak: (i) a reduction in labor supply due to the effects of morbidity and mortality; and (ii) a reduction in activity levels of specific sectors that are affected by the need of social isolation to combat the spread of the disease. Scenario 2 assesses the effects of the Government fiscal stimulus to counteract the contractionary effects of the disease. Furthermore, in both scenarios, a sensitive analysis related to the shutdown duration is considered. We simulated Scenarios 1 and 2 allowing for 3 and 6 months of shutdown. This sensitive analysis is important since the measures of social distancing and stoppage of activities in the Brazilian states have not been adopted homogeneously. These simulations have allowed us to highlight the most fragile regions.Considering 3 months of shutdown due to social isolation, Scenario 1 projects a reduction of 3.78% in the national GDP growth rate for 2020. If fiscal stimulus is accounted for, the negative effect is partially mitigated, with a reduction projection of 0.48% in the national GDP for 2020. Considering a longer shutdown period, greater losses are expected in both scenariosa decrease of 10.90% in the GDP growth rate in Scenario 1 and of 7.64% in Scenario 2. Regarding the regional results, projections indicate reductions in the GDP for most of the Brazilian States in both scenarios. Some economies are more vulnerable in relation to the partial closure of nonessential activities, such as Rondônia, Acre and Goiás. Therefore, the role of government measures to combat the economic crisis becomes even more important for these economies. In addition, the study did not consider the negative impacts resulting from a reduction in international trade, which can cause even greater effects, notably in the most exporting regions (such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and RioGrande do Sul).It is noteworthy that the projections of this study are conditioned to the hypotheses considered about the perspectives of epidemiological evolution of the disease and the shutdown duration. Therefore, variations in these parameters may affect the projected results. In particular, the epidemiological scenario assumes the adoption of social isolation, which may not be confirmed at the required level. If the isolation is not met, the number of infected people may increase significantly, also increasing the loss in the supply of work due to morbidity and mortality, and, consequently, worsening the economic resultsRegarding the countercyclical effects associated with the fiscal stimulus, two limitations should be raised and could be addressed in future research. First, the income effects from transfers were measured considering the consumption pattern of a single representative household, hence we did not capture the heterogeneity across households. Additionally, COVID-19 has increased unemployment and reduced income, affecting mainly informal and low-income jobs. Both of those aspects raise income inequality issues, which could be better addressed in a model with household consumption and wages divided by income groups.Second, our simulations did not evaluate aspects related to how the expansion of government expenditure could be financed in the long term. In spite of the emergence of using fiscal policy to mitigate the recessive effects caused by Covid-19 in the short run, the long-term economic dynamic could be negatively affected due the potential expansion of public debt and its consequences on the future tax burden. This concern stems from the high public spending required to combat the pandemic, including transitory expenses for public health and policies to mitigate the economic and social effects. Furthermore, the public revenues had also dropped abruptly. In Brazil, this is politically sensitive since the country was in a process to adjust public accounts.Recently, a constitutional amendment was approved (spending cap and social security reform) and others were under discussion. However, in the new context, part of the transitory expenses, including those for social assistance, are expected to continue for some time. Thus, future research needs to advance for achieving a better comprehension about the intertemporal economic effects of the disease, which may include aspects related to fiscal sustainability.

f63686fa54043be7f951e34bb56b8a0c1b157e1b,COVID 19 AND A WAVELET ANALYSIS OF THE TOTAL DEATHS PER MONTH IN BRAZIL SINCE 2015 A PREPRINT,"The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the Continuous and Discrete Wavelet Transforms for the reader who is not familiar with the subject. If the reader is familiar with the theory of wavelets, he or she may proceed to Section 3, which presents the experimental results. Finally, section 4 presents our conclusions and and highlights some topics for further work.The Fourier Transform (FT) of a signal x(t), t ∈ R (t denotes time), if exists, is defined as (1) in which ν denotes the frequency in cycles/second [Hz] .Gabor [12] has shown that it is possible to represent the local spectral content of a signal x(t) around an instant of time τ by the Windowed Fourier Transform (WFT).in which g T (t) is a window of finite duration support T and ν denotes frequency.The WFT is a two-dimensional representation defined on the time-frequency domain (or plane) as it depends on the ν and τ parameters. The WFT would be equivalent to a kind of continuous ""sheet music"" description of x(t).According to the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle [13, p.52 ], a signal whose energy content is quite well localized in time has this energy quite spread out in the frequency domain. As the window of (2) has a fixed size T , we may conclude that the WFT is not good to analyze (or identify) behaviors of x(t) occurring in time intervals much smaller or much larger than T , as, for example, transient phenomena of duration ∆t << T or cycles that exist in periods larger than T .A wavelet ψ 0 (t) (sometimes also called mother wavelet), t ∈ R, is a function that satisfies three conditions [4] , [14] .1. Its Fourier transform Ψ(ν), −∞ < ν < ∞, is such that exists a finite constant C ψ that obeys the admissibility condition2. The integral of ψ 0 (t) is null:3. Its energy is unitary: Figure 1 shows four examples of wavelet functions: Haar, Daubechies, Coiflet and Symmlet. As the name suggests, a wavelet is a 'small wave'. A small wave grows and decays in a limited time period. On the other hand, an example of a 'big wave' is the cosine function cos t, which is 'eternal', i. e., keeps oscilating up and down for all t.The wavelet transform is a relatively new tool for the analysis of signals, given that his mathematical theory was formalized in the 1980s [15] . The wavelet transform has been originally developed as an analysis and synthesis tool of continuous time energy signals [16] , [17] , [18] , [19] , [15] , [20] .An energy signal x(t), obeys the constrainti. e., x(t) that obeys the constraint (6) belongs to the squared summable functions space L 2 (R). Presently, the wavelet transform has also been used as an analysis tool of discrete time signals.There are continuous time and discrete time wavelet decompositions designate by Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).The CWT of a signal x(t) consists of a set C = {W ψ (s, τ ), s ∈ R + , τ ∈ R}, in which• τ is the time localization parameter,• s represents scale, and• ψ denotes a wavelet function, of wavelet coefficients on the continuous time-scale plane (also known as time-frequency plane) given bydenotes a dilated and shifted version of the ""mother"" wavelet ψ 0 (t).The factor 1/ √ s in (7) provides all functions of the classhave the same energy (norm).The basic idea of the CWT defined by (7) is to correlate 1 a signal x(t) with shifted (by τ ) and dilated (by s) versions of a mother wavelet (that has a pass-band spectrum). The CWT is a two parameters function. So, it is a redundant transform, because it consists on mapping an one-dimension signal on the time-scale plane.Differently from the WFT, where the reconstruction is made from the same family of functions as that used in the analysis, in the CWT the synthesis is made with functionsψ s,τ that have to satisfỹSo, x(t) is completely recovered by the Inverse Continuous Wavelet Transform (ICWT):The fundamental difference between the CWT and the WFT consists of the fact that the functions ψ s,τ undergo dilations and compressions [13] . The analysis on refined scales of time (small values of s) requires ""fast"" ψ s,τ functions, i. e., of a small support, while the analysis on aggregate scales of time (large values of s) requires ""slower"" ψ s,τ functions, i. e., of a wider support. As already mentioned, the internal product defined by (7) is a measure of similarity between the wavelet ψ t−τ s and the signal x(t) on a certain instant of time τ and on a determined scale s. For a fixed τ , large values of s correspond to a low-frequency analysis, while small values of s are associated to a high-frequency analysis. Therefore, the wavelet transform has a variable time resolution (i. e., the capacity of analyzing a signal from close -""zoom in"" -or from far -""zoom out""), being adequate to analyze phenomena that occur in different time scales. Note that the discontinuity produces large coefficients in its respective cone of influence, which converge to the location of the singularity.There are two kinds of DWT:• the DWT for discrete time signals; and • the DWT for continuous time signals.The DWT may be formulated for discrete time signals (as it is done, for example, by Percival and Walden [4] ) without establishing any explicit connection with the CWT. On the other hand, we should not understand the term ""discrete"" of the DWT for continuous time signals as meaning that this transform is defined over a discrete time signal. But only that the coefficients produced by this transform belong to a subset D = {w j,k = W ψ (2 j , 2 j k), j ∈ Z, k ∈ Z} of the set C [14, p.105], [21] .In fact, the DWT coefficients for continuous time signals can also be directly obtained by means of the integralin which the indices j and k are called scale and localization, respectively, does not involve any discrete time signal, but the continuous time signal x(t).Equation (11) shows that the continuous time DWT corresponds to a critically sampled version of the CWT defined by (7) in the dyadic scales s = 2 j , j = . . . , −1, 0, 1, 2, . . ., in which the instants of time in the dyadic scale s = 2 j are separated by multiples of 2 j . The function ψ 0 of (11) must be defined from a Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) of the signal x(t) [4] , [20] , [22] . Observe that the continuous time MRA theory is similar to that of discrete time.In this paper, we decided, for mere convenience, to present the continuous time MRA version based on the spectral analysis of a ""fictitious"" signal {x t , t ∈ R} that is associated to the discrete time series {x n , n ∈ Z} [21] . The subspace V j is known as the approximation space associated to the time scale s j = 2 j (assuming that V 0 is the approximation space with unit scale).If the x(t) projection on V j is represented by the scale coefficientsthen properties 1 and 3 assure that limProperty 4 implies that the subspace V j is a scaled version of subspace V 0 (multiresolution).The orthonormal basis mentioned in property 5 is obtained by time shifts of the low-pass function φ j .Consider the successive approximations sequence (also known in the literature as wavelet smooths [4] ) of x(t)This fact illustrates the MRA's fundamental idea, that consists in examining the loss of information when one goes from S j (t) to S j+1 (t):∆x j+1 (t) (called detail of x j (t)) belongs to the subspace W j+1 , named detail space [4] that is associated to the fluctuations (or variations) of the signal in the more refined time scale s j = 2 j and that corresponds to the orthogonalThe MRA shows that the detail signals ∆x j+1 (t) = D j+1 (t) may be directly obtained by successive projections of the original signal x(t) over wavelet subspaces W j .Besides, the MRA theory shows that exists a function ψ 0 (t), called ""mother wavelet"" , that is obtainedThe internal product ψ j+1,k (t), x(t) = w j+1,k denotes the wavelet coefficient associated to scale j + 1 and discrete time k and {ψ j+1,k (t)} is a family of wavelet functions that generates the subspace W j+1 , orthogonal to subspace V j+1 (W j+1 ⊥V j+1 ), i. e., ψ j+1,n , φ j+1,p = 0 , ∀n, p.Therefore, the detail signal D j+1 (t) belongs to the complementary subspace W j+1 of V j , becauseThat is, V j is given by the direct addition of V j+1 and W j+1 , and this means that any element in V j may be determined from the addition of two orthogonal elements belonging to V j+1 and W j+1 . Iterating (17), we haveEq. (18) says that the approximation S j (t) is given byThe MRA of a continuous time signal x(t) is initiated by determining the coefficients 3 u 0 (k) = φ 0,k (t), x(t) , in which k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1, that are associated to the projection of x(t) on the approximation subspace V 0 .Following, the sequence {u 0 (k)} is decomposed by filtering and sub-sampling by a factor of 2 (downsampling) in two sequences: {u 1 (k)} and {w 1 (k)}, each one with N/2 points. This filtering and sub-sampling process is repeated several times, producing the sequences2 Besides, Wj+1 is contained in the subspace Vj. 3 The sequence u0(k) is obtained sampling the filter's output whose impulse response is φ * (−t) (matched filter with a function φ0(t) = φ(t)) at instants k = 0, 1, 2, . . ., i. e., u0(k) = x(t) φ * (−t) for k = 0, 1, 2, . . ., in which denotes convolution. andThe literature calls the set of coefficients [21] , [23] as the DWT of the x(t) signal. The reconstruction of x(t) is implemented by filtering and oversampling by a factor of 2 (upsampling) of the sequences (20) and (21), obtaining an approximation of x(t) in the subspace V 0orEq. (24) defines the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT).We say that the function φ 0 (t) = φ(t) determines a MRA of x(t) according to (23) , if it obeys the following conditions:1. intra-scale orthonormality (property 5)in which δ m,n is the Kronecker's delta (δ m,n = 1 if m = n, δ m,n = 0 for m = n). Eq. (25) imposes an orthonormality condition at scale j = 0.as several φ(t − k) fit in φ( t 2 ) (is a consequence of property (1) of the MRA).Equation 27 may be rewritten asknown as Dilation Equation, n ∈ Z.Equations 27 and 28 may be written, respectively, in the frequency domain asandin which Φ(ν) is the FT of φ(t) and G(ν) = n g n e −j2πνn , known as scale filter (low-pass), represents a periodic filter in ν.As the subspace W j+1 is orthogonal to V j+1 and is in V j , we haveorthat is the Wavelet Equation.Applying the FT to (31) and (32) we get, respectively,andin which H(ν) is the wavelet filter (high-pass).Rewriting (16) in terms of the frequency domain and using (29) and (33) results the orthogonality conditionthat the filter H has to obey so the family {ψ 1,k (t)} is orthogonal to the family {φ 1,k (t)}.We may show that the condition [ in which L denotes the length of a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter g n , H(z) and G(z) denote the z-transform of sequences h n and g n , respectively, is sufficient to (35) to hold.We say that g n e h n are Quadrature Mirrored Filters (QMF) when they are related by (36). Figure 6 shows the QMF filters frequency response related to a Daubechies wavelet of order 10 (db10). According to (28), the MRA departs from a definition (from several possible) of the scale function φ(t), that is related to the scale filter g n by (27). Eq. (36) says that the choice of a FIR-type filter {g n } implies a {h n } that is also FIR. At last, the wavelet function is determined by (31).The scale φ(t) and wavelet ψ(t) functions associated to the FIR filters {g n } and {h n } have compact support, thus offering the time resolution functionality. The simplest scale function that satisfies (25) is the characteristic function of the interval I = [0, 1), that corresponds to the Haar's scale function:In this case (Haar MRA), the associated Haar scale filter is given by We can demonstrate that [17] :and thatAccording to (42) and (43), we can obtain the coefficients u j (n) and w j (n) from the scale coefficients u j−1 (m) by means of decimation operation of the sequence {u j−1 (m)} by a factor of 2. The decimation consists in cascading a low-pass filter g(−m) (with a transfer functionḠ(z) = G(1/z) and frequency response G * (f )) or a high-pass h(−m) (with transfer functionH(z) = H(1/z) and frequency response H * (f )) with a compressor (or decimator) by a factor of 2. Decimate a signal by a factor D is the same as to reduce its sampling rate by D times.The MRA is implemented by a low-pass and high-pass analysis filter banks G * (f ) and H * (f ) adequately positioned for separating the scale and wavelet coefficients sequences. This is known in the literature as the pyramid algorithm presented by Mallat [17] . Later, it is possible to rebuild the original signal using dual QMF reconstruction filter banks, low-pass G(f ) and high-pass H(f ).It is important to emphasize that the pyramid algorithm's complexity is O(N ) (assuming we want to evaluate the DWT of N samples), while the direct evaluation of the DWT (that involves matrices multiplication) is O(N 2 ) [4] . Figure 8 shows the QMF analysis filter banks G * (f ) (low-pass) and H * (f ) (high-pass) with decimation (downsampling) by a factor of 2. Figure 9 shows the QMF reconstruction filter banks with interpolation (upsampling) by a factor of 2.Observe that are used dual low-pass and high-pass filters, G(f ) and H(f ). Figure 10 presents the flow diagram that shows the initial projection of a signal x(t) on V 0 followed by the decomposition in W 1 , W 2 and V 2 . Figure 10 : Flow diagram that shows the initial projection of a signal x(t) on V 0 followed by the decomposition in W 1 , W 2 and V 2 . Figure 11 shows the flow diagram that illustrates the approximate synthesis of x(t) from W 1 , W 2 and V 2 . Figure 12 presents a block diagram that shows that the DWT works as a sub-bands codification scheme. The spectrum U 0 (f ) of the signal u 0 (n) is subdivided in three frequency bands (that cover two octaves): 0 ≤ f < 1/8, 1/8 ≤ f < 1/4 and 1/4 ≤ f ≤ 1/2. Figure 11 : Flow diagram that illustrates the approximate synthesis of x(t) from W 1 , W 2 and V 2 . Figure 12 : The spectrum U 0 (f ) of the signal u 0 (n) is subdivided in three frequency bands (that cover two octaves):In section 2, we described how the DWT can be applied to a signal x(t). However, the purpose of this study requires that we think of x(t) as a realization of a stochastic process {x(t)}, so that we can be able to realize a statistical assessment of the change point. The reader interested in the definition of a stochastic process can consult the reference [24] for more information. Figure 13 shows the historical series in Brazil from January 2015 to July 2020 (67 samples). Figure 13 : Historical series in Brazil from January 2015 to July 2020.In the paper [24] , we showed that the signal of Fig. 13 obeys a model of the type [25] [p. 58]where x(t) are the observations, y(t) is a stationary process, and µ(t) denotes a linear trend given by the regression modelin which β 0 and β 1 are the intercept and the slope parameters. We also estimated an autoregressive model of order 11 (AR(11)) for y(t). An AR (11) is said to exhibit short-range dependence, as the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the signal does not have 1/f behavior for frequencies near to zero (Long Range Dependence (LRD)).In [24] , we conclude that there are no change points in the slope of the historical series and in the mean of the series that corresponds to the first difference of the historical series. Table 1 shows the estimated coeffcientes for (45) and its p-values. Figure 14 shows the historical series with the superimposed linear regression model. As in [24] , the first step in wavelet analysis requires that the deterministic trend of the historical series be removed, in order to perform the time-frequency domain analysis [25] [p. 58]. There are two alternatives: remove the line estimated by the regression or take the first difference in the series. As our goal is to coerce the data to (a possible) stationarity, then differencing may be more appropriate [25] [p. 61]. The first two samples of the historical series were discarded so that the series corresponding to the first difference has 64 points, that is, 2 6 points, which is appropriate for a wavelet analysis with the DWT.The first difference can be denote as Figure 15 shows the series r(t) (we also demeaned it). Now, as far as a qualitative analysis is concerned, we have to focus our wavelet (graphical) analysis on the most refined scales of the time-frequency doman, where possible changes in variance can be localized. This is the intuition behind where we assume that r(t) has N j nonboundary wavelet coefficients w j (L j ), w j (L j + 1), . . . , w j (N j − 1), in which Here is a noteworthy example of an important advantage of wavelet analysis over Fourier. Should the same signal had been analyzed by the FT, we would not have been able to detect the instant of the change point, whereas it is clearly observable here. Now, let us compare the plot of the raw data along with the level-one wavelet detail signal (D1) in Fig. 18 (LA(8) MRA), which indicates the existence of a change in variance around t = 22 (2017/jan), see the red arrow. Remember that the detail signal D1 is located in the frequency band 1 4 , 1 2 . Fig. 19 illustrates the Haar MRA. Note that we can also see change in variance around t = 22 (2017/jan) in the level-one wavelet detail signal. Now we can confirme our qualitative analysis using the function wvarchg() (MATLAB© R2015a Wavelet Toolbox), which calculates the optimal positioning and (potentially) number of changepoints. As the signal r(t) is SRD, there is no need to be concerned with the question of sampling of the variance of the wavelet coefficients, which is problematic for long memory process [4, p. 380 ].The test confirms that there is a change point in variance in t = 22.In this paper, we presented an overview of the Continuos and Discrete Wavelet Transforms, and a wavelet analysis of the historical series of the total number of deaths per month in Brazil since 2015. Our preliminary results indicate that:• the variance of the signal changed in january of 2017; however, this change point occurred before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic; and • there is no evidence that COVID-19 provoked a change in the stochastic process that generates the historical series, as there are no change points in this signal after the outbreak of COVID-19 in Brazil, which happened in the beginning of march, 2020.There is no doubt that COVID-19 has caused the deaths of many people around the world. Many who survived will have to live with sequelae in the brain, kidneys, lungs and heart. In addition, the world population is being subjected to a high degree of stress, due to fear of the new coronavirus, economic/financial problems, etc.However, our results suggest that COVID-19 did not cause any change point in the brazilian series of the total number of deaths per month in Brazil since 2015 so far. What would be a plausible explanation for this strange result? Answering this question requires a multidisciplinary approach, as it involves several areas of knowledge such as medicine, signal processing, statistics etc.Nevertheless, researchers in the area must continue to monitor the behavior of the historical series in Brazil.In future work, we suggest the application of the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) and the Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (DWPT) [4] to the brazilian historical series. We would also like to analyze the series from other countries affected by COVID-19.",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-01,9
9c9681cd809d1ef53969caa37e79b06222ced5b4,"COVID-19 pandemic: environmental and social factors influencing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in São Paulo, Brazil","The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 14 million people worldwide so far (Worldometers 2020) , the reason why the World Health Organization (WHO) has described the situation as a pandemic (WHO 2020).Up to date (July 17, 2020) , there are 2,046,328 confirmed cases in all regions of Brazil (Brazil 2020) , which is currently the second leading country in number of cases (Worldometers 2020) . São Paulo state accounts for 20% of cumulative confirmed cases in Brazil, with 407,415 confirmed cases, being currently the most affected state worldwide (John Hopkins 2020), while São Paulo-SP is the city with most confirmed cases (163, 624) in Brazil (SEADE 2020a) . São Paulo is the largest city in Latin America, with a population of 12,252,023 people, and an expanded metropolitan area with 33,652,991 people (SEADE 2020b). On March 24, 2020, partial lockdown was ordered by São Paulo state government (São Paulo 2020a), being social isolation monitored since then (São Paulo 2020b).One recent review has addressed the role of climate change in the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases worldwide, indicating that temperature is an important environmental condition determining the success of infectious agents (El-Sayed and Kamel 2020) . Furthermore, several studies have investigated the impact of weather on the COVID-19 transmission, with special attention to temperature and humidity (Harmooshi et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Qi et al. Responsible editor: Lotfi Aleya * Liane Yuri Kondo Nakada lnakada@unicamp.br 2020; Şahin 2020), indicating that temperature is inversely related to COVID-19 incidence. Moreover, each 1°C increase in temperature has been associated with decreases in daily new cases at different extents (Prata et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020) . A few investigations have also considered social aspects potentially associated with the spread of COVID-19, such as population density, metropolitan population, intra-provincial traffic, and national lockdown, indicating that the social distancing measures have been successful in reducing new cases (Ahmadi et al. 2020; Hamidi et al. 2020; Tobías 2020) .The aim of this study was to assess environmental and social factors influencing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the expanded metropolitan area of São Paulo, Brazil.Seeking to understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the most affected area of Brazil, COVID-19 infection rate from March 24, 2020, to July 06, 2020, were analyzed. The infection rate (Eq. 1) defined by Ahmadi et al. (2020) was used to assess the COVID-19 spread speed.Firstly, a spatial analysis was conducted using the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 to provide insights into the spread of COVID-19 within the expanded metropolitan area over time. Moreover, cities in the expanded metropolitan area of São Paulo with more than 500 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were selected for statistical analyses (Spearman correlation test and sensitivity analysis) of the following social indicators which possibly influence the incidence of COVID-19 (infection rates): population (people), population density (people•km −2 ), Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI), gross domestic product (R$ per capita), and average income (R$ per capita). Therefore, 59 cities were included in this analysis, accounting for a total of 29,389,922 people.Secondly, the following criteria were used for selecting cities for statistical analyses (Spearman correlation test and sensitivity analysis) of both meteorological conditions and social isolation rate: (i) cities with more than 2000 confirmed cases of COVID-19; (ii) within the expanded metropolitan area of São Paulo; and (iii) with available meteorological data. Thus, a total of 10 cities were analyzed considering the infection rates, corresponding to a population of 18,033,600 people (Table 1) .Daily data made available by the São Paulo State Environmental Agency (CETESB 2020) were used to assess the meteorological conditions of temperature (T,°C), relative humidity (RH, %), wind speed (WS, m s −1 ), and ultraviolet radiation (UV, W m −2 ) from March 18, 2020, to July 06, 2020. Social isolation rates (SIR, %) published on a daily basis by the São Paulo State Social Isolation Intelligent Monitoring System (São Paulo 2020b) were used to analyze the effectiveness of a social distancing measure for reducing the transmission of COVID-19. For each city, the Spearman correlation test at 95% significance level (α = 0.05) was used to assess correlation between infection rate and meteorological parameters or social isolation rate.The partial correlation coefficient (PCC) method was applied to perform a sensitivity analysis using the infection rate as the dependent variable and meteorological conditions or social indicators as the independent variables. Data were normalized using the mean value and the standard deviation (Eq. 2), according to Zhu et al. (2020) . The forward, stepwise, and backward procedures (Mollalo et al. 2020) were conducted to select the best linear regression model and to determine the regression coefficients and significant variables (p value < 0.15). where X is the normalized value; x is the raw value; μ is the mean value; and σ is the standard deviation.The analysis of cumulative confirmed cases in a spatialdependent manner shows that initially (March 26, 2020), the COVID-19 transmission was mainly in the capital city São Paulo. Over the weeks, increasing transmission has been occurring in cities surrounded by highways, and by July 06, 2020, COVID-19 has spread all over the expanded metropolitan area of São Paulo (Fig. 1) . Therefore, using spatial analysis, we have observed that the spread of COVID-19 from the capital city São Paulo-its epicenter in Brazil-is directly associated with the availability of highways within the expanded metropolitan area of São Paulo. Our findings are consistent with recent literature, as Hamidi et al. (2020) have reported metropolitan population as one of the most significant predictors of infection rates in the USA, due to shared transportation and interaction of people in metropolitan areas.Using the Spearman correlation test, significantly positive correlations were found between infection rate and population (people), cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases, and population density (people•km −2 ) (Table 2) . Similarly, Şahin (2020) reported high correlation between population and total cases in Turkey, and Ahmadi et al. (2020) found significant correlation between population density and total cases in Iran. Interestingly, Hamidi et al. (2020) have reported that at county level in the USA, population density is not significantly related to infection rate possibly because of adherence to social distancing. In low-and middle-income countries though, high population density is commonly associated with informal urban settlements, being social distancing impracticable (Wilkinson 2020) . The sensitivity analysis indicated the importance of the average income and the gross domestic product within the expanded metropolitan area of São Paulo, Brazil (Table 3) possibly due to higher frequency of international traveling of population living in wealthier neighborhoods.As for a different social aspect, significantly negative correlations were found between COVID-19 infection rate and social isolation rate in all analyzed cities (Table 4) , thus indicating that social distancing has been effective in reducing the COVID-19 transmission within the expanded metropolitan area of São Paulo. Furthermore, using graphical analysis, we have observed a consistent trend in all analyzed cities, with increases of confirmed new cases of COVID-19 associated with decreases in social isolation rates (Fig. 2) . Our results corroborate data from recent literature, as Ahmadi et al. (2020) found a significant correlation between COVID-19 cases and intra-provincial traffic in Iran. Using the Spearman correlation test, significantly negative correlations were found between COVID-19 infection rate and UV radiation in all cities with available UV data (5 out of 9 analyzed cities) (Table 4) ; furthermore, the sensitivity analysis pointed out UV radiation as a significant variable (Table 5 ). These findings are consistent with recent literature; for example, Ahmadi et al. (2020) have found the lowest COVID-19 infection rates in provinces with high solar radiation. Furthermore, Schuit et al. (2020) have demonstrated that the influenza virus in aerosols decays more rapidly under simulated sunlight than under dark conditions, and concluded that their results are in accordance with epidemiological data reporting sunlight levels to be inversely correlated to influenza transmission. More importantly, Sagripanti and Lytle (2020) have recently predicted the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by solar UVB in densely populated cities in the world. The authors have estimated that during the winter season in the city of São Paulo, a 41-min exposure to sunlight around solar noon would be required to achieve 90% inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 virus, while a 13-min exposure to sunlight around solar noon could achieve 99% inactivation during the summer season. Therefore, recent literature corroborates our finding that the UV radiation provided by sunlight potentially reduces the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.Significantly negative correlations were also found between COVID-19 infection rate and temperature of three, 7 or 14 days previous to case reports in all cities with available temperature data (9 out of 10 analyzed cities) (Table 4) , thus suggesting that increases in temperature contribute to decreases in COVID-19 transmission in the expanded metropolitan area of São Paulo. Several studies in recent literature have also indicated that temperature is inversely related to COVID-19 incidence Prata et al. 2020; Qi et al. 2020; Şahin 2020; Wu et al. 2020 ). More importantly, some authors have reported that the infection ability of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with temperature increases, and thus, COVID-19 prevention and control are expected to be more effective at warmer weather, being the molecular mechanism thoroughly described elsewhere ).Significant negative correlations were also found between COVID-19 infection rate and wind speed 14 days before case reports in 7 out of 9 analyzed cities (Table 4) , and the sensitivity analysis pointed out wind speed 14 days before case reports as a significant variable (Table 5) . Likewise, Ahmadi et al. (2020) have reported significant inverse correlation between infection rate and wind speed in Iran.Our results reveal that the spread of COVID-19 within the expanded metropolitan area of São Paulo, Brazil, is influenced by the availability of highways. As for social aspects, COVID-19 infection rate was found to be both positively correlated with population density (ρ = 0.46), and negatively correlated with social isolation rate (ρ varying from − 0.39 to − 0.86), hence, indicating that social distancing has been effective in reducing the COVID-19 transmission. Overall, our results show that the COVID-19 transmission within the expanded metropolitan area of São Paulo is inversely correlated with both temperature (ρ varying from − 0.28 to − 0.67) and UV radiation (ρ varying from − 0.28 to − 0.68). Together with recent literature, our study suggests that the UV radiation provided by sunlight potentially contributes to depletion of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-28,9
a4895efe2096f63dab97dfb6b199dd3f55898457,A DEA-Based Complexity of Needs Approach for Hospital Beds Evacuation during the COVID-19 Outbreak,"e past months scourged the world with a novel coronavirus identified as the cause of a pneumonia outbreak first detected in Wuhan, province of Hubei, China. e severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a declared worldwide pandemic having more than a million confirmed cases and dozens of thousands of deaths, keeping a quick spread [1, 2] . e prompt virus outbreak causes a much bigger problem than lethality: a large number of infected patients require hospitalization and intensive care due to complications worsening the clinical condition. When several patients need such intensive care at the same time, the hospitals and other health service units with limited resources end up overloaded. As a result, the health systems collapse due to the unavailability of beds, ventilators, and technical resources for new hospital admissions, fatigue, and overloading health teams.us, hospital beds acquisition and evacuation are crucial to increase the response capacity to face the crisis [3] .Data envelopment analysis is a powerful nonparametric mathematical programming tool for the technical efficiency estimation of many service units in different economic activities, such as financial institutions and educational and health systems [4] [5] [6] [7] . Hospitals are a wide source of efficiency assessments. Some of the most relevant results provide the potential for health improvement based on the expansion of results (e.g., hospitalizations, patient recoveries, performed surgeries, medical prescriptions, among others) or based on the contraction of resources (e.g., nurses, assistants, physicians, infected patients (nondiscretionary), beds, equipment, among others). Such prospects are possible through the envelopment of data, which estimates the industry's efficient production capacity.is study introduces a novel application to provide an optimal number of hospital beds technically feasible to be evacuated and allocated for urgent hospitalizations through best practices, applicable during the COVID-19 crisis. e methodology is based on the Brazilian Healthy Complexity of Needs prioritization and can be extended to any health system with a similar or different classification of disease and medical specialties.e increasing pressure on limited resources of health systems during the pandemic has highlighted the need for efficiency-based tools and methodologies to offer new combined perspectives on how to use the hospital's facilities, resources, and capabilities optimally. Ordu et al. [8, 9] develop an interesting decision support tool for modelling capacity constraints, and allocating hospitals' resources, combining discrete event simulation and forecasting techniques. e application in the accident and emergency department captures the outpatient demand for each specialty by age and first/followup referrals and the entire service pathway on different scenarios. Similar approaches aiming at providing increased operational efficiency and high-quality patient care are claimed to offer a considerable improvement in the hospitals' capacity response and average patient length of stay [10, 11] . A measure for the required number of optimal emergency beds, however, is a limitation acknowledged by the authors in these and other operations approach.e nonparametric frontier estimations of data envelopment analysis can aid managers and policymakers in attaining such a prospect. e weight optimization based on pairwise evaluations scales the used resources and generated products of each service unit, providing a robust measure for the technical efficiency, which can be adapted for inverse output/input relations [12] , exogenous or nondiscretionary resources [13] [14] [15] , and time-series self-evaluations [16] [17] [18] . As a result, an estimation for the optimal production capacity for any size service unit is available for decisionmaking. In the case of hospitalizations, this optimal capacity measure can be translated into an efficient number of hospital beds, equipment, costs, or human resources required for the production of health using internments (hospitalizations) as a proxy for this product.is instrument, besides offering a relative measure for hospitals' technical efficiency based on the maximum, yet feasible, production configuration, can determine peers of efficiency for benchmarking performance metrics and identifying opportunities for improvement and support resource allocation schemas based on production slacks. Many assessments of health efficiency follow this avenue, for instance, the recommendations of Kounetas and Papathanassopoulos [19] regarding the efficiency of Greek hospitals and Zare et al. [20] using a hybrid data envelopment analysis and game theory methodology for performance measurement in health service units. is interesting perspective of frontier estimations can provide the optimal number of resources to be (re-) allocated from inefficient units through best practices during epidemic crises. e most common variables considered in modelling the production technology of health systems are the number of beds for hospitalizations, personal protective equipment (PPE) and other technical equipment, drugs, human capital (physicians, nurses, unlicensed assistants, and other staff), hospital infrastructure, costs of service (in many categories), and funding as inputs, and medical prescriptions, number of hospitalizations, outpatient procedures, inverse mortality rate, patients discharged, number of surgeries, and testing as outputs [6, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Nevertheless, different combinations of output/input can be used in assessments of hospitals' performance, depending on the problem statement and purpose. For instance, Hadad et al. [21] show an interesting nonconventional evaluation which resorts to life expectancy and infant survival rate as the parameters for the health product in two efficiency models, considering the physicians' density, inpatient bed density, expenditures, gross domestic product (GDP), and fruit and vegetable consumption, adding a different perspective in the efficiency assessment.Most hospitals, in general, during the last weeks, and especially intensive care units (ICUs) and emergency departments (EDs) are constantly required to cope with a recurrent daily-based crisis ignited by the novel coronavirus outbreak. Gul & Guneri [27] and Gul et al. [28] discuss the importance of these sectors, dedicated to patients in need of urgent and commonly complex care, in a comprehensive review of literature and evaluation. In addition to the impact on these sectors, the pandemic has affected other specialties that are not directly related to the treatment of respiratory syndromes, where the resource becomes committed in order to prevent the collapse of an entire health system. In most assessments, different conditions and specialties are taken into consideration in several hospital departments, which brings a real contribution of hybrid models to the strategic planning of health service units.e different specialties carried out by health service units are subject to different and varied heterogeneous factors that are connected to institutional arrangements, population characteristics, location, and socioeconomic or environmental determinants. e linear programming scales the differences through the output/input ratio of each health unit by comparing small units with a benchmark in the efficiency frontier presenting similar input-to-output configuration. Nevertheless, such heterogeneity has a considerable subjective value in the decision maker's perspective, which, despite the objective programming techniques, requires value judgments and preference elicitations on different decision criteria. Multiple criteria methodologies, for instance, Pergher & Vaccaro [29] outranking model based on the Electre Tri, Mendonça et al. [30] , grey theory approach for risk assessments, and many others [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , can be relevant adapting on this prospect.e technical efficiency is traditionally understood as a ratio between the generated outputs and used inputs of a production process. Charnes et al. [37] and Banker et al. [38] through a mathematical linear dual formulation for multiple outputs/inputs configurations in the efficiency problem introduced the so-called data envelopment analysis (DEA). Today, this is the most common approach to assess the efficiency and productivity of many decision-making units (DMUs) in the number of surveys, applications, methodologies, and computational developments [39, 40] . e mathematical programming provides, among other results, the optimal amount of resources to save or products to increase so that an inefficient service unit becomes efficient. e multidimensional production structure of hospitals and healthcare centres, however, requires a meticulous approach to define which resources need to be reduced in order to improve the health results. According to Lin & Kuo [41] , different patient's complexity relies on different health service providers for different clinical specialties, which may jeopardize the slack reduction consistency in the technical efficiency analysis because potential performance improvements in hospitalizations by equally reducing the hospital beds, for instance, for all specialties, may be neither feasible nor coherent for each particular hospital context. An interesting solution is suggested by Ferreira and Marques [42] . According to this study, there is no need for complexity adjustment if one accounts for the operational environment surrounding the hospital. Conditional frontier analysis [15, 43] can add an interesting perspective by considering those environmental determinants in the frontier estimation.An alternative avenue through a two-step methodology is proposed in this assessment. Estimations for the beds' evacuation is proposed by prioritizing the slack reduction according to the complexity of needs on the most common medical specialties to provide support for bed reallocations during an epidemic crisis. e first step consists of applying nonparametric frontier estimations for the full production capacity of the health service units (the maximum feasible production configuration for each hospital) based on hospital admissions as the main output and hospital beds as one of the many discretionary resources. Similar to many assessments of health systems efficiency, the number of beds is considered a proxy for hospital capital [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] 44] . at way, depending on the scale of operations and keeping everything else constant, the lower the usage of this resource, the higher the efficiency for the health service unit. Following similar resource optimization approaches [45, 46] , the objective in this assessment is to provide an optimal number of beds to be evacuated and allocated for potential COVID-19 cases, instead of reduction.For the second step, the optimal number of beds to be reallocated (based on best practices) are prioritized according to the complexity of needs for each medical specialty. e complexity of needs in the Brazilian Health System is the degree of complexity each health problem presents and the requirement for specialized knowledge.ere are three categories: basic care, moderate complexity, and high complexity. Each category is defined in Table 1 .Hospitalizations have moderate (ε low ) or high (ε high ) complexity of needs admissions. Consider a set of j � 1, 2, 3, . . . , m health service units using x i |i � 1, 2, 3, . . . , n hospital inputs to produce y r |r � 1, 2, 3, . . . , s outputs. Consider ""o"" the service unit under evaluation and ""ε,"" the sum of both moderate and high complexity of needs hospitalizations, a proxy for the prioritization of beds evacuation. e optimal feasible contraction (evacuations) of high complexity hospitalization beds is as follows:e optimal feasible contraction (evacuations) of moderate complexity beds is as follows:where θ * � min(θ)| ( m j�1 z j x ji ≤ θx oi ; m j�1 z j y jr ≥ y or ; m j�1 z j � 1& z j ≥ 0) is the efficiency score for the production technology under variable returns to scale [9, 14] .Equations (1) and (2) state that the optimal number for beds evacuation of high complexity admissions depends on the number of evacuated beds of moderate complexity. In other words, the optimal number for beds evacuation of high complexity hospitalizations is the remaining feasible contraction of beds after all moderate complexity admissions are evacuated. As an example, considering an efficiency score θ * � 0.8, the service unit may improve efficiency by producing the same result using (1-0.8) � 20% fewer resources. Considering 100 hospital beds allocated to admissions of both low and high complexity of needs as the discretionary input |ε low � 15 and ε high � 85, the number of beds to be evacuated having moderate complexity is Ev A− � ε low � 15 beds and the number of beds to be evacuated having high complexity is the remaining Ev A+ � ε(1 − θ) − ε low � 20 − 15 � 5 beds.Adding (1) and (2) into the DEA formulation, we can infer the optimal number for beds evacuation (Ev A ) based on the complexity of needs prioritization:Full concepts and definitions concerning the complexity of needs assistance in the Brazilian Health System and a list with the related medical specialties are available in [47].In the first step of the evaluation, an input-oriented variable returns to scale model is conducted. Pernambuco's State Secretariat for Budgeting and Planning (SEPLAG) provided data regarding 373 from the 1136 health services units in the state. For this assessment, we have selected the 88 most important hospitals and healthcare centres based on the volume of hospitalizations. Due to data limitations, the number of doctors, surgeons, and general physicians is not considered in the analysis. For most medical specialties, ward rounds for inpatient care by physicians occur once a day or after a week, depending on the patient treatment plan or condition. is context let us assume that the inclusion or removal of these professionals may not shift the efficiency prospects compared to nurses and other health staff which are in direct contact with hospitalizations. e inputs are the number of nurses, nursing assistants, and licensed healthcare technicians and the cost of hospitalizations and the sum of hospital beds for three categories (specialties): medical clinics (comprehensive care for individuals aging over 12 years, in critical or semicritical conditions, and who do not need surgical treatment), surgical clinics (reserved for preoperative and postoperative care), and obstetrics. e output is the number of hospital internments (hospitalizations). Table 2 and Figure 1 report the main descriptive statistics. Costs refer only to hospitalizations expenditure considering the three specialties. On average, R$ 8,073,821 (about US$ 1.5 million) is spent per health unit in hospitalizations for a typical year. Nursing assistants and nursing technicians are two professional categories working in outpatient sectors usually performing basic care planned by the nurse, such as administration of medicines, vaccines, dressings, performing patient hygiene, and sterilization of medical equipment. Due to the similarity of both categories, they were aggregated into one input named ""assistants and technicians"".In general, the 88 most important health units in the state sums 16336 of those professionals, 5452 nurses, and 12388 beds, spent more than R$ 710 million (about US$ 132 million) in one year, and were responsible for 462175 hospitalizations and 5252 hospitalizations per unit on average. is means 0.07% (88 hospitals) were responsible for 27.02% of all hospitalizations in the state. Figure 1 illustrates the descriptive statistics in boxplots visualizations. Most of the outliers are public hospitals characterized by a high demand for health services.Tables 3 and 4 summarize the main results. We have 26 hospitals working at full capacity in the state, serving as peers Table 1 : Complexity of needs categories. Basic care: the first level is characterized by a set of actions and practices using low-density technologies to solve health issues of greater frequency but low severity, including a list of simpler and cheaper procedures. e procedures in this category are capable of meeting most of the community's common health problems. Moderate complexity: composed of actions and services aiming at meeting the main public health issues whose assistance in the clinical practice requires the availability of specialized professionals and the usage of technological resources for diagnostic, support, and treatment. High complexity: common for more severe health issues; this category is characterized by a set of procedures involving high technology and high cost, aiming at providing access to highly specialized knowledge and qualified services.(benchmarks) for the remaining inefficient health units. ese units are producing the maximum possible admissions a hospital can produce during a year given the current production technology, equipment, and human resource. It is worth mentioning that, for some of the ranked hospitals, the efficiency comes at the cost of quality due to the high demand for health services and overcrowded public hospitals. e total of 3772 beds are feasible to be evacuated and reallocated for new COVID-19 cases in one year considering the remaining inefficient units formalization of new service protocols, postponing surgeries and decreasing the patient length of stay in hospitals through best practices from the peers, of which 2883 are related to moderate hospitalizations and 889 high complex cases. Table 4 has the remaining hospitals and their potential for bed evacuation during the crisis. Figure 2 illustrates the overall production capacity with the efficiency frontier estimation by the envelopment of data under a variable returns to scale technology. In the visualization of Figure 2 , the inputs in the x label are aggregated by simple summing with no specific weight for this aggregation. One should be alerted that a multiple-input to one output plot may not necessarily place the multiefficient health service units on the two-dimensional frontier, serving only illustration purposes. e traditional radial variable returns to scale model can be the most interesting option for the objective of incorporating the complexity of needs in a second step defining the feasible options for resource evacuation among the specialties. Because of the characteristic of data (beds available by medical specialties), we can prioritize the reduction of beds (and related resources uniformly) according to the complexity of their specialty. e points on the frontier represent the efficient hospitals reported in Table 3 , which are benchmarks for best practices. e remaining inefficient units (under the frontier) in this illustration become efficient either by producing more hospitalizations with the same level of used inputs or by reducing the used inputs keeping hospitalizations at the same level or by a combination of both. In the input-oriented model of this assessment, efficiency is obtained by reducing (and reallocating) the number of beds keeping the same amount of hospitalization. is can be possible by applying some of the benchmark strategies for reducing the length of stay. In this representation, the most inefficient unit (the most distant point from the frontier) is one of the most important private hospitals in the state, having a considerable number of available beds for reallocation in a typical year. Table 5 reports the main prospects for the assessment. e evacuation of hospital beds are prioritized according to the complexity of needs for the many medical specialties each health service units operate. e monthly estimates are evacuation projections based on the efficient production capacity of hospitals, which can be used during the pandemic critical months. Twenty-three out of the 57 health service units with potential for bed evacuations do not require high complexity evacuations.

Due to the many particular differences regarding the production technology of hospitals, an approach based on internal rather than industrial capacity can be more deductive and coherent.Another interesting value can be added by the definition of beds' evacuation based on multiple decision criteria besides the complexity of needs. Important clinical aspects of hospital internments such as the gravity of diseases, flexibility for resource transfer among the medical specialties, and substitution potential can orientate decisions of managers and policymakers closer to each health unit reality. In addition, the usage of fuzzy data for the assessment of network system such as a hospital can aid valuable support [48] .is analysis can provide a direction for public administrations to perform some of their strategies based on an objective quantitative production capacity measure and support subjective decision-making with the inclusion of such aspects.An extension of the current application investigating the efficiency evolution and the hospitalization efficacy against COVID-19 can be very useful for policymakers. A timeseries evaluation, as suggested by Nepomuceno et al. [49] , can be performed using time-series data regarding the period before and after the implementation of beds reallocation schema based on each specialty complexity of needs.e first results of this assessment were disclosed to state authorities, hoping to contribute to how to mitigate the drastic effects of the current crisis in the available resources.Readers can access the data related to the findings of this study upon request.e authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.

c13b4502445249c2792ee4ece4321ffdc4095b02,Submetido para TEMA One Study of COVID-19 Spreading at The United States -Brazil -Colombia 1,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic causes the COVID-19 disease, for which we have no immune response or vaccine. The origin of COVID-19 is believed to have occurred in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. From China, the disease was rapidly transmitted globally by individuals who travelled to Europe and The United States.On the America continent, the rst cases of COVID-19 appeared in The UnitedStates. On January 21, 2020, the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conrmed the rst case of COVID-19 in a 35-year-old man from 3% of the total number of reported cases in the American continent [4] .The United States, Brazil and Colombia are in dierent moments in the epidemiological process, Colombia is in the exponential growth phase, Brazil is probably in the peak of the epidemic, while The United States is already experiencing a second wave of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection. It is noteworthy that these three countries have very dierent Human Development Indexes (HDI) and territorial dimensions and, even so, they have in common high infection rates by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.The objective of this article is to carry out a mathematical study of the possible trends of the epidemic by COVID-19 in these three countries. This article was based on the data provided by the WHO [4] and the Susceptibles-Infectious-Recovered-Dead model, the SIRD model [5] [6] .The SIRD model is a classic compartmental model of the Kermack -McKendrick type [7] [8] . Compartmental models divide the population into several different compartments, for example, Susceptible population, Infectious population, Recovered population, Dead population, among others, and specify how individuals move through the compartments over time. Despite being a simple mathematical model, the SIRD is one of the most applied mathematical models to understand the current health crisis. Obviously, more realistic and complex models would better describe the dynamics of this epidemic, but data and information about COVID-19 are lacking to implement them. Reviews of epidemiological models can be found in [5] [6] .Regarding the adjustment of the parameters of the SIRD model for The United States, Brazil and Colombia, it appears that these parameters change frequently, depending on local political factors (closure of non-essential establishments, quarantine, movement restrictions...) [9] , socio-economic factors (social and hygienic behaviors, lower per-capita income...) [10] [11] , climatic factors (temperature, humidity, average wind speed, UV index...) [12] , among others. In this context, it was decided to adjust the parameters of the SIRD model over time, based on data made available by WHO, using non-linear least squares methods [13] [14] .There are several mathematical modelling of the COVID-19 at the moment. But, to this work we considering the SIRD's model given by equations:t, S, I, R, D are time, susceptible, infected, recovered and death variables, respectively;N is an average population value;β is an infection rate, and γ R and γ D are recover and death rates, these parameters are calculated per day.At the initial time we haveand for end time, denoted by t F , we admittedThe condition (2.3) was considered because at this moment the disease nished and the equations' steady state stays established.The model (2.1) has 4 ordinary dierential equations (ODE). Specically, any ODE can be written astherefore, all deductive numeric procedure at this work will be over equation (2.4) .The temporal discret grid considered is showed at the Figure (1) . We denoted the time lapse like ∆t, and the end time t F = (s − 1) ∆t. The value k is a time counter, thereby k = s means temporal nodes' total value.and the Neumann condition (2.3) we have tooWith respect to temporal derivative of the equations (2.4), they are approximated by forward second order nite dierence in the node k dΦ l dtsimilarly, the equations (2.6) are approximated by backward second order nite dierence at the last node s dΦ l dtThese approximations were used to obtain improved numerical results.(2.10)The equality (2.10) is an our temporal dierence equation, that describe the COVID-19 behaviour. We want to explain that the equation (2.10) is the temporal evolution for Φ l . Numerically, from Figure (2), setting s we have to vary k = 1, . . . , s − 2 to obtain the dierences' equations at the points k = 2, . . . , s − 1. values were explicit. But they are unknown! Thus, we use a iterative strategy to solve the system (2.11) how presented in [23] .Without loss of generality, if s = 4 the system (2.11) becomesl whose the iterative process associated can be likewhere IT = 0, 1, . . . , IT M AX , and IT M AX means iteration maximum number. Particularly, we have a linear system to each specic IT . Furthermore, we choose the Gauss-Seidel method to solve (2.12) because the convergence is guaranteed. it is easy to see that the Sassenfeld criterium is veried. The stopped criteria value of the Gauss-Seidel method used in this work was 10 −7 . When IT = 0 the system (2.12) becomesso that:• Φ 1 l is known (initial condition);• Ψ 1 l = Ψ 1 l Φ 1 l is known, of course;• 0 Ψ 2 l = Ψ 1 l is admitted how our prediction hypothesis.Thus, we have the linear system's solutionGauss-Seidel method. Now, if IT = 1 we ndso that 1 Ψ 2 l = Ψ l 1 Φ l is our prediction hypothesis again. It solving (2.14), we getAfter this, if the 2 Φ 2 is less than one (which means an end to the spread of covid-19) we accept the 2 Φ l ≡ Φ l as numerical solution of the SIRD's (2.4) at the time t = 2∆t. Otherwise, we set s = 5 and do the all process again to a new time t = 3∆t, and so on.The numerical process nishes if we get the m Φ 2 < 1 to some 0 < m < IT M AX .Finally, we have some gains with strategy provided here:• our implicit methodology does not need a severe restriction on the ∆t value.The implicit method together with Gauss-Seidel and Lax's law guarantee it. Besides, the t F time is discovered in the computational run's time. To performance all simulation we developed a fortran 90 code that solve the SIRD's governing equations from auxiliary conditions.The parameters' optimization in the SIRD (2.1) is done as in [24, 25] , that is, solving a nonlinear least square problem. We dene the vector function u(t) = (S(t), I(t), R(t), D(t)), the vectors of parameters q = (β, γ R , γ D ) and the known data y at times t 1 , . . . t n . Given a function F (u, q), we estimate the parameters q by solving the following nonlinear least square problemThe trust-region based method adapted in the lsqnonlin Matlab function is used for the constrained optimization problem (2.15).In this section we introduce our analyse of the COVID-19 and simulations as well.Resumo. O presente trabalho trata do espalhamento da COVID-19 sobre os Estados Unidos, Brasil e Colômbia. Embora os países exibam diferenças no desenvolvimento econômico, mas similaridades tais como dimensão continental ou interação social, a propagação do COVID-19 neles tem algumas semelhanças.

76f11d8da9153e8b0501eb5f4998f022528487cd,Brazilian Child Protection Professionals' Resilient Behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"As the Coronavirus raged into a full-blown pandemic in 2020, professionals worldwide scrambled to adjust their working lives to the new realities of a restricted and often homebound world. Child protection professionals (CPPs; e.g., social workers, pediatricians, psychologists, lawyers) undertook the onerous task of transitioning traditionally face-to-face assessments, visits, and services to a remote format, while also supporting their clients, whose resources were already depleted, through these difficult times (Prime, Wade, & Browne, 2020) . Understandably, concerns have been raised about the state of these working conditions, including whether the stressors of this worldwide crisis have decreased how frequently CPPs practice resilient behaviors.Research has consistently shown that individuals who engage in resilient behaviors, such as attending to mental health and utilizing stress-reducing practices, are better able to adapt and respond to adversity (Liu, Reed, & Girard, 2017; Masten & Motti-Stefanidi, 2020; Masten, 2019) . Little work, however, has considered these practices in a developing economy, such as Brazil's, and no study as to which we are aware has done so in the face of an ongoing pandemic. A crisis that has diminished agencies' financial resources to support resilient practices, impacted families' support from schools and daycare, and potentially dampened individuals' abilities to create space for self-care. In addition to potentially decreasing the availability of support, the pandemic further blurred the lines between work, family, and personal life, increasing the interdependent needs between those systems.Brazil presents the ideal environment within which to consider how context and the pandemic intertwine to differentially affect professionals' practice. As a developing economy, Brazil's regions vary vastly as to the conditions within which the professionals work, including the level of support provided by their workplace for resilient practices, the socio-economic status of their locale, and the rates of child abuse. By surveying child protection workers throughout Brazil in the context of the Coronavirus pandemic, this study aims to provide a richer understanding of how the pandemic has impacted CPPs throughout Brazil and how their professional context predicts differences in the utilization of resilient behaviors. In so doing, these results will inform responses to this and other national and international crises.As the frontline response to child abuse and neglect, CPPs fairly consistently report highly stressful working conditions and frequently report feelings of burnout McFadden, Mallett, Campbell, & Taylor, 2019; Miller, Donohue-Dioh, Niu, & Shalash, 2018) . CPPs, under the best of conditions, navigate the challenges of empathetically responding to abuse allegations and familial distress, as well as supporting individuals facing poverty and vulnerability. Increasingly high caseloads and issues with overload are unfortunately typical for CPPs (Ellett, Ellis, Westbrook, & Dews, 2007; Griffiths, Royse, Culver, Piescher, & Zhang, 2017) . These demanding work environments lead to frequent job turnover and increase the risk of health problems such as burnout, anxiety, depression, and greater consumption of cigarettes and alcohol (McFadden et al., 2019; Sherwood et al., 2019) .Not all professionals reveal such negative effects. Indeed, many professionals are highly resilient even in the face of stressful working conditions (Masten & Wright, 2010) . Resilience is considered a fundamental construct for understanding who overcomes adversity (Masten, 2018) . Although definitions of resilience vary widely, resilience can be viewed as the integrated and interdependent systems that affect an individual's ability to adapt to challenging situations (Masten & Cicchetti, 2016) . Some researchers have proposed that our understanding of who thrives and who suffers during trying professional times, such as a pandemic, can be best understood using models that highlight the numerous systems and factors working to support or dampen resilience (Liu et al., 2017; Masten & Wright, 2010) .One model for understanding professional resilience is the Multi-System Model of Resilience proffered by Liu and colleagues (2017) . This model argues that resilience is fostered through intra-individual, interpersonal, and socio-ecological factors. Intra-individual factors can include differences between individuals, including background or beliefs or attitudes. Socio-ecological factors, also termed external resilience, consist of the ""larger formal and informal institutions that facilitate coping and adjustment representative of community resilience."" This includes policies and procedures in place in the work environment as well as community support structures, which are sometimes measured via the Human Development Index (HDI).Brazilian CPPs face a diverse set of socio-ecological factors that may impact resilience in their work and home environments. For instance, Brazilian cities range on the Human Development Index from 0.862, similar to France during the same period, to 0.418, similar to the Democratic Republic of Congo (Programa das Nações Unidas para o Desenvolvimento (PNUD), 2013; United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 2019). Brazilian CPPs workers also face increasing pressures such as those regarding their own safety or from ensuring that cases of abuse and neglect are reported (Silva-Oliveira, Ferreira, Alencar, Ferreira, & Zarzar, 2020).Little work, however, has considered how these socio-ecological factors influence CPPs workers' engagement in resilience behaviors generally but also specifically within a context as trying as the Coronavirus pandemic. Even fewer studies have considered these predictors within a developing economy, such as Brazil's. Researchers, however, have consistently noted the need for a greater understanding of the role that working environments and professionals' beliefs have on the utilization of resilient behaviors (McFadden et al., 2019; Miller et al., 2018) . Here, we attempt to address this gap in the literature.To that end, this study had three distinct aims. First, to survey the current working conditions of Brazilian CPPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, to analyze rates of resilient or self-care behaviors practiced by CPPs during the pandemic. Third, to consider both individual predictors, such as perceptions of the importance of resilient behaviors, and socio-ecological predictors, including support by one's job, work hours, and HDI index, of such behaviors. Further, we consider the relation between these predictors and three categories of resilience behaviors that reflect the three categories of predictors recognized by Liu and colleagues: individual (personal resilience behaviors), interpersonal (familial resilience behaviors), and socio-ecological (career or workplace resilience behaviors). These data will hopefully help enrich our understanding of the factors that promote resilience, even in the most difficult times and for professionals facing some of the most difficult working conditions, to bolster these individuals' ability to help better the lives of the children and families that they support (Masten & Monn, 2015; Masten & Motti-Stefanidi, 2020 ).Three hundred and nine professionals working in child protection related fields (e.g., psychologists, social workers, professors, pediatricians, nurses, and other clinicians) completed at least 80% of the survey (269 females). On average, the professionals were approximately 40.26 years of age (SD = 10.27). We obtained a wide geographic spread with professionals from 86 cities and all five regions in Brazil. Most of the participants were from the South (n=203) and Southeast (n=80) regions, and 16 were from the other regions (i.e., North, Northeast and Central). This distribution is comparable to previous studies that report a significantly higher number of professionals in the Southeast-South axis, when compared to the other regions (Bastos & Gomes, 2014 ; Conselho Federal de Psicologia (CFP), 2020; Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais Anísio Teixeira (INEP), 2019; Sheffer et al., 2018) . Additional demographic details can be found in Table 1 .The Demographics Questionnaire gathered information on participants' basic demographics, including their age, the years that they have worked in their profession, and their gender. Participants responded to questions regarding their occupation by stating which of the relevant child protection professions they practiced (e.g., psychiatrist, attorney, judge, and researcher).This measure was created specifically for this study to measure CPPs' perceptions of work conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were asked about their weekly workload before and after the pandemic started, services available at their city, participants' perceptions of COVID-19's impact on both their professional community, and the number of child abuse cases.HDI is a United Nations measurement of standard of living, life expectancy, and educational opportunities. The authors collected the Human Development Index for each city where the participants indicated that they worked (UNDP, 2019).In this measure, the professionals were specifically directed to respond thinking about their role as CPPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants scored 14 resilience practices as to their: (1) Importance: whether they thought that item was important (important/not important), (2) Level of Work Support: if their work supports, enables, or permits them to perform that item (yes/no), Note. Health professionals -includes physicians, nurses, speech therapists and physical therapists; Legal professionals -includes lawyers and child protective services professionals.and (3) Behavior: if they performed that item or activity (yes/no). Three categories of resilient behaviors were measured: personal resilience (e.g., ""Caring about my own mental health""; ""Time available for hobbies/exercises/meditation""); familial resilience (e.g., ""Time for family-work balance""; ""Shared household tasks""); and career resilience (e.g., ""Direct communication with work during the pandemic""; ""Shared responsibility at work"").This research was approved by the Institutional Review Board prior to the start of the research study (approval number 32833920.3.0000.8040). CPPs were contacted about the possibility of participating in this study via several relevant-professional Facebook groups and snowball sampling (Baltar & Brunet, 2012) . Participants received a general invitation that stated the goals of the research and that provided an anonymous link for participation. Participants were asked to share the invitation with their relevant contacts and through their own social media pages. Following Brazilian guidelines, no personal information related to participants was stored by the researchers and no financial compensation was provided for participation.Data was collected during a time when the Coronavirus was still ongoing worldwide and was at a particularly heightened state in Brazil. For instance, during the time period in which the data was collected, the average number of daily cases was 36,070 and there were approximately 1,022 deaths per day. To ensure relative stability during a time of fluctuating health and legal conditions, data was collected during a fifteen-day time period ranging from mid-June to early July in 2020. During this time, laws regarding isolation and virus-based restrictions varied in Brazil based on the municipality. The majority of states, however, required social isolation and limited businesses to only those deemed as essential. Public adherence to those laws and guidelines was mixed, with social isolation ranging from 38.2% to 39.6% during data collection (InLoco, 2020), lower than the 60% (Aquino et al., 2020) to 70% (Canabarro et al., 2020) thought necessary to control the pandemic.Participants who consented to take part in the study first completed the demographics measures. Order of the following measures was randomized between participants to ensure that there were not any order effects. Within each measure, the items were also randomized. Participants were thanked for their time and invited to engage in several exercises to help support resilience: watching a relaxation video, doing a crossword puzzle, or reading a paper by one of the authors about fostering children's resilience.Preliminary analyses considered the variance and correlations between the key theorized and non-theorized variables using SPSS 22 (IBM Corporation, 2013 ). Next, we tested our model analyzing the effects of both intra-individual (i.e., level of importance) and socio-ecological (i.e., job support) predictors on reports of utilization of resilient behaviors during the pandemic (Fig. 1) . To that end, we performed a Path Analysis assessing the direct and indirect effects of ratings of the import of the relevant resilient behaviors on the mean number of behaviors practiced. We also tested whether the individual predictor of importance was mediated by the socio-ecological predictor of job support. The effects of these predictors were tested on CPP's reports of three categories of resilient behaviors (i.e., personal, familial, and career) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These three categories of behaviors mirror the three factors of resiliency set out by Liu and colleagues (i.e., individual, interpersonal, and socio-ecological).To avoid the impact of non-parametric variables, confidence intervals (95%) for the estimated parameters and standard errors were presented by bootstrapping the sample (n=1000). For this analysis we used ML estimators and the following criteria for adjustment indices (CFI > 0.95; TLI > 0.95; RMSEA < 0.10 and SRMR < 0.10). For these analyzes, the Lavaan package (Rosseel, 2012) was implemented using the JASP program (JASP Team, 2020).We first present descriptive statistics concerning the participants' reports of CPPs' working conditions in Brazil during the pandemic (Table 2) . Most, though not all, professionals reported a decrease in their work hours after the pandemic started. Those professionals reporting an increase in works hours primarily worked in either education, healthcare, or psychology (94.94%). Although the mean hours worked before the pandemic was not statistically significant between those who reported working more (vs. less) hours after the pandemic, a t-test revealed a significant difference (t (184) = -11.56, p = 0.03) in reported work hours between those professionals whose hours increased when compared to those who reported a decrease after the pandemic started (Table 2) .Most professionals stated that they could not tell if the number of child abuse cases had changed since the start of the pandemic (47.5%). Of those who opined as to an overall change, a majority (25.8%) said that there was an increase, 18.3% believed the numbers had remained stable, and a minority (5.3%) thought there had been a decrease. Although most CPPs reported that they do not conduct home visits (65.8%), a minority of participants (10.8%) reported that they normally do conduct or should conduct such visits but are not during the pandemic.Initial correlations were run to test for relations between theorized and non-theorized variables (Table 3) . HDI did not play a significant role in any of the key variables so it was excluded from further analyses.Based on the theoretical model proposed by Liu and colleagues (2017) and Masten and Motti-Stefanidi (2020), we ran a path analysis utilizing the model shown in Fig. 1 . The model was well-adjusted to the data (χ 2 (18) = 34.21, p = 0.012) and revealed satisfactory fit (CFI = 0.98; TLI = 0.98; RMSEA = 0.05[CI 90% 0.03-0.08]; SRMR = 0.04).The parameter estimates for all of the variables, including the direct and indirect effects, are shown in Table 4 . In this model, the intra-individual factor of importance directly predicted engaging in resilient behaviors across all three categories (e.g., personal, career, and familial). The effect of importance was also mediated by the socio-ecological context of work, such that work also played a key role in predicting utilizing resilient behaviors during a pandemic.Reflecting conditions felt by professionals throughout the world, CPPs within a developing country like Brazil consistently reported (almost 90%) a negative impact from COVID-19. The pandemic, however, has not had universally deleterious effects on the Brazilian child protection community. Indeed, even in the face of increased stressors, CPPs reported that they were still engaging in resilient behaviors. Similar to studies prior to the pandemic (Miller et al., 2018) , CPPs engaged in moderate levels of self-care or resilient behaviors. Professionals whose workplace supported resilient practices were more likely to engage in these behaviors, across all three domains of resilience studied here (i.e., individual, family, and career). Indeed, a supportive work environment mediated the relation between beliefs of the import of the behavior and actual practice. These findings indicate that the workplace is a key factor in fostering CPPs' performance of adaptive behaviors. Liu and colleagues' (2017) socio-ecological framework proposes that resilience is a continuous exchange between different systems (e.g., intra-personal, interpersonal, and socio-ecological) and that these systems can bolster or hinder individuals' adaptation to adversities (see also Masten & Motti-Stefanidi, 2020) . Within our data, both intra-personal (beliefs of the importance of resilient behaviors) and socio-ecological predictors (job support) played a role in whether individuals engaged in resilient behaviors during the pandemic. These results are not without effect as resilient behaviors can lower stress, while also mobilizing adaptive systems during adverse times (Arnup & Bowles, 2016; Cull, Frintner, Starmer, & Leslie, 2019; García-Carmona, Marín, & Aguayo, 2019; McFadden et al., 2019; McKinley, Boland, & Mahan, 2017; Pradas-Hernández et al., 2018; Rosenberg, 2018) .Our results further bolster Liu et al.'s (2017) model's placement of an individuals' resiliency within the context of their community. Indeed, here it was not simply the individual's views of importance that mattered in predicting resilient behaviors but also the workplace's support for such behaviors. Both individual and socio-ecological factors predicted resilient behaviors across all three potential contexts: personal, familial, and career. Providing additional empirical support for the theory that systems are interdependent on one another and can differentially impact resiliency.Although the predictors were significant for engaging in such practices for each of these categories, workplace (or career) support had the largest effect on practicing career resilient behavior. These results bolster the idea that work support is crucial to the development of resilient behavior. Changing work conditions to promote time and resources to enable professionals to engage in resilient behavior should be a priority during and after the pandemic. Public policies aimed at promoting better working conditions and increasing workplace support for resilient behavior must be at the forefront of advocacy for CPPs.Our findings do not imply that a singular resilience policy or practice would benefit all professionals. For instance, despite the benefits of Johnson, Emmons, Rivard, Griffin, and Dusek's (2015) mindfulness trainings on lowering professionals' depression and anxiety, the authors acknowledge that intra-individual differences may exist regarding the success of this intervention (see Zhu, Wekerle, Lanius, and Frewen (2019) finding that trauma-related symptoms predict increased distress during meditation). Indeed, as all of our measures, other than HDI, are self-report, we cannot ascertain whether it is the actual levels of workplace support that predict CPPs' practice of resilient behaviors or if it is the individuals' interpretation of that support. In other words, two CPPs in the same workplace may differently interpret cues of support and, resultingly, engage in different levels of behavior.Instead of proscribing a set policy for either the workplace or even for CPPs, the COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity for researchers and professionals to come together to better understand the diverse needs of the professionals who help abused and neglected children. The pandemic's challengin context is a springboard for ongoing discussions about front-line professionals' working conditions, including how the pandemic affects their mental health (Fiorillo & Gorwood, 2020; Golberstein, Wen, & Miller, 2020; Greenberg, Docherty, Gnanapragasam, & Wessely, 2020; Pfefferbaum & North, 2020 ; World Health Organization (WHO), 2020). CPPs are asked every day to balance an incredible number of emotionally taxing tasks. Here, we show that the environment within which they work is a key factor in ensuring their stability and success.Of note, HDI did not correlate with any of the variables of interest in this model. This may be because organizations are leveraging resources that are generally available online or creating national infrastructures that span socio-economic context, such as mindfulness training (Johnson et al., 2015) . Due to the limitations of this study, such as not having data on the funding support for participants' individual places of work (e.g., working in a rich city does not equate with a well-funded nonprofit), we advise extreme caution in interpreting these findings. Future research is critical to understanding the role of HDI in the work life of CPPs and the practice of resilient behaviors.In addition to those noted above, these findings must be couched in a number of key limitations. First, despite having variability in the cities and regions in which participants work, further sampling might be necessary to recruit participants in smaller cities and Northern regions. CPPs in isolated communities may have access to fewer resources and increased caseloads. Second, our study cannot draw conclusions about how engaging in resilient behaviors impacts the professionals and the children they support (Palma-García, Gómez Jacinto, & Hombrados-Mendieta, 2018), both during the pendency of this pandemic and after it concludes. Third, we do not consider here many aspects of the work environment that may play a role in professionals' success, including provision of necessary protective gear during a pandemic, job flexibility, and open and honest communications about mental health. Indeed, studying the ongoing provision of these supports (e.g., beyond a t-shirt giveaway or a singular day of recognition) may be vital to understanding how the pandemic and other similarly stressful environments differentially affect whether professionals engage in resilient behaviors. Finally, this research did not explore a variety of intra-individual predictors of work-related beliefs, engagement, and expectations. Future research could greatly expand on understanding how these factors may shape either perceptions or practice of CPPs in the workplace. CPPs stand on the frontlines of defense for families in the greatest states of crisis. These professionals' places of work can buffer them from secondary trauma by supporting resilient behaviors. Our study shows that even in times of international crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, work support for resilient behaviors matters, potentially over and above community resources as indexed by HDI. Although this study provides preliminary evidence for bolstering professional support to increase resilient behavior, future research can deepen the understanding of resilience systems (individual, family, and work-related) on decreasing burnout. This can help ensure these incredibly hard-working professionals can continue to provide the care that these children and families so desperately need.The authors report no declarations of interest.",Brazil,first author,2020-09-04,9
585c63a40bc6587c3651fb8a4abb544304e19a83,Behavioral and sociodemographic predictors of anxiety and depression in patients under epidemiological surveillance for COVID-19 in Ecuador,". One month later, the presence of this disease was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the general director of the World Health Organization (WHO). As of April 30, 2020, the WHO [2] registered a total of 3,090,445 COVID-19 confirmed cases worldwide and 217,769 confirmed deaths. In total, 213 countries, areas, or territories were affected by the COVID-19 by then. The rapid spread of the virus throughout the world has forced local and national administrations to take unprecedented measures to reduce the impact of this pandemic [3] . The measures included active surveillance for suspected cases, self-isolation or social distancing, restrictions for travel and transportation, and even shutting down country boarders [4] .In this scenario, isolation, economic recession, pressure on health professionals and inequities in access to care and disparities in outcomes according to socioeconomic status have resulted in reactive anxiety, depression, and even the presence of suicide attempts in the general population [5, 6] . The most vulnerable groups to develop these symptoms seems to be women, young adults (> 35 years), people with low income or unemployed and singles [7] . This situation has led to actions by multiple nations aimed at understanding the mental health consequences for the general population as well as the most vulnerable groups under the pandemic conditions as a priority for researchers in the area [8] .Two studies conducted in China [9, 10] using a survey format directed towards a general adult population in February 2020, indicated that 28-35% of the participants had experienced symptoms of generalized anxiety disorders and 16-20% symptoms of depression. In the same country, the study conducted by Wang, Di, Ye, & Wei [11] indicated that gender, age, education and type of job are some demographic related factors that are associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Females presented higher levels of anxiety as well as people above 40 years old. Additionally, depression levels were higher in people with a bachelor's degree when compared with people with a master's degree, and industrial service workers had a higher probability of having depression in comparison to highly qualified professionals. When considering the psychological effects of the pandemic for those diagnosed with COVID-19, that group presented with a high prevalence of depression (29.2%) and anxiety (20.8%) in a recent study [12] .Not only sociodemographic variables have been studied in relation to the presence of psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic; some studies have also identified the association of the presence of modifiable behavioral factors on the development and / or maintenance of mental health problems like anxiety and depression [13, 14] . Huang et al. [9] identified that focusing on information about COVID-19 for three or more hours per day may act as a risk factor for the presence of anxiety. In Germany [15] , a similar study found that revising this information for more than two hours and a half and/or more than seven times per day is related with critical symptoms of depression and anxiety and increased phobic fear of COVID-19. However, Zhong et al. [16] . reported that having more information about COVID-19 was significantly associated with a lower probability of developing negative attitudes during confinement. Another variable which has been associated with mental health is the engagement in physical activity. The number of days that the person exercise during the confinement has been related with lower levels of depression and anxiety [7] , but also the reduction of regular physical activity has been related with greater levels of anxiety concerning with COVID-19 topics [17] . Moreover, some other behaviors have been recommended to reduce psychological distress during the confinement based on previous evidence. Altena et al. [18] have proposed the maintenance of daily routines to better coping with the psychological consequences of the pandemic. Isolation is one of the most challenging situation under these circumstances, and as a result Brooks et al. [6] have indicated that the activation of remote social networking can help to reduce immediate anxiety and long-term distress. All these modifiable behaviors are some of the considerations included as part of the messages that should be promoted in communications to support mental health of the population prepared by the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Use [19] .Most of the reported studies about the mental health impact of the COVID-19 have been conducted in China, which is understandable since this was the first country affected by the pandemic. Despite the usefulness of these data, demographic and inter-individual characteristics are determining factors in the psychological responses of different populations to a largescale stressful event such as COVID-19 [20] . For this reason, it is essential to increase the volume of studies evaluating the impact of this pandemic in each of the affected countries, especially in countries such as Ecuador, which has been one of the most affected countries by the pandemic, by April 2020 it presented the highest rates of mortality in Latin America [21] .We have reported briefly a comparison of depression and anxiety symptoms between persons confirmed and suspect of COVID-19 in Ecuador [22] , however we have not deepen on the analysis of the variables related to the presence of these symptoms. The purpose of the present study is to analyze that data in order to assess the mental health symptoms and associated sociodemographic variables and behaviors during the confinement of people who were part of the epidemiological surveillance program for COVID-19 established by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health during March and April 2020.A cross-sectional analysis was designed to evaluate the self-reported mental health symptoms in relation to sociodemographic variables and modifiable behaviors presented during the confinement by persons under the epidemiological surveillance program for COVID-19 in Ecuador from March 22 th to April 18 th , 2020.This study was conducted in Ecuador, a country located in South America split in four main regions: 1) the Coastal region, 2) the Highland or Sierra region, 3) the Amazon region and 4) the Insular region. Coastal region presented higher mortality rates than the other regions as consequences of late implementing restrictive measures of social distancing and limited capacity of health services [23] . The population of Ecuador was estimated to be 17,510,643 inhabitants based on the latest available projections for 2020 [24] .This ongoing monitoring by the health department was the result of contact tracing strategy deployed by the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) among confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients in Ecuador. The Mental Health Department at the MoPH in Ecuador lead the active surveillance with mental health personnel from the districts, which deployed the online selfreporting tool among patients. A non-probabilistic sampling strategy was used from the beginning of the study until quota was reached. Using the methodology described by Ortiz-Prado et al. 2020 [23] , a total number of completed answers reached 856 patients in order to achieve 99% confidence. The included patients in this study were adults (> = 18 years old) who were under epidemiological surveillance for being diagnosed with or suspected to have COVID-19 following exposure, and who voluntarily responded to the survey.Sociodemographic information and behaviors during the confinement. The main sociodemographic variables were recorded such as age, gender, employment, place of residence and educational attainment. The behaviors during the confinement were collected through four specific questions 1) are you maintaining regular schedule to eat and to sleep? 2) are you exercising regularly? 3) how many people are you interacting daily through online social networks? 4) how much time are you spending daily to get information about COVID-19? Psychological and emotional status were assessed using the following measures.Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [25] . It is a brief self-report questionnaire to measure the severity of depressive symptoms in adults. Scores from one to four indicate presence of minimal symptoms, from five to nine mild, from 10 to 14 moderate, from 15-19 moderately severe, and from 20-27 severe depression. The psychometric properties of the measure are good, notable for test-retest reliability of 0.84 and internal consistency of 0.89 [25] . The Spanish version of this measure, which has comparable psychometric properties (Cronbach α = .89) with the original version, was used in the present study [26] . The optimal cut-off score for diagnosing depression with the Spanish version of this measure has been proposed to be 12 [27] .Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) [28] . It is a seven-item measure that assess the presence and severity of generalized anxiety disorder in adults. Total sum scores from one to four indicate presence of minimal symptoms, from five to nine mild, from 10 to 14 moderate, and greater than 15 severe anxiety. The measure has presented excellent internal consistency (Cronbach α = .92) and good test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation = .83). In the present study, the Spanish version [29] of the measure was used. This version has presented good psychometric properties (Cronbach α = .93, test-retest correlation = 0.92), and 10 has been identified as an optimal cut-off point to detect generalized anxiety disorder as diagnosis.Descriptive statistics were conducted to characterize the sample. Frequencies and percentages were calculated for each sociodemographic variable (gender, age group, education, employment, region and localization) and for each behavior during confinement (maintenance of daily routines, exercising, social contact and time focusing on information about the COVID-19). Mean and standard deviations were calculated for the total scores retrieved from the sum scores of the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7. The scores were coded categorically to express the severity of anxiety and depression, according to the indications presented in the measures section above. Frequencies and percentages were calculated for each severity level. Also, the percentage of participants presenting with both depression and anxiety was calculated. The possible associations between sociodemographic variables and psychological symptoms (total sum scores of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7) were tested through t-test for variables with two levels and analyses of variance (ANOVA) for variables with more than two levels. The same procedure was used to test possible associations between behaviors during the confinement and psychological symptoms. Two-step hierarchical regression analyses were performed to determine the contribution of each variable to GAD-7 and PHQ-9 total sum scores separately. In the first step we included the sociodemographic variables presenting significant differences and in the second step we added the behaviors during the confinement presenting significant differences while controlling for the sociodemographic variables previously identified. All tests were two-tailed, and significance level was set up at p < 0.05. All the statistical analysis were conducted using R [30] . The minimal data set to replicate these analyses is included as supporting information (S1 Dataset).According to the Ecuadorian law and international good clinical and research practices observational studies that do not put in risk patients' rights are exempted to obtain full ethical approval. This study presents a secondary data analysis of Ortiz-Prado et al. 2020 [23] , which received ethical exemption from the Universidad de Las Américas Ethics Committee (CEISH) because it used only anonymized, un-identifiable information of the patients. Follow-up phone calls and the information retrieved was obtained by health professionals who offer standard care treatment for confirmed and suspected patients with COVID-19. The information from those reports were anonymized, ensuring no susceptible information was shared to any member of our research team. All the participants provided informed consent after reading the information for the study and before to start to use the self-reporting tool by clicking in the button ""Accept"".In total, 759 persons in epidemiological surveillance completed the survey, 51.9% were females. The mean age was 37 years (SD = 11.01) ranging from 18 to 94 years. Respondents were from the three main regions in Ecuador: Coastal, Sierra and Amazon. At the moment of data collection, the number of persons under epidemiological surveillance in the Insular region was minimal. Information in detail about sample characteristics can be found in Table 1 .The mean level of anxiety measured by the GAD-7 was 6.2 (SD = 5.15); 41.9% (n = 318) had none or minimal presence of symptoms of anxiety, 35.6% (n = 270) had sum scores indicating mild, 14.6% (n = 111) moderate, and 7.9% (n = 60) severe anxiety. The mean level of depression measured by the PHQ-9 was 5.85 (SD = 5.34); almost half of the participants (47.4%; n = 360) had none or minimal presence of symptoms of depression, 32.3% (n = 245) had sum scores indicating mild, 12.3% (n = 93) moderate, 5.5% (n = 42) moderately severe, and 2.5% (n = 19) severe depression. The last item of the PHQ-9 is an indicator of suicide ideation; 6.6% (n = 50) responded positively to this item, indicating the presence of risk. In total, 9.1% (n = 69) of the participants presented both depression and anxiety classified using the cutoff scores proposed for each measure (PHQ-9 = 12, GAD-7 = 10), indicated in the measures section above.Mean differences of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 sum scores according several sociodemographic variables can be found in Table 1 . The results of the univariate analysis indicated that only gender and region presented statistically significant mean differences for GAD-7 and PHQ-9 sum scores. Males presented lower mean scores of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 than females. For post-hoc analysis of scores according region where patient was living, pairwise comparisons Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) test were used. The results indicated significant differences of GAD-7 total scores of persons from Coastal and the other regions (Coastal vs. Sierra mean difference = -0.86, p = .04; Coastal vs. Amazon mean difference = -1.51, p = .02). No significant mean differences were found of persons from Sierra vs. Amazon region (mean difference = -0.64, p = .35). The same pattern was found for PHQ-9 total scores (Coastal vs. Sierra mean difference = -1.38, p = .001; Coastal vs. Amazon mean difference = -2.28, p = .001; Sierra vs. Amazon mean difference = -0.81, p = .25). Patients from Coastal region presented higher levels of depression and anxiety.Mean differences of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 sum scores according each behavior during the confinement can be found in Table 2 . Significant mean differences were found for the levels of the variables: maintenance of daily routines, exercising and time focusing on information about the COVID-19. Those patients that maintained daily routines presented lower sum scores in GAD-7 and PHQ-9 than those who did not maintain a regular routine. In relation to exercising, those who exercise presented lower symptoms of depression and anxiety than those who did not exercise. For time spent getting information about COVID-19 pairwise comparisons were performed using Fisher's LSD test. The results indicated that those who spent an hour or less with this purpose presented lower sum scores in GAD-7 and PHQ-9 than those who avoid to look information about the topic (GAD-7 sum scores mean difference = 2.45, p < .001; PHQ-9 sum scores mean difference = 2.82, p < .001) and those who spent more than an hour getting information about COVID-19 (t GAD-7 sum scores mean difference = 2.11, p < .001; total PHQ-9 scores mean difference = 1.89, p < .001). No significant mean differences in total were found for those who avoid getting information and those who spent more than an hour getting information (GAD-7 sum scores mean difference = 0.34, p = .49; PHQ-9 sum scores mean difference = 0.92, p = .07).Those variables presenting significant differences in the previous analyses were included in a two-step hierarchical regression analysis as predictors of GAD-7 sum scores and PHQ-9 sum scores separately. Sociodemographic variables were first included in a model, and behavioral ones were subsequently included to observe their contribution to the final model. Region was considered as a dichotomous variable, based on the previous result indicating that persons from Coastal have greater significant scores that the other two regions.In relation to anxiety, in the first step of the regression model gender and region were included as predictors, and the regression model was statistically significant, F (2, 753) = 15.33, p < .001. The model explained 3.9% of the variance. Both variables significantly contributed to the model. In the second step, in which behaviors during the confinement were included in the model (maintaining regular schedule, exercising and time spent getting information about the COVID-19) along with sociodemographic variables, the model was statistically significant, F (6, 749) = 16.58, p < .001, and significantly improved explaining 11.8% of the variance of the GAD-7 total sum scores. The resulting unstandardized coefficients for the hierarchical linear regression analysis for variables predicting GAD-7 total sum scores can be found in Table 3 .In relation to depression, in the first step, the model was statistically significant, F (2, 753) = 21.62, p < .001, age and region significantly contributed to explain depressive symptoms, with the model explaining 5.4% of the variance. In the second step in which variables presenting behaviors during the confinement were added, the model was statistically significant, F (6, 749) = 24.73, p < .001, and accounted for 17% of the variance of the PHQ-9 total sum scores. All the variables significantly contributed to the model. The resulting unstandardized coefficients for the hierarchical linear regression analysis for variables predicting PHQ-9 total sum scores can be found in Table 4 . The current study aimed to characterize the mental health of an Ecuadorian population that was being surveilled epidemiologically by the health department as a result of either being Note.

Results indicated that there is a very high prevalence of persons presenting at least mild symptoms of anxiety (58.1%) and depression (52.6%). Females and patients from Coastal regions presented with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Maintaining a daily routine and spending one hour or less daily seeking information were associated with lower anxiety and depression, while exercising was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety. These results about prevalence of anxiety/depression are higher than those presented by Zhang et al. [12] with a similar population, participants which had a COVID-19 diagnosis or were under mandatory quarantine in China. In that study, 37.4% of the participants endorsed at least mild anxiety and up, while 47.6%, endorsed symptoms of at least mild depression and up. However, when considering the percentage of those endorsing moderate to severe symptoms the percentage presented in Zhang's et al. [12] study was slightly higher than the presented in our study (21.5% vs. 20 .3%). The percentage of participants endorsing moderate to severe anxiety symptoms was higher in our study than in Zhang's et al. [12] study (22.5% vs 14%) . In spite of cultural differences, the number of people presenting emotionally distress during the pandemic for COVID-19 appears to be grossly consistent. This information might prove useful for other countries planning a mental health response to current circumstances, especially taking in consideration the possible long-term mental health effects like chronic depression and PTSD, as it was observed in survivors of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in South Korea [31] .The results of our investigation show that the prevalence found among COVID-19 patients is higher than the reported previously in Ecuador [32] . The Prevalence of major depressive disorders was 6.2% while generalized anxiety and panic disorders ranged from 0.2 to 2.2%. [32] . On the other hand, a recently published study suggest that younger populations are at greater risk of developing depression and anxiety after experiencing a shocking and stressing event as reported in 2020 [33] .The present study also revealed that some sociodemographic variables are associated with higher levels of depression and/or anxiety in patients diagnosed or suspected to have COVID-19. Being woman was associated with both, greater levels of depression and anxiety, and the difference in mean scores approximated two points in both conditions. For reference, a twopoint increase in PHQ-9 or GAD-7 score could move a person from the mild to the moderate range, or from the latter to the severe range. This result is consistent with a study by Liu et al. [34] that found women reported a higher number of cognitive and mood symptoms in a hardest-hit area of China. Another factor associated with levels of depression and anxiety was the area of residence. Participants from Coastal region were more affected emotionally, and this makes sense given the progression of the disease in the country. Coastal areas, particularly Guayaquil, presented a higher number of cases and higher mortality rates in comparison to the other regions during April 2020 as result of the COVID-19 pandemic [23] .This study also found several behaviors associated with better mental health for those diagnosed or suspected to have COVID-19: exercising, maintaining daily routines, and time spent focusing on information about the COVID-19. The relationship between exercise and mental health is well-established in the literature [35, 36] and it is unsurprising to find this association in the current data, though reassuring because it is a modifiable protective factor that can be promoted and easily instantiated during the pandemic. Conversely, a lack of physical activity has been associated with the development of psychological disorders, which underscores the importance of promoting exercise during the pandemic [37] . Likewise, daily routine development and maintenance are a staple of many psychotherapeutic interventions for anxiety and depression, and the negative feelings stemming from isolation and the breakdown of normal routine in quarantine conditions has been documented extensively in the literature [6, 37] . Lastly, the current study found an association between information seeking about COVID-19 and mental health. This is consistent with results from Nguyen et al. [38] who found health literacy was associated with lower levels of depression and higher health-related quality of life in patients who had suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Of note, when analyzing the direct relationship between information seeking and mental health in this study, results showed that maintained informed about the COVID-19 is beneficial, but anything over an average of an hour a day might produce distress. Other studies, have indicated similar associations, in Germany the limit was two hours and a half [15] while in China [9] it was more than three hours. The difference in results might respond to the differences in social and cultural contexts in which studies were conducted and the evolution of the pandemic, however all the results support the fact that the excess of time getting information about the COVID-19 is related with the presence of psychological distress. These results support what has been recommended by the WHO [19] for maintaining mental health during the pandemic, which mentioned that it is essential to minimize the search for information of COVID-19 and focus on information on prevention and self-care practices, additionally, searching from rigorous and authoritative sources and no more than twice a day. Of note, our results indicate that the number of people with whom remote contact is maintained is not associated with psychological distress. Probably, the quality of the contact is a more relevant factor.Regression analysis demonstrated that modifiable behaviors explained a significant amount of variance of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 sum scores when they are controlled by gender and region. That denotes the relevance of those behaviors as possible focus of attention for interventions for people in confinement. Such interventions might be taking care to promote exercising, maintaining daily routines, and inform about COVID-19, but restrict the time focusing on information to an hour or less in surveilled population.This study has limitations. Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study it is no possible to establish causal conclusions, for example, whether symptoms of depression and/or anxiety will remit when the person no longer presents physical signs related with COVID-19 or if previous levels of anxiety and depression in women explain the scores obtained by this group. Furthermore, participants were not asked about premorbid psychiatric disorders and/or personality characteristics that may act as risk factors for the development of anxiety and/or depression in the face of new stressors. Lacking an ability to describe one´s emotional experience and maintain adequate self-regulation, as is the case in alexithymia and sensory processing difficulties, have been found to be associated with depression [39] [40] [41] [42] . Future studies should obtain more information about the existing psychological characteristics of people diagnosed and/or suspected to have COVID-19 in order to ascertain possible relationships with the onset of anxiety/depression. In addition, taking into account that the study was carried out at the beginning of the pandemic and at that time the number of confirmed infected and deaths was still low, the present results represent only a snapshot of the situation of the persons under epidemiological surveillance at the time when the study was conducted. It is likely that the situation changed as the number of infected and confirmed deaths increased. Finally, responses were collected only from those patients who were willing to read the online survey or who were healthy enough to understand and to be able to respond to the online survey tool during follow-up.This study identified behaviors and sociodemographic traits associated with anxiety and depression in a group of participants with either a diagnosis or symptoms of COVID-19 in Ecuador. Being female and living in the Coastal region were associated with higher levels of symptoms of anxiety/depression, but more importantly behaviors like maintaining a routine, information seeking, and exercise were protective factors for poor mental health. This information can help shape public health policy not only by noting which populations are more vulnerable to be negatively affected by COVID-19, but also by suggesting possible strategies to mitigate the psychological effects. Behaviors during a pandemic are modifiable factors susceptible to public health interventions. It is evident that there is need for the implementation of programs to reduce psychological distress in the population under epidemiological surveillance. As suggested by Brooks et al. [6] , this interventions should guarantee basic needs fulfilment, provision of adequate information about the disease and treatment, offering professional mental health support, maintaining communication with the own social network, and promotion of activities to reduce the boredom produced by staying in quarantine.Supporting information S1 Dataset.

8c3080780c7f6b03527445ef99ee44f59d348457,"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the first 557 successive patients with COVID-19 in Pernambuco state, Northeast Brazil","In late December 2019, a cluster of severe pneumonia cases of unknown origin was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1] . The disease, later named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , was caused by a novel coronavirus identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2, 3] . Similar to other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs -SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 belongs to β genus within the Coronaviridae family and emerged from bats.The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 around the world caused the World Health Organization (WHO) to declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [4] . China was the first epicenter of pandemic, followed by Europe, the USA, and now South America. On February 26, 2020, Brazil reported the first case in Latin America in a São Paulo patient returning home after a work trip to Italy from February 9th to 21st. The patient had a mild respiratory disease characterized by coryza, dry cough, and sore throat [5] [6] [7] . Since then, the number of COVID-19 cases in Brazil has increased steadily and the country has become the third most affected in the world after the USA and India. Given the paucity of diagnostic tests in developing countries, the actual incidence of COVID-19 in Brazil is heavily underestimated. For instance, while the USA has done 282,114 tests per million inhabitants, Brazil has performed only 68,143 tests/million people (https://www.worldometers. info/coronavirus/). As of September 15, 2020, Brazil has confirmed 4.3 million COVID-19 cases and 132,297 deaths (https://www.wor ldometers.info/coronavirus/). Pernambuco is one of the most affected state in Brazil with 137.869 cases and 7914 deaths [8] .The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 caused a profound change in the global scenario and recruited public health authorities and research groups from different parts of the world to fill knowledge gaps in the biology and pathogenesis of this devastating pathogen. Although the epidemiological and clinical presentation of COVID-19 has been well documented in several countries of the Northern Hemisphere, information regarding the clinical features of COVID-19 in Latin America, especially in Brazil, remains scarce and limited. Thus, an updated analysis of cases could help to significantly improve our knowledge and consequently provide insights into COVID-19 in this region of the planet, given its unique climate, social dynamics, population genetics and political scenario [9] .Here, we describe for the first time the clinical, epidemiological and demographic features of the first 557 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Pernambuco state, Northeast Brazil, who were diagnosed between March 12 and April 22, 2020.A total of 557 patients living in Pernambuco state with a positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test were included in this study. Patients were considered to have confirmed COVID-19 infection if they had at least one positive RT-qPCR test for SARS-CoV-2. This study was approved by the UPE Institutional Review Board under protocol CAAE: 27607619.0.0000.5207 and was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines e regulations, including the Brazilian National Health Council (CNS) Resolution 466/2012. The requirement for informed consent study was waived based on the nature of this observational retrospective study, in which patient identifying information were kept confidential.Patient epidemiological information, demographic and clinical characteristics, including medical history, signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, underlying co-morbidities, and date of disease onset were obtained from electronic medical records of the Pernambuco Central Public Health Laboratory (LACEN) and analyzed. Patient outcome data were obtained from March 12 to 22 April 2020, the final date of followup.All COVID-19 patients enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance [10] . Laboratory confirmation was performed at the Pernambuco LACEN, which is one of the designated laboratories for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in this state. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from patients presenting respiratory signs of disease compatible with COVID-19. After sample collection, viral RNA was extracted using the ReliaPrep Viral TNA Miniprep System Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), according to the manufacturers' instructions and the RNA was used for RT-qPCR following the protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection established by Corman and coworkers [11] .Spatial analysis were done by georeferencing only the addresses of individuals residing in Recife (n = 306), capital of the State of Pernambuco and city with the largest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the time of this analysis. For that, the QGIS software (https://qgis. org/en/site/) was used to plot home addresses and the Kernel Density Estimation method was applied to identify the neighborhoods with the highest concentration of COVID-19 cases. We also calculated the incidence of infection in the neighborhoods and that concentration of cases were displayed on a heat map. The location of the georeferenced addresses was produced on a scale of 1:215,000, which means that on the map, the location of the addresses presents an error of approximately 0.4 mm (40 m on the real scale). Therefore, the addresses of individuals are located in an area of approximately 2500 m 2 . As Recife is an urbanized city, ethical concerns are not applicable because it is not possible to verify the exact location of each residence. The cartographic base used was acquired in shapefile format at the website of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in the Geocentric Reference System for the Americas (SIRGAS) 2000. In addition, we built a graduated map with information on the income of households in the neighborhoods from the city of Recife and we classified the neighborhoods based on the amount of minimum wages received to correlate the distribution of COVID-19 cases within the different ranges of household income of the studied population. We used data on minimum wages and average monthly nominal income per household from the last Brazilian census (http://censo2010.ibge.gov.br/).Microsoft Office Excel (version 2010) was used to build a database with patient's information. Data process and analysis were made using the GraphPad Prism version 6.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Continuous variables were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges, as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables. Statistically significant differences were defined as p < 0.05.From 12 March to April 22, 2020, a total of 2772 suspected cases-1616 females (58.30%) and 1156 males (41.70%) -were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the Pernambuco LACEN by RT-qPCR. From total cases, 557 (20.09%) were positive for SARS-COV-2. These were the first COVID-19 cases reported in the state. Fig. 1 illustrates the epidemic distribution in Pernambuco state. The highest number of cases (n = 304, 54.58%) occurred in the city of Recife, capital of Pernambuco, followed by the metropolitan cities Jaboatão dos Guararapes (n = 43, 7.72%), Olinda (n = 43, 7.72%), Paulista (n = 30, 5.39%), São Lourenço da Mata (n = 23, 4.13%), and Camaragibe (n = 16, 2.87%).The first 304 cases of COVID-19 in Recife were georeferenced using the Kernal Density Estimate. The highest case numbers were concentrated in the neighborhoods of Casa Amarela, Parnamirim, Rosarinho, Encruzilhada, Espinheiro, Graças, Torre, Madalena, and Boa Viagem (Fig. 1A ). The Rosarinho neighborhood had the highest incidence of COVID-19 (12.26/10 4 inhabitants) and also had the highest number of cases per square kilometer (20/km 2 ), while the Guabiraba neighborhood had the lowest incidence (1.58/10 4 inhabitants) and a lower number of cases per square kilometer (0.02/km 2 ). Regarding the distribution of COVID-19 cases in the different household income ranges (Fig. 1B) , we found that SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred in neighborhoods with greater purchasing power. Of the nine neighborhoods highlighted on the heat map, seven had households with earnings greater than 10 minimum wages, demonstrating that the first COVID-19 cases in Pernambuco target the high income population. Fig. 1A shows the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in Recife, Pernambuco capital as heat map. The Kernel Density Estimate was used to show the areas with the highest concentration of cases associated with the incidence of the disease in some neighborhoods. Fig. 1B shows a graduated map with information on the average nominal monthly household income converted into the amount of minimum wages. Fig. 1C shows the cities with COVID-19 positive cases in the State of Pernambuco.Pernambuco was notified on March 12, 2010. During the first week, 29 (5.20%) cases and 2 (3.38%) deaths were registered. The fourth week (from 7 to 14 April) registered the greatest increase in the number of cases and deaths. A total of 354 (63.55%) cases and 29 (49.15%) deaths were recorded in that period, which corresponded to 501 (89.94%%) accumulated positive cases and 58 (98.30%) deaths.The age of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients ranged from 27 days to 97 years with a mean of 48.57 years and a median of 47 (interquartile range [IQR], 32 to 68). The ratio of males to female in the SARS-CoV-2infected group was 0.83:1 (45.42% males/54.58% females; chi-square test, p = 0.46), showing a slight higher incidence in females than males. The highest number of cases occurred in patients aged 31-40 years old (n = 128, 22.98%), followed by the 41-50 years age group (n = 121, 21.72%), and the group embracing patients from 51 to 60 years old (n = 101, 18.13%). During the study period, a total of 59 deaths occurred. Among these, 51 (86.44%) were patients older than 51 years. Although the incidence was more elevated in females, the number of deaths tended to be higher in males (55.93% versus 44.06%), despite the difference not reaching statistical significance (chi-square test, p = 0.87). The mean age of deceased patients was 66.06 years and the median was 65 (interquartile range, 51.5-82.5). The highest mortality rate was observed in patients in the 61-70 years age group (n = 18, 30.50%), followed by the 51 to 60 age group (n = 11, 18.64%) (Fig. 2B) . Fig. 3A summarizes the main symptoms presented at the time of patient notification. The most common symptom was cough (n = 415, 74.51%), followed by fever (n = 372, 66.79%), dyspnea (n = 312, 56.01%), sore throat (n = 157, 28.19%) and O 2 saturation <95% (N = 136, 24.42%). Some patients also presented myalgia (n = 28, 5.03%), headache (n = 24, 4.31%), running nose (n = 20, 3.59%), diarrhea (n = 17, 3.05%), and vomiting (n = 9, 1.62%). Fig. 3B shows the symptoms according to age groups. The most prevalent symptom in patients aged less than 20 years old were fever, cough and dyspnea. In addition to these symptoms, sore throat, myalgia, headache, diarrhea, vomiting and runny nose were more common in people aged over 20 years old. The highest rate of patients with saturation <95% was found in individuals aged over 61 years. The average time from the symptoms onset to notification date was 4.85 days while among deceased patients this number was 4.52 days.We next sought to investigate the virus shedding pattern in patients at the time of diagnosis. Information on the quantitation cycle (Cq) was available for 388 patients. The Cq value was used to estimate the viral load of patient's nasopharyngeal specimens, in which lower Cq values indicate higher amount of virus. The median Cq of the patients was 26.3 (SD = 5,7) and ranged from 13.3 to 39.3. To evaluate SARS-CoV-2 shedding patterns in this cohort, the data were further stratified according to the day of symptoms onset at the time of sampling. The median time from illness onset to diagnosis was 4.0 days (SD = 4,7), with a range of 0-39 days (Fig. 4A) . We then compared the viral load of severe cases (patients that were admitted to ICU and the ones that have died) with mild cases at different days since symptoms onset (Fig. 4B) . There was no statistically significant difference in viral load at the time of diagnosis of patients with mild or severe COVID-19 up to 14 days of symptoms onset. However, patients with severe disease diagnosed after 14 days of symptoms onset had higher viral load than patients with mild disease (p = 0.0218).The clinical evolution of patients reported up to the date of notification (April 22nd, 2020) indicated that 50.63% (282/557) were in selfisolation, 26.93% (150/557) were in general hospital wards, 5.38% (30/ 557) required intensive care unit (ICU) care, 6.46% (36/557) fully recovered from the disease and 10.59% (59/557) of the patients evolved to death (Table 1) .Information on comorbidities was available to 116 patients. A total of 72.27% of the patients reported comorbidities. The most common comorbidity was arterial hypertension (26.72%), followed by diabetes mellitus (16.38%), cardiovascular diseases (13.79%), asthma (6.89%), lung disease (4.31%), obesity (2.59%), and kidney disease (0.87%) (Fig. 5) . Brazil remains the third most affected country after the USA and India. After its initial detection on February 26, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to all its 26 states and the federal district. Yet, the epidemiological and clinical profile of COVID-19 in Brazil has not been reported in the literature. Here, we described for the first time the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the first 557 consecutive patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 in the state of Pernambuco between 12 March and April 22, 2020. The first patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 in Pernambuco were an elderly couple (71-year-old man and 66-yearold woman) returning from Rome, Italy on 29 February and whose diagnostic was confirmed on 12 March. The couple lived in the Boa Viagem, a high-income neighborhood located in the southern region of the city (Fig. 1) . This couple had returned from a trip to Italy and sought medical treatment on March 5, 2020, when Italy already had 3858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 (WHO). On March 17, Pernambuco reported local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for the first time and since then the number of new cases has increased steadily first in the metropolitan area and then spreading to inland cities. The state capital, Recife had the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the study period. As shown in Fig. 1B , the first SARS-CoV-2 cases were concentrated in neighborhoods with a higher nominal monthly household income, such as the Rosarinho, Espinheiro, and Boa Viagem neighborhoods that had average earnings above 10 Brazilian minimum wages. Our data is in agreement with a study done in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in which the highest rates of COVID-19 were observed in the wealthiest regions [12] .Despite the epidemiological evidence and the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the Boa Viagem neighborhood with subsequent spread mainly to high income neighborhoods, it is not possible to say with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 infections in Pernambuco started from these places. For that, robust phylogeography analyses based on SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences from these patients would be necessary to definitely understand the its transmission dynamics and associate it with clinical and epidemiological data. Nevertheless, individuals with high household income are more likely to take costly international trips and are therefore expose themselves to the risk of acquiring an infection overseas. In fact, the index COVID-19 case in Brazil was diagnosed in São Paulo in patient returning from a trip from Italy. Phylogenetic analyses of the first patients in São Paulo coupled with travel history information confirmed multiple independent importations from Italy and local spread during the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the country [13] . Our results highlights the importance of emerging diseases strengthening programs and preventing people who have traveled to different locations in the world from returning to their countries without undergoing quarantine and testing upon return to their home country.The median age of the patients included in this study was 47 years (IQR 32 to 68), ranging from 27 days to 97 years. However, the median age of deceased patients was 65 years. In our study, only 14 cases (2,51% of total) were reported in patients aged less the 20 years, whereas a large proportion of cases (44,70% of total) were in patients aged 31-50 years old. Lethal cases in this cohort were concentrated in patients older than 51 years, which accounted for 86.44% of total deaths. Our data is in agreement with a study conducted by Guan et al. where the median age of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was 47 years (IQR: 35 to 58) and only 0.9% of patients were under 15 years old [14] . In another study carried out in China, the most affected patients were in the 50-59 years age group, whereas fatal cases were concentrated in the 70-79 years group [15] .In our study, a higher proportion of women sought medical attention upon suspecting of a respiratory disease (58.30% females and 41.70% males) and SARS-CoV-2 positivity was higher in female (54.58%) than males (45.42%). The data is in agreement with 102,646 cases of COVID-19 cases reported in Canada to date, in which 56% occurred in females [16] . This sex discrepancy in our studyt might be due to lifestyle behavior in which women are more likely to seek medical care at the first signs of disease than men. The COVID-19 lethality in this study showed a higher tendency in males than females (55.93% versus 44.06%), although it not reached statistical significance. In general, the men to women ratio of COVID-19 prevalence is the same, but men with COVID-19 tend have higher risk of developing the severe forms of the disease and die from it [17, 18] .We found that cough, fever and dyspnea were the most common symptoms. The main symptoms showed in our study were also reported by others [19] [20] [21] [22] . Wan et al., 2020 demonstrated that fever (88.9%) and cough (76.5%) were also the most common symptoms, however, dyspnea was present in only 13.3% of patients [23] . Gastrointestinal manifestations were less prevalent. Lower frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms is also shown in other studies [14, 20] .The virus shedding pattern in patients at the time of diagnosis was investigated in this study. Our data demonstrated that the median time from symptoms onset to viral RNA shedding was 4 days, ranging from 0 to 39 days. This data is in agreement with a study in Wuhan in which the longest duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days [21] . Comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 load of severe cases with mild cases at different days since symptoms onset did not find a statistically significant difference up to 14 days of symptoms onset, but lately diagnosed patients (after 14 days) had higher viral load than patients with mild disease (p = 0.0218). Recently, Liu and co-workers studied the viral dynamics in mild and severe cases of COVID-19 and found that patients with severe disease had about 60 times higher viral load than that of mild cases [24] , irrespective of the day of symptoms onset.In this cohort, 10.59% of the patients died from COVID-19. The high case-fatality rate may be overestimated in this cohort may be due scarcity of testing in Brazil compared to developed countries. For instance, Brazil has performed only 68,143 tests per million people, whereas this rate in developed countries is over 100 thousand per million inhabitants. As of September 15, 2020, the case-fatality rate of COVID-19 is about 3.15%, with 936,651 deaths and 29,648,872 confirmed cases worldwide (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavir us/). A significant proportion of cases (72.27%) in this cohort reported comorbidities and arterial hypertension was the most common condition associated with COVID-19 infection followed by diabetes mellitus. Our findings is in accordance with a study investigating the first 1000 consecutive patients in New York [25] and also in other regions of the world [26] .SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread in Brazil causing unprecedented challenges to the country's health system. Herein, we described the epidemiological and clinical manifestations of the first 557 successive COVID-19 patients in Pernambuco state, Northeast Brazil. Our study provided important information about the demographics, clinics and epidemiology of COVID-19 in the tropical world and will assist physicians and health officials to face the current pandemics and be better Numbers between parentheses indicate percentage of patients in each age group. prepared to counteract future incursions of highly transmissible respiratory pathogens in the human population.

66b59a41f98fdb82cec94f7473041b7b9df59447,Effects of temperature and humidity on the spread of COVID-19: A systematic review,"Introduction 2019. Faced with the global pandemic of COVID-19, declared by World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 th 2020 [16] , and the need to better understand the seasonal behavior of the virus, our team conducted this systematic review to describe current knowledge about the emergence and replicability of the virus and its association with different weather factors such as temperature and relative humidity. This information could be useful to develop and implement an efficient health information system with public interventions to control the incidence, and to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the world.This systematic review was registered with the PROSPERO database (CRD42020176909) and performed according with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines (S1 Checklist) [17] .Manuscripts that evaluated the effects of different climatic conditions of temperature and/or humidity on the spread of COVID-19 were included. The search strategy was defined based on the PECOS format as follows: The exclusion criteria involved studies that evaluated other upper and lower respiratory tract infections, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV and influenza. The assessment of other climatic conditions, except for temperature and humidity, was also not considered. Opinion articles, animal or laboratory studies, and literature reviews were not included.The following electronic databases were searched: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, LILACS, OpenGrey and Google Scholar. A hand search was also conducted by reading the references list of the included articles. No restriction on language has been applied. Date of publication has been limited to the years 2019 and 2020. The search was conducted up to March 24 th , 2020 in all databases, and until 31 st March, 2020 only in Google Scholar.The electronic searches were performed independently by two authors (P.M. and R.T.R.M.B.). In case of disagreements, a third author (D.N.) was consulted. The search strategy was developed through a combination of MeSHs, Entry Terms and Keywords related to the PECOS strategy using Boolean operators. The full search strategies for each database are illustrated in S1 File.The citations were saved in a reference manager (EndNote, x9 version, Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA). After removing duplicates, titles and abstracts were analyzed according to the eligibility criteria. The selected articles were evaluated by full text, and a final selection was conducted.Two authors collected the data independently (P.M. and R.T.R.M.B.), extracting the following items: authors, year, location and type of study; date of COVID-19 data collection; date of meteorological data collection; sample location; weather variables; COVID-19 data sources; meteorological data sources; statistical analysis and main results. Meta-analysis was planned if there was relative homogeneity of the data and the methods for obtaining it, for each selected article.All the included studies were assessed for methodological rigor using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist tool [18] . The checklist for cross-sectional studies uses eight criteria. The evaluation content includes: the criteria for inclusion in the sample; the study subjects and the setting described; measurement of the exposure; the objective, standard criteria used for measurement of the condition; identifying the confounding factors; the strategies to deal with confounding factors; measurement of the outcomes; and the statistical analysis used. Each component was rated as ""yes"", ""no"", ""unclear"", or ""not applicable"". With 1-3 ""yes"" scores, the risk of bias classification is high, 4-6 ""yes"" scores are moderate and 7-8 are low risk of bias. The information about the studies was extracted, synthesized from the data, and reflected in the results and conclusions of this systematic review. Two authors (P.M. and R.T.R.M.B.) independently evaluated the quality of each study, and disagreements were resolved by discussion within the review team.The included articles were given a narrative GRADE related to the outcomes assessed in this review (effects of temperature and humidity on spread of COVID-19) according to the GRADE tool (Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) (GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool, available online at gradepro.org) [19] . This tool considers five aspects for rating the level of evidence: design, risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision of the studies. The level of evidence was classified as high, moderate, low, or very low. The outcomes evaluated were ""Association between temperature and spread rate of COVID-19"" and ""Association between humidity and spread rate of COVID-19"".The initial searches identified 517 articles: 78 from PubMed, 37 from Scopus, 71 from Web of Science, 2 from Cochrane Library, 4 from LILACS, 0 from OpenGrey and 325 from Google Scholar. After exclusion of duplicates, 434 studies remained. After reading the titles and abstracts, 26 remaining articles were evaluated by full text and 9 were excluded. The reasons for exclusion are shown in Table 1 . Seventeen studies were included and selected for qualitative analysis of risk of bias (Fig 1) [9, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .The characteristics of the included studies are described in Table 2 . All of them were retrospective observational studies that associated weather variables (temperature and humidity) with the spread of COVID-19 [9, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Only two studies were also classified as prospective, as they both suggest future policies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through additional control with a new vaccine [25] , and the use of the best fitted predictive model of the climatic conditions of the next 12 days in 5 cities worldwide [24] . Two papers investigated the effect of temperature only on seasonal variability in transmission of COVID-19 [21, 30] . Fifteen articles evaluated the effect of the variables under study-temperature associated with humidity-in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [9, 20, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . It is important to highlight that two studies did not specify the type of humidity evaluated [27, 33] , while 10 studies assess the relative humidity [20, 23-26, 29, 31, 32, 34, 35] , four evaluated the absolute humidity [23, 26, 28, 29] , one evaluated the mean humidity [22] and one evaluated the specific humidity [29] . Six studies evaluated another constant variable [20, 23-25, 27, 32] , not included in this systematic review, that did not demonstrate an important factor if modeled alone in the transmission of the virus, the wind speed. It was not the objective of this systematic review to verify or discuss the statistical parameters in the manuscript. Therefore, we decided to perform a descriptive synthesis, associated with the risk of bias analysis and a narrative GRADE of evidence of the results.Great heterogeneity was observed in relation to the displayed variables, that included other weather conditions beyond temperature and humidity [20, 23-25, 27, 32] like wind speed [20, 23-25, 27, 32] , visibility [24] , precipitation [25, 27] , pressure [20] , rainfall rate [20] , snowfall rate [20] , snow depth [20] , surface downward short-wave irradiation [20] . A heterogeneity was also observed regarding the date of data collection, both in relation to the location studied, and the date of epidemiological data collection of COVID-19 and climatic conditions.Great homogeneity was observed in the results of the effect of temperature and humidity in the seasonal variability and spread of the virus. Sixteen articles selected for final analysis were unanimous in stating that cool and dry conditions were potentiating factors for the spread of COVID-19 [9, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [33] [34] [35] , with the spread being largely absent under extremely cold and very hot and wet conditions. Only one article reported no strong effect of temperature and humidity in the spread of the virus, nevertheless, the statistical analysis of this study was inadequate, compromising its conclusion [32] .It was also noticed that several meteorological factors combined could better describe the epidemic trend than when a single variable was analyzed [21, 24] . In addition, confounding factors as public health policies on surveillance and containment, social isolation campaigns (home quarantine strategy), including with patients' families, socio-economic development contributes to controlling the spread of the virus around the world [9, 20, 23-29, 31, 33, 35] . Effects of temperature and humidity on the spread of COVID-19: a systematic review Effects of temperature and humidity on the spread of COVID-19: a systematic review Effects of temperature and humidity on the spread of COVID-19: a systematic review Moreover, controlling population density (less crowded cities) [31] and movement [24] , travel limitations [26, 28] , increasing the number of medical staff and hospitals, isolating all the suspected cases, understanding the method of each patient's infection, combining the medical history of the patients with current diagnosis to extract information about the virus [20] , are important measures to combat the new coronavirus. It was verified, in countries with virus transmission under control like Korea, that the widespread testing to identify potential COVID-19 positive subjects, including asymptomatic ones, could reduce transmission [23] .Regarding the review process, sixteen of the selected articles have not yet gone through the peer review process. This must be taken into consideration when making any inference from their conclusion [9, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .After considering all these factors, we can infer that confounding variables (like population density, purchasing power [31] , public health interventions [28] , containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation, cultural aspects [27] ) play an important and significant role in the spread of COVID-19.A meta-analysis was not performed due to the heterogeneity of the methods, locations, and information provided in the related articles investigating the proposed objectives. Additionally, differing units of measure, variables and statistical methods did not allow meaningful comparisons. Only simple and descriptive comparisons were reported, beyond the risk of bias and narrative GRADE of evidence of the results.The risk of bias in two included studies was classified as high [22, 32] , eleven articles showed a moderate risk of bias [9, 20, 21, 23-27, 29, 30, 34] , and four showed a low risk of bias (Table 3 ) [28, 31, 33, 35] . The questions that received more ""no"" answers, indicating study limitations, were: ""Were confounding factors identified?"" [9, 20-24, 26, 29, 30, 32, 34, 35] ; ""Were strategies to deal with confounding factors stated?"" [9, 20-26, 29, 30, 32, 34, 35] ; ""Was appropriate statistical analysis used?"" [9, 20, 22, 23, 25, 29, 32] . Other less frequent problems were observed in the questions: ""Were the criteria for inclusion in the sample clearly defined?"" [21] ; ""Was the exposure measured in a valid and reliable way?"" [22, 27] ; ""Were objective, standard criteria used for measurement of the condition?"" [20, 27, 32] ; ""Were the outcomes measured in a valid and reliable way?"" [9, 22, 27, 32] .The evaluation of the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE is described in Table 4 . The level of certainty of outcomes evaluated in this systematic review-""Association between temperature and spread rate of COVID-19"" and ""Association between humidity and spread rate of COVID-19""-were classified as ""low"". Since the studies are observational and presented a considerable risk of bias in some criteria assessed, the certainty of the evidence several studies did not consider variables such as migration patterns and isolation policies in their results generated received this classification. Moreover, one study did not show a significant effect of the variables under study on the spread of the new coronavirus [32] . Mod.Mod.The results of the articles included in this systematic review indicate that the spread of COVID-19 may be influenced by climatic variables such as temperature and humidity. Apparently, warmer and humid climates may show less transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although the certainty of evidence generated was low, due to the observational design of the studies and the inherent risk of bias, overall great homogeneity of the results was observed among the included studies. Furthermore, the spread of types of diseases caused by betacoronavirus, such as SARS--CoV-1 [11] and MERS-CoV [36] , have already been shown to suffer the impact of climatic conditions. In both these coronoviruses, hot and humid climates demonstrated the ability to decrease the viability of these viruses, while in places with low temperature and humidity there was greater viral stability. The favorable cold and dry weather conditions facilitates the spread of the coronaviruses and seems to be the same for SARS-CoV-2 virus, as it was observed homogeneously in the included papers.Seventeen articles were included in this systematic review, and methodological issues were identified [9, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Regarding the classification of the articles and their score evaluated by the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist tool [18] , two studies were classified as high risk of bias Association between temperature and spread rate of COVID-19Of the seventeen articles evaluated, sixteen showed some effect of temperature on the transmission rate. Except for one, which concluded that temperature has no effect on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the other sixteen found that warmer climates are less likely to spread the virus. Studies with more robust statistical analysis, which used multivariate tests, showed that variables such as migration patterns, public isolation policies, population density, and cultural aspects, the temperature seems to have less impact.Association between humidity and spread rate of COVID-19Fourteen manuscripts that investigated the effect of humidity on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated an association between variables. Only one article reported no effect of humidity on the spread of the virus, while the other fourteen showed that wetter climates inhibit the virus spread. As with the temperature, studies with more robust statistical analysis, which used multivariate tests, showed that the adjustment for confounding factors decreases the impact of humidity on the transmission of COVID-19. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238339.t004 [22, 32] , eleven articles showed a moderate risk of bias [9, 20, 21, 23-27, 29, 30, 34] , and four a low risk of bias [28, 31, 33, 35] . This was due, especially, to limitations in the ""identification of the confounding factors"" that could interfere with the final analysis of the included articles. These many confounder weather variables, associated with public health policy, are the major limitations of this systematic review, as a simple correlation statistic design cannot be done in order to establish a direct cause-effect relationship of temperature and humidity in the spread of the new coronavirus, which implied in the negative classification of the item ""the statistical analysis used"". The items ""the criteria for inclusion in the sample"" and ""the study subjects and the setting described"", both related to sample selection criteria, received a positive rating in almost all selected articles. A reasonable explanation for this fact would be that due to the urgency of the world situation with the rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide and the need to search for immediate responses to contain the pandemic, secondary well-founded data available was used at the moment that the studies were realized, both in relation to the epidemiology of the new coronavirus, and to the climatic conditions, in an attempt to verify a possible association between them. Finally, even considering that the search period on electronical databases were performed before the outbreak in some countries, the results can be extrapolated for the spread characteristics of COVID-19 around the world. A possible search bias did not influence negatively the results, that remained consistent and homogeneous with the most recent data [37] . The certainty of evidence of clinical outcomes was also graded using the GRADE tool [19] . The evidence was scored as low because of the study designs, classified as observational crosssectional studies [9, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , due to the effect of other confounding variables on temperature and humidity in the spread of the virus, which are not identified in some studies [9, 20-24, 26, 29, 30, 32, 34, 35] , and because one selected article did not find a positive strong association between the spread of the new coronavirus with temperature and humidity [32] . One of the main limitations of this study was the use of a simple correlation in its statistical analysis, which does not allow the establishment of a cause and effect relationship between the studied variables [32] . However, due to homogeneity in the results, which indicate, in summary, that cool and dry conditions were potential factors to the spread of COVID-19, and warmer and wetter climates are less likely to enhance the transmissibility of the virus, the certainty of evidence could not be rated lower than that.The analyses of COVID-19 outbreaks in relation to meteorology aspects reveal significant connection between the incidence of positive cases and climatic conditions. Social factors in combination with meteorological factors play a role in coronavirus outbreaks, since this public health problem is too complex to be explained solely in relation of climatic conditions. Isolation programs, social distancing, number of inhabitants per household, immigration control program, personal hygiene conditions are some of the confounding variables that must interfere in the spread of the new coronavirus, as it occurs with another coronaviruses in the past [38, 39] . Studies that have explored the role of temperature and humidity on the global spread of the disease are expected to take into account public policies, as these measures must be rapidly implemented as an emergency basis of this public health problem, especially to vulnerable countries [40, 41] .In fifteen included studies [9, 20, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , the authors investigate the association between temperature and humidity in the transmission rate of COVID-19. In the other two articles [21, 30] , the association was made only with temperature. Although humidity has been measured in different ways, like relative and absolute, the great majority of the included studies indicate that there is a relationship between this variable and the spread of the virus.Luo et al. suggested that sustained transmission and rapid (exponential) growth of cases are possible over a range of humidity and temperature conditions, associated with lack of extensive public health interventions, especially in most social and climatic vulnerable countries [26] . Bu et al. concluded that a temperature range of 13~19˚C and humidity of 50%8 0% are suitable for the survival and transmission of COVID-19 [22] . Moreover, Wang et al. have support the role that temperature could have in changing the COVID-19 human-tohuman transmission and that there might be an optimal temperature for the viral transmission [30] . They suggested that colder regions in the world should adopt the strictest social control measures, since low temperatures significantly contribute to the viability, transmission rate and survival of coronaviruses. Even if the collected data of the study was taken before the outbreak in China, the authors' results would be extrapolated to the present days and directly interfere the association of temperature and humidity and the public policy in the spread of COVID-19 [22] . Finally, Kathabbi et al. stated that by air quality analysis in areas highly contaminated by the virus, the population could be informed and be encouraged to avoid this area, creating a microclimate that helps to eliminate the spread of COVID-19 [34] .Araújo et al. made it clear that it is not possible to characterize the exact local temperature and humidity conditions that minimizing the virus spread [9] . On the contrary, it is reasonable to determine the type of macroclimate conditions in the places where transmission is occurring. For example, in the tropics, where high temperatures and humidity characterize the weather, the climatic suitability for spread of COVID-19 seems to be more difficult. Heat intolerance of the virus is probably related to the breakdown of their lipid bilayer [42] , in a similar model to what occurs with the predecessor of the new coronavirus, the SARS-CoV [43] . Speculative explanation also based on patterns observed for other SARS-CoV justifies the effect of humidity on the less effective spread of the virus on the environment, which reduces the total indirect and secondary transmission [44] . Although higher humidity may increase the atmospheric suspended matter [22] , the amount of virus deposited on surfaces, and virus survival time in droplets on surfaces [44] , the reduction of the virus spread by indirect air transmission may be an important factor behind the reduced spreading of COVID-19 in a humid climate.High temperature and high humidity reduce the transmission of others infections of the respiratory tract, like influenza [45, 46] and of SARS coronavirus [11, 39] . The main reasons are: the virus is more stable in cold temperatures, and respiratory droplets, as containers of viruses, remain in suspension longer in dry air [47] . Cold and dry weather can also demote the hosts' immunity and make them more susceptible to the virus [48] .Many respiratory pathogens show seasonality and the human activity patterns and immunity can be influenced by environmental factors limited during the COVID-19 outbreak, due to the absence of extreme climatic conditions and specific immunity for a newly emerging virus [35] . Cold air temperature contributes to spread of viruses, including coronavirus, and the possibility of infection. Some possible reasons are: low temperature provides suitable survival and reproduction conditions for coronavirus [49] ; cold air causes vasoconstriction of the respiratory tract which contributes to weakening of the immune system; and dry cold air makes the nasal mucosa prone to small ruptures, thereby creating opportunities for virus invasion [50] . In contrast, a long period of low or extremely cold temperature played a positive role in reducing the transmission of the coronavirus [9, 22] .In addition, Bukhari et al. discuss another hypothesis for the lower number of COVID-19 cases detected in the tropics [23] . It could be due to less mass testing as many of the underdeveloped countries that presents deficiency in the health care system and may have not done enough testing to detect the actual spread of this virus.Two of the articles were classified as retrospective and prospective [24, 25] , since they suggest implementing future public policies and mass actions that aim to control the spread of COVID-19 around the world. Chen et al. proposed a daily predictive model that in combination with weather observations in the previous 14 days, for five high-latitude cities (New York, Toronto, Italy, Paris and Cologne), is able to predict daily new case counts of COVID-19 for the following 12 days in these places [24] . It is important to notice that a single weather factor alone could not affect the virus transmission too much. However, the combination of different meteorological variables could fit a more complex model, in order to address the systematic influence of different types of weather data on the spread of the virus. Jiwei et al. verified further control with specific medicines and an effective vaccine. Considering the practice of social isolation, the process of this strategy is considered a short-time vaccine for susceptible populations in helping to control the disease [25] .According to Oliveiros et al., temperature and humidity contribute to a maximum of 18% of the variation, the remaining 82% being related to other factors such as containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation, and cultural aspects [27] . Population migration is another key factor in the spread process that cannot be ignored [25] , as well as community structure, social dynamics, and global connectivity [23] . In cities with higher levels of population density, the virus is expected to spread faster than that in less crowded cities [31] .Al-Rousan et al. suggested that international governments should adopt rigorous public policies. This can be done by increasing the number of health professionals and hospitals, and socially isolating, mainly the suspected cases [20] . Better health care facilities tend to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 [31] . The relatively fast outbreak, associated with imperfect daily reporting practices, make a vast underreporting of new cases of COVID-19. Travel limitations and other control interventions need to be implemented consistently [28] . Additionally, Gupta recommended that all citizens be required to wear a face mask whenever they go out, because the primarily viral infection is through airborne or close contact. The Chinese government used this as a key tool in managing the disease, especially with asymptomatic infected people [33] .Finally, the review process of the selected articles should be evaluated with caution. Sixteen of the included studies in this systematic review have not yet gone through the peer review process, which must be taken into consideration when making any inference from the authors' conclusion [9, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .The results of this systematic review indicate that the confounding variables, together, are even more significant than temperature and relative humidity. The timing, implementation, and magnitude of the likely public interventions from international governments should reduce the adverse consequences of COVID-19 on the public health system. Additionally, it is of great value to the society the knowledge about the lowest rate of transmission of the virus in hot and humid weather and the need of more consistent social isolation in cold and dry weather countries, while there is no treatment protocol established by WHO, as well as the vaccine for COVID-19. The arrival of summer in Europe and in the northern hemisphere are interesting points to consider when loosening slowly the isolation policies. Only with proper planning, unnecessary damage will be avoided for individuals and for the global economy.The identification of confounding variables and their association with the public health policies were an important limitation of this systematic review. Some studies [9, 20-24, 26, 29, 30, 32, 34, 35] have not evaluated these factors that could influence the impact of climatic variables on the spread of COVID-19, such as migration patterns, containment measures, general health policies, population density, herd immunity, transportation, and cultural aspects. The articles that included these variables in their analysis [25, 27, 28, 31, 33] concluded that climate alone does not explain most of the variability in the spread of the disease. The simple correlation statistical design employed in many articles was not appropriate, which impacted negatively on the classification of risk of bias and certainty of evidence [9, 20, 22, 23, 25, 29, 32] . Furthermore, the selected studies included less than four months of data in their analyzes, not including the main effects in the United States and Europe. However, once again we emphasize the almost unanimity of the conclusions among the included studies, indicating a more modest role of temperature and humidity on the spread of the virus. In addition, several manuscripts did not go through peer review [9, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , due to the urgency of publication on the topic, so care should be taken when considering the results of these studies, although they point in the same direction of effect and impact. Finally, since it does not fit the eligibility criteria adopted to conduct this study, the effect of temperature and humidity on the rate of quantitative and qualitative progression of the pandemic could not be estimated, especially when considering the arrival of summer in the countries of Europe and in the northern hemisphere.Based on a low level of evidence, the spread of COVID-19 seems to be lower in warm and wet climates. Furthermore, temperature and humidity alone do not explain most of the variability of the COVID-19 outbreak. Public isolation policies, herd immunity, migration patterns, population density, and cultural aspects might directly influence how the spread of this disease occurs. Thus, weather conditions associated with the health policies is a knowledge of great value for the benefit of the humanity in this critical period. ",Brazil,first author,2020-09-18,9
629cedc07e5b2c5e17fd8124c6bad5663e6031c9,Journal Pre-proofs Fabry Diseas Patients Have An Increased Risk Of Stroke In The COVID-19 ERA. A Hypothesis FABRY DISEAS PATIENTS HAVE AN INCREASED RISK OF STROKE IN THE COVID-19 ERA. A HYPOTHESIS,"Fabry disease (FD) (MIM 301500) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by decreased or absent activity of the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A (α-GAL A) (EC:3.2. 1.22) . Stroke is a severe complication of this disease. The prevalence of cerebrovascular disease in FD patients identified in the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS), was 11% in males and 15% in females, a prevalence 12 times higher than that observed in a comparable non-Fabry population. 1 In the global Fabry Registry, 6.9% of males and 4.3% of females with FD had an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.Furthermore, 50% of males and 38% of females suffered their stroke before the diagnosis of FD was made. 2 Moreover, FD has been identified as an under diagnosed etiology of stroke in the young [3] [4] [5] Among patients with FD and no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), 44% of adults and 15.9% of adolescents had silent brain infarcts on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 6, 7 The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is the third coronavirus outbreak in the past twenty years, preceded by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The disease is caused by a member of the Coronaviridae family, defined as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is considered the worst pandemic of modern times 8-10 . Stroke is emerging as a severe complication of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been identified in 2.3% to 22% of patients with COVID infections and is associated with a ～ 2.5 fold increased disease severity 11 . Moreover stroke may be the first clinical manifestation of COVID-19 infection even in young patients lacking cardiovascular risk factors. 12The pathophysiologic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to stroke 13, 14 overlap with those of FD 15,16 . and therefore we hypothesize that there is an increased risk of stroke in patients with FD infected with Covid-19.There are 4 different pathophysiology mechanisms enhancing the risk of stroke in COVID-19 patients that overlap with those of FD including: renin angiotensin aldosterone imbalance, vasculopathy, thromboinflammation and cardiac damage:1. ACE2 Receptor Depletion and Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Imbalance in COVID-19 infection 17, 18 In the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system, angiotensin (Ang) I is converted to Ang II by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II induces vasoconstriction as well as proinflammatory and pro-oxidative effects leading to endothelial dysfunction and activation as defined by the endothelial expression of cellsurface adhesion molecules, mediated by Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor. ACE2 converts Ang II to Ang 1-7, which binds to both: Mas and MrgD receptors and induces opposite actions to the ACE/AngII/AT1 axis. 19 A dysregulated RAA system is considered an important mechanism in the vasculopathy induced by COVID-19. 17, 20 The coronaviral genome encodes four major structural proteins: the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and the envelope (E) protein. The S protein is responsible for facilitating entry of the CoV into the target cell. The entry receptor utilized by SARS-CoV-2 is ACE2. 13,17 ACE2 is a membrane-associated aminopeptidase expressed in vascular endothelia, renal and cardiovascular tissues, and epithelia of the lung, small intestine and testes. A region of the extracellular portion of ACE2 that includes the first α-helix interacts with the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-1 and 2 viruses deplete ACE2 through receptor endocytosis upon viral entry, leaving ACE1 unopposed with generation of angiotensin II. 14,17, 18 Angiotensin II not only worsens lung injury but also induces endothelial dysfunction and activation in organs like the heart and brain 9 . Similarly to COVID-19 infection an upregulated RAA system with enhanced AT1 activity has also been proposed as one of the main mechanisms for endothelial dysfunction and damage in FD leading to vasculopathy and stroke 16 2. Vasculopathy : Endothelial dysfunction, activation and endothelitisEndothelial dysfunction is characterized by impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation due to decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Endothelial inflammation and oxidative stress are well established mechanisms leading to endothelial dysfunction 21, 22 ANG II through AT1 receptor stimulate the catalytic subunit of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases, , producing superoxide, H2O2 and loss of NO bioavailability. NO exerts a host of beneficial effects on the endothelium including regulation of cell survival and apoptosis, regulation of vascular tone and activation of antithrombogenic and anti-inflammatory pathways. NO can be rapidly sequestered by superoxide and converted into a long-lived, toxic reactive compound:peroxynitrite. 17, 18 These mechanisms seem to be common to both Covid-19 infection and FD.In FD there is evidence of increased ROS and deposition of 3-nitrotyrosine staining in dermal and cerebral blood vessels; a process that can be reverted by enzyme replacement. 23 Moreover, cortex homogenates exposed to GB3 showed an increase in the formation of reactive species by the presence of GB3. 24 Excess amounts of ROS may explain the increased resting regional cerebral blood flow identified in FD. 25, 26 In addition mitochondrial dysfunction, further increasing ROS generation, occur in both:Covid-19 infected patients 19 Endothelial cell activation as defined by the endothelial expression of cell-surface adhesion molecules, including VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin is induced by proinflammatory cytokines as seen in both: Covid-19 infected patients and FD (see below) and stimulates the recruitment and attachment of circulating leukocytes to the vessel wall. 21 Cell activation induces eNOS uncoupling, reduces NO synthesis and increases ROS production further enhancing endothelial activation. Moreover, NO benefits, that are lost, include inhibition of platelet reactivity and prevention of smooth muscle cell proliferation 21, 28 Expression of adhesion molecules in FD was analyzed both in endothelial cells and in leukocytes. A Fabry vascular endothelial cell line exposed to Gb3 overexpressed ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin. 29 Moreover, an increased level of surface expression of CD11b and CD18 on monocytes 30 as well as CD31 in T cells, monocytes and granulocytes was observed 31 inducing leucocyte adhesion to the vessel wall and inflammatory infiltration of leucocytes into tissues. 31, 33 Moreover in Covid-19 infected patients: postmortem studies confirmed viral endothelial inclusions and endothelial inflammation with evidence of endothelial and inflammatory cell death. 34 This damage is of particular relevance for patients with preexisting endothelial dysfunction including those with cardiovascular disease and risk factors including Fabry patients.The activation of inflammation and a hypercoagulable state are common mechanisms in The excessive and acute activated immune response seems to be due to pathogenic granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)+Th1 cells and inflammatory CD14+ CD16+ monocytes. 37 These activated cells are critical in neuro inflammation 38 and amplify the recruitment of immune mediators leading to hyperinflammation and a ""cytokine storm"". [35] [36] [37] Moreover, the lymphopenia, affecting patients with COVID-19, markedly reduces the immune modulating effect over the inflammatory process. [35] [36] [37] [38] Accumulated glycolipids in FD, Gb3 and LysoGb3, are recognized as damage signals by toll like receptor 4 leading to overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines.constitutively produce and secrete IL1bβ and TNFα and leukocytes infiltrate the tissues leading to fibrosis 39 40 It is likely that the inflammatory mechanisms induced by the acute immune activation resulting from COVID-19 infection, might enhance and aggravate that of FD and vice versa damaging not only the lungs but also the heart, kidney and brain, the 3 most severely damaged organs in FD.There is an association between systemic infection and stroke even in the absence of cardiovascular risk factors. 41 Bacterial or viral infections may increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease facilitating both: cardiac and arterio-arterial embolism 41.42 A large number of viruses are associated with thrombotic complications in humans (43) SARS COV 1 and SARS COV 2 had also been associated with thrombotic events. 13, 44, 45 The stimulation of an inflammatory response is thought to be the predominant mechanism linking ischemic stroke with infection. [46] [47] [48] Inflammatory cascades promote plaque rupture, and thrombosis, leading to ischemic stroke. The enhanced inflammatory profile induces also a prothrombotic state mediated by attraction of macrophages, and white blood cells, activation of platelets and coagulation factors inhibition of fibrinolysis and complement deposition. The interaction between all these elements induces cloth formation in a process known as thromboinflammation or sepsis induced coagulopathy. 14,17 There is also a recognized association between viral infections and antiphospholipid antibodies production. 49 Antiphospholipid antibodies were reported both in COVID-19 50 and FD patients 51 associated with both arterial and venous thrombotic events.Hypercoagulability in COVID infected patients may even precede severe respiratory illness. 52 Autopsy findings have indicated thrombotic microangiopathy in multiple organs and mild thrombocytopenia high D-dimer and increased fibrinogen levels are associated with a more severe disease or death. 53-,58 The end result of the infection induced systemic inflammatory response combined with endothelial dysfunction and microthrombosis is diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC). Severe cardiac involvement is a relevant feature common to both disorders: Covid-19 infected patients and FD, predisposing to cardioembolic stroke or sudden death. The pathophysiology of cardiac injury due to SARS-COV-2 combines increased cardiac stress due to respiratory failure and hypoxemia, direct viral myocardial infections, the previously described systemic inflammatory response and a combination of all these mechanisms. 67 Cardiac involvement manifested by biomarkers elevations, is not only a frequent finding but also a feature associated with worse prognosis in COVID infected patients.ICU admission and mortality correlate with increased levels of troponin I and brain type natriuretic peptide. [68] [69] [70] Up to 17% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients suffered an acute myocardial injury manifested as acute myocarditis or damage secondary to hypoxemia. 71 Myocarditis is due to a combination of direct viral infection 72 and inflammatory cell infiltration 73 that leads to cardiac failure and sudden death. 68, 74 Arrhythmia associated to SARS-CoV-2 including atrial fibrillation, conduction block, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation was observed in 7% of patients who did not require ICU admission and in 44% of patients who were admitted to ICU. 75 Cardiac involvement in FD is the main cause of death. 76 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a hallmark of FD and evolves into a myocardial replacement fibrosis. 77 Lysosomal dysfunction triggers a cascade of events, including cellular death, inflammation, small vessel injury, oxidative stress, and tissue ischemia responsible for the cardiac damage [78] [79] [80] The end diastolic volume of the left ventricle decreases with progression of the disease, diastolic filling is impaired, resulting in a reduction of stroke volume and cardiac output. 78, 80 The conduction system is severely affected and implantable loop recordings ",Argentina,first author,2020-09-17,9

In a matter of a few months, the disease overtook 80 thousand reported cases until early April, 2020. On March 12nd, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic disease, when more than 20 thousand cases and almost a thousand deaths were registered in the European Region -the center of this pandemic 10 according to the Europe's Standing Committee (WHO, 2020) .There are still many unknowns about COVID-19 and the lack of evidence complicates the design of appropriate response policies -for example, it is impossible to precisely say something about the mortality rate and determine the disease recurrence rate (Lenzer, 2020) . 15 Despite uncertainties, the frightening speed through which this disease spreads across communities and the collapse that it is capable of causing to the health systems are facts that must be faced. The exponential growth of the cases and the consequent number of deaths had been observed in a short period. In mid-January 2020, a few weeks after the first detected COVID-19 case in the world, 20 the countries that are close to the territory of the virus origin, on the Asian continent, as well in European and American Regions also began to report cases of the disease. Five months later, more than 200 countries and territories around the world have reported over to 3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and a death toll of about 200 thousand people. 25 In Brazil, the first confirmed COVID-19 case occurred on February 25th, 2020. This first case was a 61 years-old male, who stayed from February 9th to February 20th, 2020 in Lombardy -an Italian region were a significant outbreak was ongoing at that time. On March 17th, the health authorities in São Paulo confirmed the Brazilian death from the new coronavirus. The victim, whose 30 2 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f identity has not been disclosed, had been hospitalized in São Paulo city.Preserving due proportions, COVID-19 is not the first experienced significant outbreaks of infections that were declared Public Health Emergencies of International Concern by the WHO.Year after year we also have experimented with the Zika and Chikungunya outbreaks in the last decade and continue facing 35 the huge consequences of dengue. Confronting outbreaks in the large Brazilian territory is a twofold problem. The first is the demographic and territorial size of the country, with an estimated population of 210 million according to the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics and the heterogeneity intrinsic to its extensive territory. Another problem pointed out by the past epidemics 40 run into a recurring problem of under-reporting (de Oliveira et al., 2017; Stoner et al., 2019) .The COVID-19, given its complexity and behavior, exposed the problem of under-reporting disease occurrence not only in Brazil but in several countries worldwide. As a consequence, the lack of information has launched a warning 45 about the researchers of the world concerning models and estimates, since the database available may not be reliable from what had indeed been observed.Focusing on the modeling and estimating, aiming to preview the behavior and the speed of the COVID-19 growth, this paper presents an approach to address the problem of under-registration of COVID-19 cases in Brazil, proposing 50 methodologies to work on the inaccuracy of the official reported cases. Then, we investigate a general framework for correcting under-reporting data making it possible to perform a model, in a Bayesian framework, which allows great flexibility and leads to complete predictive distributions for the true counts, therefore quantifying the uncertainty in correcting the under-reporting. Several 55 scenarios of under-reporting were considered in a simulation study, presenting the real lack of data impact. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology for estimating the reported rates. In Section 3, we introduce the SIR model for modeling epidemics. In Section 4, we introduce the Bayesian framework for the 60 SIR model with a modification to account for under-reporting. In Section 5 we 3 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f show the model application for COVID-19 cases in Brazil and in Section 6, we present a simulation study of the proposed model. Finally, in Section 7, we give some concluding remarks.Although in the first moment there was a real hunt for the size and the moment of the COVID-19 cases peak, the most important aspects of the outbreak are the growth rate of the infection. Statistical and mathematical models are being used to preview the rates and analyze the growth curve behavior to assist health public managers in decision-making (Cotta et al., 2020) .According to Kim et al. (2020) , estimating the case fatality rate (CFR) is a high priority in response to this pandemic. This fatality rate is the proportion of deaths among all confirmed patients with the disease, which has been used to assess and compare the severity of the epidemic between countries. The rates can also be used to assess the healthcare capacity in response to the outbreak. Faced with the lack of COVID-19 tests, which naturally leads to the under-90 4 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reporting data, before any modeling purpose we have the desire to correct and update the current numbers, bringing them as close as possible to reality.Following Russel et al. (2020) , we also based on a delay-adjusted case fatality ratio to estimate under-reporting, using the incidence of cases and deaths to estimate the number of notified cases bywhere c t is the daily incidence of cases at the moment t, f j is the proportion of cases with a delay between the confirmation and the death, and µ t represents the underestimation proportion of cases with known outcomes, (Nishiura et al., 95 2009).Then, the corrected CFR is given bywhere m t is the cumulative number of deaths.To estimate the potential for under-reporting, we assume that the CFR is 1.4% with a 95% confidence interval from 1.2% up to 1.7% found in China (Guan W-j, 2020) . Thus, the potential for reporting rate is given by(3)Epidemic models are tools widely used to study the mechanisms by which diseases spread, to predict the course of an outbreak, and to evaluate strate-100 gies to control an epidemic disease. Several analyses of an epidemic spreading disease can be found in the literature that applies the time series model (given the historical data), the log-logistic family of models (the Chapman, Richards, among others), and compartments models (Bjørnstad, 2018) .J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Kermack & McKendrick (1927) proposed a class of compartmental mod-105 els that simplified the mathematical modeling of infectious disease transmission. Entitled as SIR model, it is a set of general equations which explains the dynamics of an infectious disease spreading through a susceptible population.Essentially, the standard SIR model is a set of differential equations that can suit the Susceptible (if previously unexposed to the pathogen), Infected (if cur-110 rently colonized by the pathogen), and Removed (either by death or recovery) as follows:where S, I and R are the total number of susceptible, infected and removed individuals in the population, respectively, γ is the removal rate and β is the infectious contact rate.If we are interested in investigating the unknown number of infected individuals at the moment t in an under-reporting scenario, one can establish the following relationwhere η is as given in (3) and c t is as given in (1).It is important to note thatand so, the total population, S(t) + I(t) + R(t) remains constant for all t ≥ 0.For the practical point of view, the most interesting issue is to estimate 1 γ , which determines the average infection period, and the basic reproductive ratio R 0 . For the simple SIR model, all individuals in the population are susceptible, 120 that is, S(t) = 1, then R 0 is defined as the expected number of secondary 6 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infections from a single index case and given by the expression R 0 = β γ (Keeling & Rohani, 2011) .The Bayesian methods are used in several works (Gelman et al., 1995) ; 125 (Paulino et al., 2018) . The Bayesian approach in the context of the SIR model is a flexible way to account for uncertainty in the parameters, in the form of the disease transmission dynamic. The Dirichlet-Beta state-space model appears in some papers as Osthus et al. (2017) and Song et al. (2020) . The target distribution for inference is the a posteriori distribution of the quantities of interest, 130 more specifically β, γ, and R 0 : the infectious contact rate, the removal rate, and the propagation rate, respectively. The application of this methodology is through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) through Gibbs Sampling and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Chib & Greenberg, 1995) .The use of Dirichlet distribution for the proportions of susceptible, infected, 135 and removed individuals in the target population are a feasible way to guarantee that the support set of these quantities has boundaries, for example, the number of infected individuals must be always positive.In this section, we present a modification to account for under-reporting in 140 the context of the Dirichlet-Beta state-space model from Osthus et al. (2017) .This adaptation is based on a reparametrization of Beta distribution that includes the reported rate estimate, η, from equation (3).The Beta distribution, as is well known, is very flexible for proportions modeling since its density can have quite different shapes depending on the values of 145 the two parameters that index this distribution (Ferrari & Cribari-Neto, 2004) .For this reason, we made a reparametrization to the Beta model in such a way that we could obtain a regression structure for the means of the response variables associated with a precision parameter. proportion and θ t = (θ S t , θ I t , θ R t ) be the true but unobservable susceptible, infectious, and removed proportions of the population, respectively.Hence, we rewrite the SIR model in terms of these unobservable proportions as the followingThen, the distributions for Y I t , Y R t , and θ t are given belowwhere φ = (β, γ, θ 0 , κ, λ I , λ R ) is the parameter vector for this model. Since we consider the beta distribution, we are assuming that E[Y I t ] = ηθ I t and E[Y R t ] = ηθ R t and the parameters λ I > 0 and λ R > 0 are responsible for controlling of the the distribution variance. Besides that, the parameter κ > 0 controls the variance of the Dirichlet distribution. The solution for the differential equations 160 in (4) is given by f (θ t−1 , β, γ), that have the role of propagating the latent state θ t forward in one time step.Note that it is necessary to obtain the solutions for the proportions θ S t θ I t and θ R t . These solutions can be found using the Runge-Kutta fourth-order method, in short RK4, for solving non-linear ordinary differential equations (Mathews, 165 1992) and can be seen in Appendix A. It is notable in Brazil a lack of testing due to the registry of only severe cases and consequently under-reporting cases of COVID-19. Taking this fact into account, we consider for this research not only the official data but also the estimates of reported rate. In order to obtain the estimate of reported rate, assume that delay in confirmation until death follows the same estimated distribution of hospitalization until death. Using data from COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, between December 17th, 2019, and January 22nd, 2020, it has a lognormal distribution with mean 180 of 13, median of 9.1 and standard deviation of 12.7 days (Linton NM, 2020) .This methodology based on the information of delay from hospitalization until death is reasonable since China was considered as one of the countries that most tested the population for the virus, and consequently, it is supposed to have a tiny under-reporting rate.Using the methodology presented in section 2 and assuming that c t in (1) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f highest reported rate 0.52. Indeed, Prado et al. (2020) found that Paraíba and Pernambuco had a low reporting rate comparing with other states. LogN(−3.215, 1.112) .The average infection period ρ comes directly from γ parameter, that is,• β -The reproduction number R 0 of the disease is estimated by the ratio R 0 = β γ . We assume that R 0 a priori belongs to lognormal distribution with mean of 3 and variance of 9. Thus β values were obtained from• The a priori distributions for k, λ I and λ R and θ 0 were obtained according to Osthus et al. (2017) , that is, The estimates from a posteriori distributions for R 0 , β, γ, k, λ I and λ R 205 were obtained through MCMC methods, specifically Gibbs sampling (Geman & Geman, 1984) . To execute the sampling procedure, we used the R programming language (R Core Team, 2020), with rjags package (Plummer, 2019) .The total number of iterations considered, as well as the discard (burn-in) and the minimum distance between one iteration to another (thin) were obtained 210 through the criterion of Raftery & Lewis (1992) in the analysis of a pilot sample with 10,000 iterations.The convergence diagnosis of the MCMC procedure was verified using the Geweke (Geweke, 1992) and Heidelberger and Welch(Heidelberger & Welch, 1983 ) criteria, which are available in the coda package (Plummer et al., 2006) . vergence diagnostics, from which we conclude that chains reached convergence for all parameters (p-value > 0.05). The inference was made by considering the reported rate estimate in Brazil,η = 0.07, a chain of 300,000 interactions was generated, with a burn-in of 10,000 and a thin of 300, resulting in a final sample 220 of 1,450 values. The parameter estimates are shown in Table 3 The inference results show thatR 0 = 3.6243 which expresses a high reproductive rate of the virus. Also,ρ = 32.1667 days shows that the time for virus infection is very close to one month period. Furthermore, Figure B .6 shows the charts of the estimated a posteriori densities for the parameters β, γ, R 0 , ρ, λ I , and λ R , from which we conclude that 230 the curves have a symmetrical shape around its modes.Using the parameter estimates from Table 3 and the latent proportion (θ), we reached information about the peak from SIR curve for the COVID-19 transmission in Brazil, that is the time when the proportion of infected individuals reaches its maximum. The peak estimate is June 18th, 2020, occurring between 235 June 12nd and June 22th, 2020 and it is shown in Figure 1 . reporting and the HPD intervals are obtained through Chen and Shao algorithm (Chen & Shao, 1999) . From Figure B . 5 The results are shown in Table B .5 on Appendix B. We can observe that the point estimates for the model parameters are very similar to the estimates from Table 3 . However, the 95% credible intervals for β and R 0 are wider than in Table 3 due to the flexibility that is given to η parameter. Moreover, the peak estimate under this more flexible Bayesian approach is June 16th, 2020, which 250 is very close to the first model when CFR is supposed to be fixed.Concerning to evaluate the effect of the notification rate on the model's estimates, a simulation study was carried out. The model was estimated considering COVID-19 data in Brazil, assuming a reporting rate between 0.05 and Figure 2 shows the point estimates and 95% credible intervals for β and γ versus the reported rate values. It can be observed that as reported rate increases, β estimate becomes lower, which means that the infectious contact rate is underestimated when under-reporting is ignored. Additionally, the removal rate γ remains almost constant when the reported rate increases, which means 265 that it is not influenced by the rates.The graphics with the point estimates and 95% credible intervals for R 0 and infection period ρ versus the reported rates are shown in Figure 3 , from which we observe that R 0 decreases as the reported rate increases and ρ keeps roughly invariant, then we can conclude that the reproduction rate and infection period Figure 4 shows the estimated SIR curves for COVID-19 versus reported rate, from which we observe that the lower the reported rate, the earlier the peak is 275 reached with a higher proportion of infected individuals. It is also observed that the contagion curves become similar to each other as the reported rates increase.These results reveal that the peak estimate of the COVID-19 transmission curve in Brazil is compromised when the presence of under-reporting is ignored.Finally, Table 4 presents the deviance information criterion (DIC) (Spiegel- as the best one that fitted the simulated data, since its DIC value is the lowest.These results suggest that the notification rate is very low.In this paper, we show that the method of adjusting cases by delay can be 285 used to determine the reported rate of COVID-19 cases. Thus, it was possible J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o farXiv:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2020/05/12/2020. 03.31.20049130 .full.pdf. ",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-24,9
ccd7ea7aa5916733971bcaf7b9dc3e6fb12ec0f6,Utility-Based Multicriteria Model for Screening Patients under the COVID-19 Pandemic,"At the start of the current year (2020), the COVID-19 disease, caused by the new coronavirus (the SARS-CoV-2), was deemed to be an epidemic. However, a few weeks later, it was reclassified as a pandemic. Since the COVID-19 has emerged, it has been present in different degrees of illness in the human organism, causing, in severe cases, acute respiratory failure [1] [2] [3] .In this context, this disease has resulted in an increasing number of patients requiring hospital treatments, especially in intensive care units (ICUs) with the support of mechanical ventilation equipment. Consequently, in many cities around the world, this increase in the demand for places in hospitals has placed a great strain on medical resources and revealed deficiencies in all forms of provision for a pandemic and therefore adequate treatment has not been available for all the severe cases.Thus, to deal with this chaotic situation, it is fundamental to have decision-making strategies in place as these are important to ensure that the expectation of the survival of COVID-19 patients can be maximized. In other words, in such situations, which involves a risk context, it is important to conduct a rational decision-making process in order to be able to save the majority of patients [4] .Therefore, in order to allow the rational conduct of an important medical decision-making problem-the screening decision problem-a utility-based multicriteria model is proposed in this study.This additive multicriteria decision-making model is based on the multiattribute utility theory (MAUT) approach [5] , which considers the concepts of the utility theory [6] , to deal with the uncertainty presented in medical diagnostics [7] . Thus, in this study, issues from operational research are considered to support a healthcare decision-making problem.Also, a decision information system (DIS), called SIDTriagem, is constructed to implement this multicriteria decision-making model. The outcome of this DIS is a recommendation about where a patient with suspected COVID-19 should be directed to, considering the alternatives presented in the screening problem. It is worth mentioning that this model is a supplement to support physicians to deal with the screening problem. It is left to the physicians to decide whether or not to follow the recommendation made.This paper as organized as follows. Section 2 details the screening decision problem. Section 3 describes the utilitybased model proposed in this study. Section 4 presents the applicability of the proposed approach and discusses these results. Finally, Section 5 draws some conclusions and indicates possible topics for future lines of research.The COVID-19 pandemic has provoked several decision situations that physicians are facing in their routines in hospitals and other health units all over the world. One of the main decision problems that they encounter every day is how best to screen patients with suspected COVID-19. A patient arrives at a health unit with symptoms and other complaints. Then, the physician has to decide, depending on the patient's clinical state, whether this patient should be sent for treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU), in a hospital ward (but not in an ICU) or whether he/she should be sent home to isolate instead of being hospitalized. This is the classical screening problem that is addressed in this paper, in which the context of the COVID-19 pandemic has been made more acute. Given that uncertainty is an inevitable factor that is inherently present in medical diagnostics and treatment decisions [6] , a decision analysis (DA) model based on the multiattribute utility theory (MAUT) is developed in order to aid physicians when they make such decisions.DA support for screening patients within the context of other diseases has been widely explored in the literature. Xu et al. [8] used a DA approach based on decision trees to investigate strategies for the triage of patients with symptoms of acute stroke. Outcomes were measured based on workflow times. Probabilities and input parameters were estimated based on guidelines and previously published studies. A practical analysis was conducted using TreeAge Pro software. Jiang et al. [9] designed a DA tree in order to evaluate the best strategy for treating patients after an esophagectomy. The TreeAge Pro software was used to construct the decision tree. Two strategies were compared based on several factors, such as length of stay in the hospital, costs, and possible complications. A sensitivity analysis was performed by using a Monte-Carlo simulation. Felder and Mayrhofer [10] analyze the impact of risk preferences in decisions about medical screening, testing, and treatment. They conclude that a risk averse decision-maker tests and treats patients at lower probabilities of illness, compared to risk neutral and risk vulnerable decision-makers. Cleary et al. (2005) [11] applied DA techniques for comparing three different strategies of screening for herpes, a simple virus, in pregnant women; probability estimations were derived from DA on the literature. Kiberd and Forward [12] developed a DA-based study to investigate the impact of medical screening decisions for West Nile virus in organ transplantation, by considering lives lost and saved.A cost-effective analysis approach was also widely used by authors when dealing with DA models for screening patients, and these studies covered a wide range of diseases. Wilson and Howe [13] developed a DA model for screening methods of dysphagia after stroke. Different strategies were compared based on a cost-effective analysis. Medical costs were measured from a societal perspective, and effectiveness was measured in years of quality-adjusted life. Sensitivity analysis using a Monte-Carlo simulation was performed. Donnan et al. [14] conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis for DA of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Probabilities were obtained based on published evidence in the literature, and survival was measured in months of life. Cooper et al. [15] constructed a decision analysis model to handle health outcome states and costs of screening strategies for children in preoperative coagulation tests prior to a tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Probabilities, costs, and utility data were estimated based on a review of databases. Sensitivity analysis was performed so that parameters were widely varied. Baeten et al. [16] conducted a study to show the potential and impact of three approaches in the use of cost-effective analysis in the scope of breast cancer control: targeting specific groups, by comparing disparities; equity weighting, by valuing high and low health gains differently; and multicriteria decision analysis, giving weights for multiple equity and efficient criteria. Oh et al. [17] used DA based on a cost-effective approach to compare different strategies for screening rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Data were obtained from previous studies and from real practical cases. Rulyak et al. [18] applied DA for screening strategies in familial pancreatic cancer kindreds. Life expectancy and lifetime medical care costs were modeled in order to conduct a cost-effective analysis. McGrath et al. (2002) [19] used DA software (TreeAgre Pro) for comparing four strategies for screening patients with colorectal cancer, taking into account the cost to find an advanced adenoma. Probabilities, test characteristics, and costs were estimated based on a literature review and local costs.In this context, this paper is aimed at presenting a multicriteria model for screening patients with suspected COVID-19, based on a DA approach within the multiattribute utility theory. Two main factors are taken into account: the life of the patient being screened and the cost of the alternative indicated for that patient. These criteria are further detailed in this paper. Subjective probabilities are considered for the construction of a decision tree for the screening problem. The next section details the whole structure of the mathematical model proposed for the screening problem.In this context, in the decision tree constructed, the alternatives indicated to conduct the health treatment for the patients with suspected COVID-19 are identified. In the screening problem investigated in this study, three alternatives are considered; these alternatives are ICU stay (ICU), hospital stay (HS), and isolation at home (IH).Also, for each one of these alternatives, the uncertainty is presented, since according to [6] , uncertainty is an inevitable factor that is inherently present in treatment decisions. Thus, in an uncertainty context, the consequences to be obtained depend on the alternatives and the state of nature [6, 21] .In other words, for each alternative and each state of nature, which is represented by the chances to survive and chances to death, a consequence is obtained. For the alternative ICU stay, the patient can survive the ICU stay or die during the ICU stay. For the alternative hospital stay, the patient can survive the hospital stay or die during the hospital stay. Finally, for the alternative isolation at home, the patient can survive isolation at home or die during isolation at home.It is worth mentioning that in the decision tree technique the squares are the decision nodes, the circles are the chance nodes, and the arrows are used to connect these decision elements [8] . In this context, in the decision tree constructed, four squares and three circles are presented. The decision tree constructed is illustrated in Figure 1 .Based on the decision tree illustrated in Figure 1 , the mathematical model used to construct the utility-based multicriteria model is described in the next section. This mathematical model connected the decision elements presented in Figure 1 to obtain the recommendations (outputs) for the screening problem investigated.In this section, the mathematical model, presented in the utility-based multicriteria model, is described. This mathematical model is based on the multiattribute utility theory (MAUT) [4] and takes into account the concepts of the utility theory [6] and multicriteria approach [5, 22, 23] .The utility theory [6] is a very appropriate way to deal with decision-making under uncertainty. In this context, states of the world (or states of nature) are used to represent the uncertainty presented in the decision scenario. Also, for each state of nature, probabilities are assigned to represent their chance of occurring, and these are obtained by an expert or by the decision-maker (from the subjective expected utility model) [21] .In this context, regarding the screening decisionmaking process considered in this study, the states of nature are survival or death, and the alternatives are the options to conduct the healthcare treatment with the patients with suspected COVID-19, with three alternatives being considered: ICU stay (ICU), hospital stay (HS) and isolation at home (IH).Also, two criteria are considered in this complex decision situation, the life of the patient being screened and the cost of the alternative indicated for that patient. The cost of an alternative is subjectively related to the impact on the health system, considering resource constraints. Therefore, alternative ""home isolation,"" for example, presents no cost for the health system, since the patient will stay at home and no health resources will be occupied by this patient. For alternative ""ICU stay,"" however, the cost for the health system might be high, especially when ICU occupation is high and resources are scarce. The alternatives are evaluated in each one of these criteria, considering the multicriteria decision scenario [5, 22, 23] .Thus, for this decision-making problem, the decisionmaker's preferences are assumed to be represented by MAUT [5] . In this context, from the corroboration of the additive independence condition, the additive aggregation analytic form is used to construct the mathematical model. The multiattribute utility function is presented in equation (1), where a is the alternative, k j is the scaling constant for criterion j, and u j ðaÞ is the marginal utility function in criterion j:It is worth mentioning that the scaling constants are obtained by applying an elicitation procedure with a decision-maker. The values of the scaling constants, for both criteria, are equal to 0.5 and their sum is equal to 1, in accordance with MAUT concepts [5] . The values of the scaling constants are presented in equation (2):Also, the utility functions represent the consequences in each state of nature. For this study, the marginal utility functions are also obtained in the elicitation procedure. In this context, for the criterion patient's life, the utility functions are equal for the three alternatives, namely, 1 if the state of nature is survival and 0 if the state of nature is death. Equations (3) and (4) illustrate this condition:On the other hand, regarding the criterion cost, the utility function is the same, since it does not depend on the state of nature. In this situation, the resources were consumed in the hope of saving the patient, regardless of whether the patient survives or dies.In addition, for the criterion cost, the utility function for the alternative ICU stay presented the worst value, since the health treatment in ICU is more expensive. Analogously, for the alternative isolation at home, the utility function presented the highest value, it being the most desirable alternative [24] [25] [26] .An important consideration for the ICU stay utility function is the dependence regarding another variable, which is associated to the probability of a ""future patient"" arriving in the healthcare system, in a severe condition, and requiring to be sent to the ICU, combined with the occupation rate of the ICU. This variable is called Fp, this being an acronym of the probability of a future patient arriving in the healthcare 3 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine system. If Fp is equal to 1, this indicates that no beds are available in the ICU. In this context, the utility function for this situation presents the worst value, this being a chaotic situation. In this scenario, it is difficult to accommodate patients in the ICU, with a tendency to recommend the alternatives hospital stay or isolation at home. As to these considerations, the utility function for an ICU stay, for the evaluation in the criterion cost, is defined according to equation (5):For the worst case, when the ICU is completely occupied, Fp is equal to 1 (which means that sending the patient to the ICU would lead to a very high cost, thus leading to an utility equal to 0). In the opposite extreme case, Fp would be equal to 0. However, a parameterization for three possible cases between these two extreme situations is considered for the decision information system: high occupation (Fp = 0:7), intermediate occupation (Fp = 0:5), and low occupation (Fp = 0:3). In order to define these values of 0.7, 0.5, and 0.3, three doctors were consulted and simulations were performed in order to verify which values fit best according to doctors' actual attitude. It is worth mentioning, however, that these values depend on the decision-maker judgments, and in the SIDTriagem, these ranges can be adjusted if the user so desires.The utility function for isolation at home, in the criterion cost, i.e., ðUðChiÞÞ, is equal to 1. Also, the utility function for hospital stay ðUðChsÞÞ is between 0 and 1. In this study, the utility function equal to 0.8 is considered. However, a variation can be applied using the Monte-Carlo simulation, as presented in the next section.Finally, another important variable to be considered in this mathematical model is the subjective probability assigned for each state of nature in order represent its chance of occurring. Thus, these probabilities are given by the physicians, considering their subjective evaluation about the patient's state of health.In other words, the physician has to define a probability of surviving (chance of surviving) for the patient considering each one of the alternatives. These probabilities are represented by πðShiÞ,πðShsÞ, and πðSicuÞ; their sum being equal to 1. Also, the chance to dying is the complementary probability of the chance to survive.Therefore, based on these considerations, the utilitybased multicriteria model constructed for the screening decision problem is described by equations (6)- (8) . Computational and Mathematical Methods in MedicineAs to equations (6)- (8) , the physicians receive a recommendation about which alternative is the best one for accommodating the COVID-19 patient. This is the one that presents the highest multiattribute utility function.In the next section, a practical application of this utilitybased multicriteria model is presented in order to illustrate how this mathematical model is used to support the decision-making problem about screening. Also, the decision information system, called SIDTriagem, is presented.To apply the proposed model for aiding the screening of patients with suspected COVID-19, the physician should first input information about the patient's chances of survival in three scenarios: isolation at home, a hospital stay, or in an intensive care unit (ICU). This information should be given based on the patient's symptoms and clinical state. These chances of survival, however, are not precisely established and involve subjective factors that may not be quantified. Therefore, during the development of the system, three physicians were consulted by an analyst in order to find out what would make them feel more comfortable about providing such information. As a result of this consultation process, it was verified that the physicians preferred to give information about chances of survival on a verbal scale, instead of providing numbers. Thus, a 5-point Likert scale was developed for establishing such probabilities: very low, low, medium, high, and very high. Each of these levels is associated to a probability range of 20% width, which was also calibrated with the physicians. The reason of using probability ranges instead of exact values of probabilities is related to the inherent imprecision and subjectivity of this information. Table 1 illustrates the association of each level of the scale with the probability ranges.According to those probability ranges, a Monte-Carlo simulation is performed in order to obtain a recommendation of conduct for the physician. At each simulation instance, a random number between the lower and upper limits of Table 1 is generated for each probability of survival, according to a uniform distribution and taking into account the levels of the verbal scale provided by the user. The recommendation given by the model is based on a robustness index that is computed for each alternative. The robustness index of an alternative is related to the percentage of simulation instances in which the expected overall utility of that alternative is greater than the expected utility of the other alternatives, in accordance with Equations (5)- (7) . The model therefore recommends that the user follow the alternative with the largest robustness index.The proposed approach for aiding the screening of patients with suspected COVID-19 is operated by means of a DIS, called SIDTriagem, which is available for users at http://insid.org.br/sidtriagem/app/. Physicians log on to the system and then he/she enters the patient's name, age, and gender (optional data). Figure 2 shows the interface of the system, with a practical hypothetical example.In Figure 2 , a 67 year-old woman is considered to have been evaluated by the user of the system (a physician) at a healthcare unit. By examining this patient and analyzing all her symptoms and her clinical state, the physician enters information about the chances of survival of this woman in three scenarios: in an ICU, in a hospital ward, and during isolation at home. Let us assume that the physician evaluates her as either very high or medium or very low, respectively. Then, the physician should estimate the ICU occupancy rate at that time, also on a verbal scale: low, intermediate, and high. As previously explained in Section 3.2, this ICU occupancy rate is for calibration of the Fp parameter, which influences the utility of the cost of sending the patient to the ICU. Let us consider that there is intermediate occupancy rate at that moment. Finally, the physician may optimally state how confident he/she is about the information provided: very unconfident, unconfident, neutral, confident, very confident, or even N/A. This information is not used by the mathematical model, but it may be further used in future studies to evaluate the behavior of physicians in such situations.After entering all the input data, the user clicks on the ""Calculate"" button and the recommendations obtained based on the simulations are shown to the user. In this case, the recommendation of the system is to send the patient to the ICU, with 87% of robustness. This means that, in 87% of the simulations instances performed, this alternative had the highest expected utility, compared to hospital stay and isolation at home. Hospital stay had a robustness index of 13%, which means that in 13% of the simulation instances this alternative had the greatest expected utility value. The robustness index for isolation at home was 0, indicating that this alternative never wins against the others in terms of expected utility.The system also provides user with an alternative way of visualizing the results. By clicking on the ""Switch to graphical visualization"" button at the bottom of Figure 2 , a bar graphic appears as an alternative possible visualization, as Figure 3 shows. These two ways of visualization were included in the system due to the feedback of the physicians; some of whom prefer to visualize them in a table with numbers, and others prefer graphics. Therefore, the system provides both numbers and graphics.Finally, the user may choose to state whether or not he/she intends to follow the recommendation. Also, there is a space for recording the feedback of the users of the system, by clicking on the ""Conclude"" button. This feedback helps to make further improvements to the model and to the system itself.It should be highlighted here that this system should be used as a support tool for aiding screening decisions, based on a structured mathematical model. There are no normative 5 Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine purposes, however, with the use of this system. A recommendation is given, but the final decision always rests with the physician, who should take into account all subjective factors involved in each specific situation.In this paper, a utility-based multicriteria model for aiding screening decision situations of patients with suspected COVID-19 was proposed. The screening problem is critical due to the scarcity of treatment resources in hospitals, such as ICU beds, for instance. Therefore, a structured mathematical modeling of this problem is important for aiding physicians to decide if a suspected COVID-19 patient should go to an ICU, a hospital ward, or stay at home in isolation.The mathematical model was built based on the decision analysis concepts and multiattribute utility theory (MAUT), considering the inherent stochastic nature of this decision-making problem. Considering the inherent imprecision associated to estimating the patient's chances of survival, the proposed model works with probability ranges that serve as an input for a Monte-Carlo simulation model. Moreover, considering the difficulty that physicians have in providing this information due to the subjectivity of the factors involved, a verbal scale is used for estimating patients' chances of survival.The proposed approach is operated by means of a decision information system, which has a user-friendly interface and can be easily used by physicians in healthcare units worldwide. The information obtained from the occurrences registered in the system is stored in a database. Finally, as suggestions for future research, the occurrences registered in the system would be extremely useful for conducting several kinds of analyses, including a comparative analysis of what the model proposes and what doctors actually do, in practice. Also, behavioral studies based on the data Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine obtained from the physicians' records may be useful for improving the design of decision information systems and their functionalities.The database generated from the occurrences registered in the SIDTriagem used to support the findings of this study are restricted by the Ethical Committee in Research of the Federal University of Pernambuco with CAAE (""Certificado de Apresentação e Aprecição Ética"" -Certificate of Presentation and Ethical Appreciation) number 31065820.5.0000.5208 in order to protect patient privacy.

e0eb36c1c52fb371dd08ce3dbf13223c08d7b71f,Epidemiology and Infection Survival and predictors of deaths of patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 from a retrospective and multicentre cohort study in Brazil,"During the early 20th century, the medical field supported an optimistic discourse on technological advances in the area and the control of infectious diseases, which for many centuries were the main causes of mortality in the world. However, several pathogens that have evolved or increased their ability to infect human beings have shown that curing communicable diseases must be a challenge for scientists for a long time to come. Examples of this are the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and now SARS-CoV-2 viruses, initially discovered as zoonoses which managed to change their transmission mechanism and start promoting direct human-to-human infection [1] .The infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 was classified as a differentiated clinical condition, which led to its inclusion as a new one, called Coronavirus Disease 2019 . The first cases were reported in the peninsula of Wuhan in China, in December 2019, characterised by the high transmissibility power and causing of a severe acute respiratory dysfunction, with variations between mild, moderate and severe forms, a mortality rate growing according to older ages and to the presence of previous comorbidities, especially those that lead to some degree of cardiovascular impairment [2, 3] .As of 16 May 2020, the World Health Organization has reported 4 530 000 people infected with a total of 307 000 deaths worldwide. In Brazil, there are 220 000 confirmed cases and 14 962 deaths caused by the disease on the same date, which places the largest country in Latin America as the second in the world in terms of the rising epidemic curve of active cases and deaths [4] .The great challenge for Brazilian health authorities is to reduce the number of these cases to the minimum, especially the most serious ones, which require hospitalisation with the support of invasive mechanical ventilation. The international experiences of countries affected by the COVID-19 epidemic demonstrate that, once the installed capacity of health services is overcome, the disease can raise its lethality rate to worrying levels, possibly leading to the death of millions of people due to the total lack health care, especially in a scenario of economic crisis and intense social inequality, which makes millions of Brazilians living in underprivileged communities more susceptible to death [5] .In Brazil, hospital bed occupancy rates are already at 100% in some states and health professionals are beginning to have to adopt patient admission criteria based on their chances of survival. Complicated decisions as this one, which can mean life and death, need maximum scientific support in order to minimise the harm to all patients. Given this scenario, the current study aims to analyse the survival of inpatients and estimate the prognostic factors of patients admitted to Brazilian hospitals due to the COVID-19. Studies with this purpose, with a significant sample and with the level of scientific evidence of this design have not yet been published in the country.Therefore, its findings may support the creation of scientifically supported clinical management protocols, minimising conflicting situations and subsidising decisions made in the hospital setting. In the face of a new disease that has no recognised treatment, vaccine or even its pathophysiology fully clarified, survival data and predictive factors are important instruments for the rational control of the epidemic and for scientific purposes, in order to better understand variables not yet discussed about COVID-19.A retrospective, multicentre cohort study, of the survival analysis type, was carried out in order to estimate the prognostic factors of patients admitted to Brazilian hospitals due to COVID-19. Secondary, public and anonymous data were used from the notification forms of hospitalised patients and notified by SARS-COV-2 in hospitals in Brazil, in the observation period from 20 February 2020 to 2 June 2020. All hospitalised subjects and those confirmed with COVID-19 through the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) exam were included in the study.There were 80 125 hospitalisations due to COVID-19 registered in the public national epidemiological surveillance system, obtained from the open access database [6] , public and anonymous. The counting of the follow-up time starts from the first day of hospitalisation until the date of death or discharge. Records of subjects with missing hospitalisation dates or inconsistencies in their diagnostic record were excluded from the study. These represent 2.94% (2363/80 125) of the records. Censorship occurred in patients who were discharged or transferred, however, all records used in this study had an outcome definition until 2 June 2020, excluding from the cohort patients who were still hospitalised, representing 39.28% of the records (19 156/80 125) (Fig. 1) .The co-variables used to compare survival curves were socioeconomic factors (age, sex, race, education and area of residence), clinical signs and symptoms (fever, cough, sore throat, diarrhoea and vomiting), hospital variables (influenza-like outbreak, hospital-acquired infection, dyspnoea, respiratory distress, O 2 saturation <95%, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU length of stay and X-ray result), chronic disease (heart disease, haematology, Down's syndrome, liver disease, asthma, diabetes mellitus, neurological disease, pneumopathy, immunodepression, kidney disease and body mass index (BMI)), if the patient has had a flu vaccine, use of antiviral against influenza and what is the type of such antiviral. The other variables on the notification form, whose completion was irregular on less than 5% of the cases, were excluded from the analysis (Supplementary form).The data were analysed from the estimates of survival functions, using the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method [7] . The logrank test and the Wilcoxon test were used to compare the survival functions for each socio-demographic covariate, signs or symptoms, hospital and clinical covariate. The numerical variable age was categorised by tertile and the categorical variables race and education were recategorised according to the similarity of the survival curves of each category, aggregating them by theoretical category. Due to the sample size, a value of P ⩽ 0.01 was considered to accept the significant differences in the survival curves.To assess the risk factors associated with death, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, following Cox's proportional hazards model [8] . Covariates with a P-value <0.250 were used to create the multiple models. The modelling was initiated by the most significant variables, both at the level of statistical significance and at the theoretical level, respecting the risk proportionality test and absence of multicollinearity to be able to test the variable in the model. The final model was tested, the device and Cox-Snell residues were analysed. The data were analysed using the STATA 12.0 program and in all analyses the level of significance was considered equal to 5%.Between 20 February 2020 and 2 June 2020, 46 285 hospitalisations due to COVID-19 were followed retrospectively. The The overall survival rate estimate was of 79.21% (95% CI 78.82-79.59) in 5 days of hospitalisation and 59.22% (95% CI 58.69-59.76) in 10 days (Fig. 2) . In Table 1 , when comparing the survival curves from the socio-demographic covariates, there is a significantly lower estimate of survival in 10 days in cases of ages above 68 years of 45.4% (95% CI 44.6-46.2), black or mixed race of 51.3% (95% CI 50.3-52.2), living in the countryside 48.8% (95% CI 45.0-52.5) and illiterate 37.4% (95% CI 34.0-40.9).Comparing at the same cutoff point in 10 days (Table 1) , survival estimates were significantly lower when the subjects had dyspnoea 57.0% (95% CI 56.4-57.6), respiratory distress 55.7% (95% CI 55.0-56.4), O 2 saturation <95% 54.4% (95% CI 53.7-55.0), mixed X-ray alteration 60.5% (95% CI 57.8-63.0), were admitted to the ICU 54.5% (95% CI 53.7-55.3), when the length of stay in the ICU was up to 8 days 15.0% (95% CI 14.0-16.0), when they had invasive ventilatory support 41.6% (95% CI 40.7-42.6) and influenza-like outbreak 56.4% (95% CI 55.4-57.5). Still in Table 1 , there was a lower estimate of the 10-day survival rate when the patient had chronic disease, such as heart disease 54.4% (95% CI 53. 5 (Fig. 3) .This multicentre retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 found important differences in survival times, as well as risk factors or protection for the death of patients in Brazilian hospitals. There was a reduced overall survival time, in addition to an association with lower survival estimates and a higher risk of death related to age, race, education, zone, dyspnoea, respiratory distress, influenza-like outbreak, O 2 saturation, X-ray changes of chest, ICU stay, length of stay in ICU, use of ventilatory support, presence of heart disease, diabetes, Down's syndrome, pneumopathy, kidney disease and neurological disease. The variables of clinical signs or symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore throat, diarrhoea or vomiting, showed greater survival and less risk of death. Finally, the presence of asthma had a better prognosis. The overall survival of patients hospitalised for treatment of COVID-19 in Brazil was of 62.05%. This survival is shown to be lower than other survival studies of hospitalised patients in Brazil. A retrospective cohort study developed by Bonfada et al., whose objective was to analyse the survival of elderly patients admitted to the ICU in a low-development region, found an overall survival of 66.64%, which reinforces the concern about the lethality of COVID-19 in countries with limited resources [9] .The lack of care and clinical management protocols for patients hospitalised by COVID-19 in Brazil, closely linked to internal political disputes in the country, and the consequent delay in training the health teams have a direct influence on this context. In addition, there is no strategy for testing the asymptomatic population and even for those with suggestive symptoms there is a delay in the diagnosis of about 10 days for the confirmatory result via RT-PCR, a time interval in which there is already a drop in survival to 62.05%.In our study when comparing survivals by socio-demographic covariates, a worse prognosis was found for patients over 68 years of age, with 2.77 times the risk of death. Besides, it was found that black or mixed-race people had a risk of death 1.54 times bigger, and illiterate people 3.29 times. All consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the Renmin Hospital of the Wuhan University, were enrolled in a retrospective cohort study. One-third of the patients got better in hospital during follow-up. Twenty-five patients died, the mortality rate was 3.77%. In this study, older patients were prone to have severe COVID-19 symptoms and worsen, and were more likely to die in the hospital [10] . Another cohort study identified several risk factors for death in adults who were hospitalised with COVID-19. Older age was also associated with higher odds of in-hospital death, it revealed age ⩾65 years as a strong predictor for death from COVID-19 pneumonia [11, 12] .According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), Brazil has a population of about 211 million inhabitants, among which there are 25 million elderly people and 55 million people who are below the poverty line, a group that is mostly composed by black people with low education [13] . Populations that live under vulnerability or social inequity often have less access to information and health services and they may reach hospital services late. In the same way, most of the people working as self-employed or underemployed, are forced out of social isolation, often without protection, to ensure the livelihood of their families, what makes them subject to potential infection rates even higher. In this sense, health policies need to have access to the information considered above to promote an adequate confrontation with reality, especially by creating protection mechanisms for these vulnerable groups. Otherwise, the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil runs the risk of being a catalyst that assumes a higher risk of death of 26% to its entire population, indirectly characterised as a means of eugenics, based on socio-economic and demographic criteria, worrying and incongruent with the constitutional principles and the guarantee of the principle of equity in health care, one of the pillars of the Brazilian public health system. Underprivileged people are at higher risk of infection and death from COVID-19, and they have less access to care due to systems that treat health as a commodity and not a human right [14, 15] .When assessing the context of clinical variables, significance was found for better survival when patients presented signs or symptoms at the time of hospital admission, such as fever, cough, vomiting, sore throat or diarrhoea, showing they may still be in the viral replication phase, therefore, the presence of signs or symptoms in this phase could be less severe. In addition, it is likely that patients will have a less severe reaction by the immune system, which would differ from other patients who may progress abruptly to clinical severity, without having any of these symptoms at the beginning of the hospitalisation.COVID-19 pneumonia is a multistate disease with clinically relevant intermediate endpoints like severity onset. Most survival data analyses set this onset as the primary endpoint, and censor recovery or hospital discharge. However, when competing risks of severity onset are present, this analytical method induces bias. The risk of severe progression assessed without considering the competition would be overestimated because the patients who would never progress (those who discharged from the hospital without progression) were treated as if they could progress [16] .It has been shown that the ICU length of stay of up to three days has the worst prognosis, which reinforces our hypothesis that patients worsen their clinical condition abruptly during hospitalisation, and admission to the ICU would have little therapeutic capacity in more severe cases of COVID-19. However, it would be necessary to develop prospective cohort studies to monitor, mainly, the changes in the clinical signs of patients with COVID-19 and their impact on the survival of hospitalised patients and how this interferes with the length of stay in the ICU.The level and duration of infectious virus replication are important factors in assessing the risk of transmission and guiding decisions regarding isolation of patients. Because the coronavirus RNA detection is more sensitive than the virus isolation, most studies have used qualitative or quantitative viral RNA tests as a potential marker for infectious coronavirus. The detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA persisted for a median of 20 days in survivors and it was sustained until death in non-survivors [11] . In addition to clinical symptoms, an important result found in this study was asthma as a protective factor against death. Interestingly, the prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 was of 0.9% in an ambispective cohort study of consecutive hospitalised patient. Thus, it was speculated that TH2 immune response in patients with asthma may counter the inflammation process induced by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are required to characterise the immune response and inflammation features of COVID-19 [17] .Hospitalised patients in the No. 7 Hospital of Wuhan, clinically diagnosed with 'viral pneumonia' based on their clinical symptoms (fever or respiratory symptoms) with typical changes in chest radiology, were preliminarily involved in a study. No asthmatic patient was identified in this report, and only a few patients had selfreported drug hypersensitivity and urticaria. Virus infections have been associated with acute exacerbation of asthma, and allergy may not be a risk factor for virus infection. It is plausible that this concept may also apply to SARS-CoV-2; however, having no asthma patients and no respiratory allergies does not support this concept at least in this series of 140 patients [18] .Regardless of the socio-demographic variables, signs and symptoms, when analysing the risks in the multivariate model, patients who were admitted to the ICU or who had diabetes or heart, kidney and neurological diseases as comorbidities had the worst prognosis.Most severe patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Tongji Hospital that were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up showed rapid progression and multiple organ dysfunction. During hospitalisation, a substantial proportion of patients presented cardiac injury, liver and kidney dysfunction and hyperglycaemia. This current study also revealed that hyperglycaemia was related to increased mortality in patients with COVID-19. The prevalence of hyperglycaemia may be associated with underlying diabetes and corticosteroid therapy [17] .Led by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, a retrospective cohort was established, to study COVID-19 admitted cases from 575 hospitals throughout China [19] . Non-survivors present a higher proportion of various coexisting chronic illnesses in the univariate analysis. Coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are confirmed to be independent risk factors for death. Another study in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital revealed that underlying cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases contributed to high mortality from COVID-19 pneumonia [12] .There were 220 patients with confirmed COVID-19 recruited from the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The current study showed that 161 COVID-19 patients (80.5%) presented at least one of the comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, hepatic disease, cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease and others. Interestingly, COVID-19 patients with chronic pulmonary disease, mainly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obviously presented elevated risk of death. It was found that there was a trend for hypertension and diabetes to elevate the risk of death from COVID-19 pneumonia [20] .In this aspect, it is necessary to develop strategies that aim to make a consistent clinical assessment on the organic impacts in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and comorbidities. Because of these, of course, there is already a higher risk of death on hospitalisation due to factors such as a greater inflammatory response, propensity to chronic endothelial lesions and intravascular coagulation, acid/basic blood imbalance and impaired immune response.Although the study with secondary data notification forms has its limitations, this problem is partially solved, mainly due to the urgency of the country in maintaining more accurate data in the monitoring of COVID-19, so that health institutions are able to plan actions to control the epidemic. In some cases, there was incomplete documentation of the history and symptoms in the electronic database, even after making efforts regarding feedback and recollection. Some diagnoses of co-existing illnesses were originated in self-reports from patients at their admission, which might lead to recall bias.However, this study has a robust methodology, with appropriate data analysis and the first research in the country with all hospitalisation in this gap of time. Furthermore, this research confirmed the importance of age and the presence of chronic diseases not only in the incidence of more serious cases of COVID-19, but also its effects on the drop in the survival curve of patients in hospitals in Brazil, which is considered one of the worldwide epicentres to COVID-19 nowadays.In conclusion, it is considered to be important that scientifically supported protocols are developed for the management of appropriate clinical care for patients in hospital due to the COVID-19, especially in the face of a scenario where there is no consensus on pharmacological treatment or even therapeutic management. It is worth mentioning the importance in the development of new studies, such as controlled and randomised clinical trials, in order to reaffirm the results of the current study, especially regarding the variable asthma as a protective factor against death.",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-07,9
55aee7106a0db126cf33d8703da4f2df8f4ba3e6,Impact of mandatory preventive isolation on daily physical activity and weight of children in Colombia during the SARS-cov-2 pandemic,"Introducción En Colombia desde el 24 de marzo hasta el 31 de agosto de 2020 los niños y adolescentes estuvieron 162 días en total aislamiento preventivo obligatorio por la pandemia del Covid 19. Conocer y evaluar el comportamiento de ellos durante este período de confinamiento fue importante para saber las consecuencias sobre la actividad física y el aumento peso.Se elaboró una encuesta virtual abierta realizada en la plataforma de encuestas de Google, dirigida a los padres con 5 preguntas: 1. Edad de su hijo: 2. ¿Cuántos minutos por día de actividad física en casa realiza? 3. ¿Cuántos minutos de pantallas (TV, computador, celular, videojuegos, etc.) por día? 4 ¿Cuántas horas duerme en la noche? 5. ¿El peso corporal de su hijo(a) se ha elevado? ¿Cuánto? Se distribuyó en las bases de datos de la Asociación de Medicina del Deporte y de la Fundación Colombiana del Corazón a través de las redes sociales como WhatsApp y correos electrónicos.Resultados Se realizaron 1.139 encuestas virtuales . Se encontró que durante el período de aislamiento obligatorio: el 75.2% de los niños no realizó los minutos recomendados de actividad física por la Organización Mundial de la salud (OMS), que el 82.8 % superó el tiempo de 60 minutos frente a dispositivos electrónicos y que el 44 % se aumentó de peso.En los períodos de confinamiento es importante el diseño de estrategias y procesos educativos que promuevan en los niños estilos de vida que se puedan conservar a futuro en el adulto.Palabras clave: covid-19; niños; aislamiento; alimentación; actividad física; sobrepeso.In Colombia from March 24 to August 31, 2020, children and adolescents spent 162 days in total mandatory preventive isolation due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Knowing and evaluating their behavior during this period of confinement was important to know the consequences on the physical activity and weight gain.An open virtual survey was developed on the Google survey platform, addressed to parents with 5 questions: 1. The age of your child: 2. How many minutes of physical activity at home do you do? 3 How many minutes of screens (TV, computer, cell phone, video games, etc.) per day? 4 How many hours do you sleep at night? 5. Has your child's body weight increased? How much?. It was distributed in the databases of the Association of Sports Medicine and the Colombian Heart Foundation through social networks such as WhatsApp and emails.1,139 virtual surveys were conducted. It was found that during the mandatory isolation period: 75.2% of the children did not perform the minutes of physical activity recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), that 82.8% exceeded the time of 60 minutes versus to electronic devices and that 44% weight gained.In periods of confinement, it is important to design educational strategies and processes that promote healthy lifestyles in children that can be preserved in the future in adults.Key words: covid-19; children; isolation; feeding; physical activity; overweight.La primera secuencia genérica, identificada por el Instituto Nacional de Salud, estableció que el del virus, SARS-CoV2 llegó a Colombia el 26 de febrero de 2020 y pertenece a la segunda generación de una cadena de transmisión desde un caso importado originado en España 1 .Un mes después de la detección de primer caso de contagio por COVID-19 en Colombia el gobierno nacional decretó el primer aislamiento preventivo obligatorio, que tuvo 8 prórrogas. La cuarentena en todo el país inició el martes 24 de marzo a la media noche y, con la última extensión, finalizó el 31 de agosto. 2 . Quiere decir que en total se sumaron 162 días de aislamiento obligatorio para la gran mayoría de colombianos, entre ellos los niños y los adultos mayores de 70 años. 3 El Aislamiento Preventivo Obligatorio es el período designado para que la ciudadanía permanezca aislada. La medida gubernamental limita totalmente la libre circulación de personas y vehículos en el territorio nacional con excepciones que se fueron aumentando paulatinamente en los decretos que el Gobierno fue dando a conocer con cada extensión o prórroga.Estas excepciones, especialmente desde la primera semana de mayo, fueron permitiendo la flexibilización del aislamiento 4 .Para los niños, la primera flexibilización se dio en la primera semana de mayo. Quiere decir que los niños permanecieron en cuarentena absoluta 48 días.Según el Decreto del Gobierno ""con el fin de proteger a los niños, niñas y adolescentes de posibles trastornos mentales como depresión o ansiedad, que se pueden presentar por el Aislamiento Preventivo Obligatorio"", dispuso que a partir del 11 de mayo los menores entre 6 y 17 años podrían salir de sus casas, por media hora y tres días a la semana, para que tomen aire, disfruten del sol y caminen.El 23 de junio, cuando el aislamiento obligatorio, se extendió hasta el 15 de julio y después hasta el 31 de agosto, la medida de mayo fue extendida a los niños de 2 a 5 años, y se autorizó que puedan realizar actividades al aire libre tres veces a la semana durante 30 minutos y alargando a una hora el tiempo concedido a los niños entre 6 y 17 años.Las medidas hicieron énfasis en la prohibición del uso de patines, bicicletas y balones, así como la utilización de los elementos y juegos de los parques.La decisión que ""busca que haya un momento de esparcimiento de los niños, niñas y adolescentes"" delegó en los padres y cuidadores la responsabilidad del cumplimiento de las normas de seguridad sanitaria por parte de los menores, precisando que los niños entre los 2 y 13 años deben estar acompañados por un adulto de entre 18 y 59 años, que no haga parte de la población en riesgo de contagiarse del virus, como adultos mayores o personas con preexistencias de salud.Las medidas complementarias obligaron además a los menores de edad a lavarse las manos al salir, usar el tapabocas, mantener un distanciamiento de dos metros y no alejarse del hogar en un perímetro de un kilómetro. Al regreso al hogar se debe hacer un lavado de las suelas de los zapatos, cambio de ropa y baño del cuerpo.El aislamiento obligatorio es inédito en el país, nunca lo había afrontado la población colombiana, y específicamente ese aislamiento en los niños empezó a provocar diversas polémicas sobre si era necesario y si fue bien argumentado técnicamente. La evidencia disponible aún es muy poca para sacar conclusiones, especialmente porque los estudios del impacto del aislamiento sobre los niños deben evaluar consideraciones sociales, económicas e incluso epidemiológicas.Los niños son más sintomáticos y transmisores de las enfermedades respiratorias comunes, al punto que es una de las causas más significativas del aumento de la ""Tasa de Mortalidad Infantil"" en menores de 5 años, según cifras de la Organización Mundial de la Salud 5 . Esta realidad histórica sin embargo no se cumple con el COVID-19, pues los reportes en todos los países que han sufrido el contagio precisan que los niños tienen una tendencia a manifestar de forma más leve la infección por el nuevo coronavirus y que la letalidad es muy baja 6 . Estudios iniciales realizados en China, Estados Unidos, Corea e Italia concluyeron que los niños contagiados en más de un 90% resultaron asintomáticos o con sintomatología de leve a moderada. Como producto de estos estudios el Imperial College concluyó que la probabilidad de morir por COVID-19, en niños reportados con la enfermedad, en los casos fue de apenas 0,00260% (Case Fatality Ratio -CFR-) 7,8 .La decisión, por lo tanto, de confinar a los niños, no se dio pensando en su cuidado, sino en la capacidad que podría tener de contagiar a otras personas. Por esa razón se cerraron escuelas, colegios y universidades.Tras las 20 semanas que cumplió el aislamiento obligatorio, al finalizar el 31 de agosto, ha venido surgiendo una fuerte polémica sobre el impacto que esta situación obligada tendrá en la salud física y mental de los niños, por las restricciones impuestas en la práctica de la actividad física, la ausencia de contacto con la naturaleza y la imposibilidad de realizar juegos al aire libre.De la misma forma ha venido creciendo la polémica sobre el papel de los niños como transmisores del COVID-19. No hay estudios concluyentes que hayan permitido establecer la probabilidad de transmisión de un niño enfermo asintomático o con manifestaciones leves. Tampoco existen estudios poblaciones que hayan identificado de manera concluyente cuáles son los grupos de edad más propensos al contagio y cuáles más susceptibles de transmitir la enfermedad. La evidencia más clara permite establecer que el grupo más vulnerable son los adultos mayores que padecen de prexistencias como diabetes, hipertensión, dislipidemias e incluso sobrepeso y obesidad. Los datos disponibles hasta el momento han abierto el debate sobre si los niños son en realidad ""peligrosamente transmisores"" como se afirmó en un principio 9 .El gobierno anunció para el mes de septiembre la reapertura de escuelas, colegios y universidades con estrictas medidas sanitarias de seguridad. Entonces se abre una nueva polémica sobre si fue conveniente el cierre y su real impacto sobre la mitigación del contagio por el COVID-19 y sobre la conveniencia de la apertura con las numerosas restricciones y con una comunidad de padres que ha estado sometida a un inusitado cúmulo de información contradictoria, en la mayoría de los casos, que ha exacerbado los comportamientos de temor, miedo y pánico ante la eventual posibilidad de un niño contagiado en el entorno educativo 10, 11 .Adicionalmente muchos padres de familia se debaten en la realidad social de tener que volver en algún momento a su entorno laboral y no encontrar la manera de dejar a sus hijos bajo un cuidado seguro. Muchos niños son hijos de padres que no pueden teletrabajar y que obligatoriamente deberán reincorporarse a sus escenarios de trabajo y otros tantos adolecen de recursos tecnológicos para estudiar en las modalidades virtuales.Es una realidad difícil de abordar sobre la cual se cierne un escenario de incertidumbre, por esa razón desde la Asociación de Medicina del Deporte y la Fundación Colombiana del Corazón quisimos contribuir con los resultados de esta encuesta a generar insumos que permitan explorar alternativas que hagan posible reducir el impacto del aislamiento obligatorio en los niños de Colombia.Para evaluar el impacto del confinamiento en la actividad física diaria y el peso de los niños en Colombia durante el confinamiento se diseñó un instrumento tipo encuesta.Primero formulamos algunos interrogantes para definir los objetivos. Estas fueron las preguntas formuladas y las respuestas iniciales:• ¿Qué esperamos aprender de esta encuesta? R: Tener un conocimiento sobre el comportamiento de los niños durante el período de confinamiento obligatorio decidido por el Gobierno.• ¿A quiénes queremos entrevistar? R: A los padres de familia que de manera libre decidan contestar la encuesta.• ¿De qué manera nos ayudará la información obtenida para aportar al debate sobre la conveniencia de aislar a los niños y adolescentes por el peligro de contagio por COVID-19? R: Los resultados de la encuesta permitirán generar un muestreo sobre el comportamiento de los niños durante la cuarentena para aportar datos sujetos a un análisis objetivo.Tras definir los objetivos, se diseñó un formulario de encuesta dirigido a padres de familia, el cual fue dispuesto en la plataforma de encuestas de Google, donde se cargó un formulario receptivo, fácil de diligenciar y susceptible de responder a través de cualquier medio digital computador (PC), tableta o celular. La encuesta se distribuyó en las bases de datos de la Asociación de Medicina del Deporte y la Fundación Colombiana del Corazón, utilizando para su difusión las redes sociales: WhatsApp y correo electrónico.El formulario fue diseñado con la metodología de la encuesta de comportamiento, en la cual se solicitó a los padres de familia responder preguntas acerca de los comportamientos de los niños durante el período de aislamiento preventivo obligatorio generado por la amenaza del contagio por COVID-19 12 .Las encuestas de comportamiento se enfocan en lo que las personas hacen y las preguntas se diseñan con respuestas de selección. Son preguntas precisas para que los padres puedan informar sobre el comportamiento de sus hijos. Consecuentemente, las respuestas se consideran un auto reporte de la realidad que observan e interpretan los padres de sus hijos. Esto significa que los resultados obtenidos parten de una consideración subjetiva de acciones individuales, lo cual no disminuye su valor, pues se trata de una realidad que emana de las encuestas de comportamiento y que se tuvo en cuenta en el análisis de los datos. Diseñamos un cuestionario de 5 preguntas con 5 opciones de respuesta, el cual se define como un cuestionario de datos continuos, tras confirmar que las preguntas seleccionadas recogen la información de interés pretendida en función de los objetivos de la investigación.Es de resaltar que esta escala de pocos ítems tiene características que favorecen que la fiabilidad sea alta como la definición simple del rasgo a medir y la diversidad de las edades de los niños y adolescentes evaluados.Las respuestas a las 5 preguntas formuladas les pidieron a los padres de familia evaluar las actividades de sus hijos. Cada pregunta con 5 opciones de respuesta: La medición y construcción de los índices y escalas en la tabulación se estructuró codificando el porcentaje de respuestas para cada ítem ofrecido.La metodología de medición fue la de sumar cada selección y traducirla a porcentajes a partir de considerar el 100% del total de las respuestas para distribuirlas porcentualmente en cada una de las 5 propuestas.Tamaño de la muestra: Dado que la encuesta planteó comprender los comportamientos de la población general, en este caso, y quienes respondieron lo hicieron de manera voluntaria, ellos constituyen la población de muestreo. En Colombia, a partir de datos generados por el DANE, un numero de 7 millones de personas tienen hijos entre 1 mes y 17 años, que son el objeto de esta investigación 13 . Para que la muestra tenga un nivel de confianza aceptable decidimos un margen de error inferior al 5%, con lo cual la muestra por millón de personas debe aproximarse a 150 formularios, lo cual da un total de 1.050 respuestas mínimas para garantizar la confianza de los resultados.De esta forma se distribuyeron un número de 10 mil encuestas para alcanzar un índice de respuestas del 10% que garantizara llegar a completar las 1.050 de la muestra.En total fueron verificadas 1139 encuestas.Este tipo de muestra es válida como estudio piloto, lo cual quiere decir que los resultados y su respectivo análisis no tiene un carácter definitivo y sus limitaciones están especialmente circunscritas a la realidad socioeconómica de la muestra y a la localización geográfica de los encuestados, quienes en una amplia mayoría se encuentran en ciudades capitales.Se analizaron los resultados pregunta por pregunta para una mejor comprensión.Pregunta No. 1 Edad de su hijo: La mayoría de las respuestas fueron de padres que tienen a sus hijos en edades entre 4 y 12 años, pues al sumar las opciones de 4 a 7 y de 8 a 12 entrega como resultado un 56.8%, ocupando el primer lugar de respuestas el rango comprendido entre 8 y 12 años con un 30.7%.Pregunta No. 2 ¿Cuántos minutos por día de actividad física en casa realiza?: todas las recomendaciones han llegado a la conclusión que es imprescindible que los jóvenes en edad escolar (de 6 a 17 años) inviertan 60 minutos o más cada día en actividades físicas de moderadas a vigorosas porque tienen beneficios sustanciales para la salud. Precisan las recomendaciones que deben combinarse actividades aeróbicas con ejercicios de fortalecimiento óseo y muscular 15 .La encuesta permitió establecer que el 13% de los padres reportan que sus hijos superaron los 60 minutos recomendados, en tanto que más de un 30% aceptan que no lograron llegar a 30 minutos, que es la mitad del tiempo recomendado.Una importante mayoría de 75.2% afirmó que sus hijos no llegaron al mínimo recomendado, siendo la cifra más concluyente del análisis de la segunda pregunta del cuestionario. Para la Academia Americana de Pediatría los menores de 2 años nunca deberían estar expuestos a las pantallas ni móviles, ni tabletas, ni televisiones, ni siquiera para comer. En esta edad es cuando el cerebro del niño crece más rápidamente, y ellos necesitan el contacto directo con las personas. Con un dispositivo digital el bebé no aprende a hablar, no aprende a comunicarse y tiene un efecto para su capacidad de aprendizaje.Precisa la Academia Americana de Pediatría, que entre los 2 y los 5 años, el tiempo máximo de dispositivos móviles no debe superar los 30 minutos al día, siempre bajo la supervisión de un adulto para explicar el contenido 17 .Pregunta No. 4 ¿Cuántas horas duerme en la noche?: los resultados relacionados con las horas de sueño que acumulan los niños, reveló que el 58.9%, quiere decir la mayoría, duermen de 9 a 10 horas, que es el tiempo recomendado de sueño.Es de anotar, no obstante, que como se preguntó por las horas de la noche de manera específica, es probable que los padres hayan omitido las siestas.Las pautas o directrices para el sueño en la infancia según la American Academy of Sleep Medicine, AASM (Academia Estadounidense de la Medicina del Sueño) sostiene que las horas de sueño por día (incluidas siestas o períodos del sueño en el día), deben ser las siguientes:1. Bebés: 4 a 12 meses 12 a 16 horas 2. Niños pequeños: 1 a 2 años 11 a 14 horas 3. Edad preescolar: 3 a 5 años 10 a 13 horas 4. Edad escolar: 6 a 12 años 9 a 12 horas 5. Adolescentes: 13 a 18 años 8 a 10 horas 19Pregunta No. 5 ¿El peso corporal de su hijo(a) se ha elevado? ¿Cuánto?: si bien más de la mitad de los encuestados, 50.2%, precisó que sus hijos mantuvieron su peso, esta pregunta es de las 5 solicitadas, la que entrega menos confiabilidad, pues para determinar la realidad es necesario disponer en el hogar de una báscula para realizar el seguimiento.No obstante, los padres que aceptaron que sus hijos se subieron entre 1 y 3 kilos durante el período de aislamiento, llegó al 44%. Concluimos, por tanto, que el 44% de los niños en edad escolar, especialmente, aumentaron de peso durante los días de confinamiento.Una combinación de inactividad física con comportamientos sedentarios tiene como consecuencia inevitable el aumento de peso.Alrededor del mundo se vienen realizando varias investigaciones para establecer el impacto que las cuarentenas han tenido en los niños y adolescentes. La metodología aplicada con una encuesta de comportamiento es una buena forma de obtener una muestra representativa de una realidad auto reportada, y si bien no se tomaron como ejemplo encuestas previas soportadas en evidencia de aplicación y no admite contraste con otras similares, como insumo para el análisis de las realidades que han vivido los niños durante el período del aislamiento obligatorio preventivo es de un inobjetable valor al confirmar, con cifras claras, algunas de las conclusiones que se dan como verdaderas sin que estén soportadas en una medición.Los resultados obtenidos son producto de una tabulación en porcentajes de las cinco opciones brindadas en cada pregunta.El cuestionario aplicado tiene limitaciones especialmente en la pregunta 5, pues la respuesta está mediada por la percepción del peso que los padres observan en sus hijos, pues no se puede tener la seguridad de que realizaron la medida en una báscula para establecer la realidad.No obstante, cada uno de los datos obtenidos son concluyentes y rotundos, especialmente en el evidente incremento de las actividades sedentarias y el decrecimiento de la actividad física en los niños como consecuencia del confinamiento.Los resultados y su interpretación se convierten en un insumo destacado para continuar los estudios e investigaciones sobre las consecuencias de las determinaciones gubernamentales ante la llegada del nuevo coronavirus COVID-19 en la población de niños y adolescentes en Colombia.Es importante señalar respecto de la edad de quienes más respondieron la encuesta, que en estos rangos de edades se encuentran los niños en crecimiento con edad escolar entre 6 y 12 años, justamente la edad que significa un mayor reto para los padres de familia, pues es el momento en que se inicia de lleno la formación en la escuela o colegio de las principales características del relacionamiento con otros niños, el gusto por los juegos y las actividades deportivas, la interacción y la cercanía con sus padres 14 .Es justamente en estas edades donde los padres se confrontan sobre los aciertos y desaciertos en la formación y la manera cómo el entorno empieza a impactar de manera muy significativa en los niños como elemento pedagógico complementario de los principios esenciales de formación entregados en el hogar en la primera infancia, ubicada en los rangos de edad de 0 a 5 años.En la edad escolar, de 6 a 12 años es cuando se forman las principales características de la disciplina, el respeto por la autoridad, la responsabilidad sobre sí mismos y su cuidado y se definen límites, lineamientos y expectativas, pero especialmente es cuando se empiezan a manifestar señales claras de una creciente independencia y podrían comenzar los cambios físicos de la pubertad, especialmente en las niñas.Son justamente los padres de hijos de este rango de edad quienes están más atentos a participar de este tipo de cuestionarios porque son los que con mayor interés quieren conocer elementos que aporten al proceso formativo en el que se encuentran.La menor participación es de padres de hijos de 0 a 12 meses, justamente porque la demanda de los niños en esos momentos está asociada al afecto y al amor con el mayor escenario de dependencia de sus padres y con un impacto mínimo del entorno.La niñez y la adolescencia son períodos críticos para el desarrollo de habilidades para el movimiento y para aprender conductas saludables orientadas a establecer la base de la salud del futuro adulto, así como la perfección del bienestar asociado a estilos de vida que prioricen los comportamientos orientados al cuidado.Si la actividad física en niños y adolescentes promueve la salud y el estado físico, este período de cuarentena, superior a los 150 días, dejará en los niños al salir del confinamiento una menor aptitud cardiorrespiratoria y con músculos menos fuertes, entre otras consecuencias.De la misma forma, y como secuela, puede traducirse en un aprendizaje negativo de comportamientos sedentarios, de acumular más tiempo de ocio improductivo y de perder contacto con la naturaleza y el medio ambiente.Sumando a lo anterior, es esencial tener en cuenta que la práctica regular de actividad física, que supere los 60 minutos diarios, tiene para los jóvenes en edad escolar beneficios de invaluable impacto para su cerebro, que incluyen mejora cognoscitiva, estímulo de las funciones de la memoria, velocidad de procesamiento, mejor capacidad de atención y aventajado rendimiento académico 16 .Para la edad escolar (6-12 años), quienes mayoritariamente respondieron la encuesta, sostiene la Academia Americana de Pediatría, que ese tiempo no debe superar 60 minutos al día y señala que más tiempo favorecen el sedentarismo y la obesidad.El período de aislamiento puede favorecer de manera significativa los comportamientos sedentarios con menos actividad física y más tiempo dedicado a los dispositivos móviles, como consecuencia podríamos tener más jóvenes familiarizados con el control de un joystick que lanzando una pelota.El '' producto '' del aislamiento puede traer como consecuencia niños más débiles, más lentos y pesados comparados con ellos mismos antes de iniciarse la coyuntura sanitaria y se va a evidenciar lo que se conoce como la tríada de inactividad pediátrica (PIT) con trastorno de déficit de ejercicio, dinapenia pediátrica y analfabetismo físico 18 .Es importante tener que cuenta que los niños crecen mejor si tienen una rutina nocturna habitual. No acumular las horas de sueño diarias puede desembocar en problemas del comportamiento, de salud y de control de emociones como irritabilidad, dificultad para concentrarse, hipertensión, obesidad, dolores de cabeza y depresión. Los niños que duermen bien lograr tener un sistema inmunitario más sano, que tiene como consecuencia un mejor rendimiento académico, comportamiento, memoria y salud mental.El confinamiento en niños, sin una estrategia sobre la actividad física y sobre la alimentación balanceada, produce sobrepeso y obesidad En nuestro estudio el período de aislamiento obligatorio produjo que el 75.2% de los niños no lograran sumar los minutos recomendados de actividad física, que el 82.8 % superaran el tiempo de 60 minutos recomendados diariamente frente a dispositivos electrónicos y que el 44 % se subiera de peso.La encuesta tuvo un importante nivel de confianza, exploró la realidad del comportamiento de los niños durante el período de cuarentena que completó en Colombia 162 días y permitió obtener resultados que pueden convertirse en indicadores para el diseño de estrategias orientadas a lograr que los niños puedan tener acceso a mejores oportunidades de formación, conocimiento y formación sobre la importancia de incluir comportamientos de cuidado en su entorno, lo cual implica generar procesos pedagógicos orientadores para padres de familia y profesores, de manera que se logre inducir a los niños desde la infancia en la importancia de incluir conductas saludables en su vida cotidiana.Se requiere elaborar estrategias educativas que acompañen la realización de actividad física y dietas balanceadas para que en tiempo de aislamiento obligatorio los niños puedan prevenir el aumento de peso.Desde los entornos educativos se debe priorizar la apropiación de estilos de vida para el cuidado de la salud de manera que se posible sembrar en los niños conductas saludables que puedan mantenerse en su futura edad adulta.",Colombia,first author,2020-09-29,9
513bd717eac26c3a5c6c912832bb375473660cbe,Title: Gender disparities in access to care for time-sensitive conditions during COVID- 19 pandemic in Chile,"Reports of a decrease in healthcare access were common during the pandemic for cardiovascular and oncologic diseases in various countries. Only three studies explored gender differences in access to healthcare for time-sensitive conditions. These studies did not find a differential impact between genders. None of these studies were conducted in settings with higher levels of gender inequalities such as Latin America.To our knowledge, this is the first study in Latin America that explores gender differences in access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic. We confirmed a large decrease in medical diagnosis in women compared to men for a broad group of time-sensitive cardiovascular and oncologic diseases. We used a comprehensive and reliable national database to test our hypothesis. The effect was evident in conditions with different etiological mechanisms, so it is highly implausible to explain our finding through biological causes. Gender norms and hierarchies better explain this wide effect. An increase in care workload due to school closure and aggravation of gender bias due to scarcity could explain this reduced healthcare utilisation in women during the pandemic.Our findings should alert policy-makers about the urgent need to integrate a gender perspective on the current outbreak response. If school closure has a role in the observed differential effect, increasing healthcare services availability will not shorten disparities between sexes. Services provision should enhance access during COVID-19 pandemic, especially for women who are raising children or have other caregiver responsibilities.The COVID-19 pandemic reduced the utilisation of health care services, similarly to the phenomena reported in previous epidemic outbreaks, like SARS, 1 MERS, 2 and Ebola. 3 In the current pandemic, studies have shown a decrease in the frequency of different interventions like surgeries (electives or not) and hospital admissions, including specific time-sensitive conditions, such as acute coronary syndrome, 4,5 myocardial infarction, 6,7 stroke, 7-11 and cancer. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Although it has been largely studied that gender impacts access to healthcare, gender and sex differences in access to healthcare have been scarcely examined during the COVID-19pandemic. While most studies have not explored heterogeneity of the reduction by gender, 4, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] some studies that examine differences by sex on acute coronary syndrome 5, 6 and stroke, 8 have not found relevant disparities. Only one study was done in Latin America and did not explore gender differences. 11 To our knowledge, a single research explored access differences in cancer care by sex during a pandemic. The authors did not identify any relevant differences, although the more considerable decrease was for breast cancer. 17 Gender has been proposed as a structural determinant of health, as gender norms shape social stratification, health-related exposures and behaviours, healthcare access, health systems, and health research. 18 Nevertheless, the response to outbreaks has been usually devoid of a gender perspective, limiting the effectiveness of the public health response 19, 20 .The sex-gender system is difficult to separate for analysis. In this study, we state that the measured differences in access to healthcare are explained mainly to gender norms. First, because the role of gender in access to healthcare has been previously studied as a relevant factor. 18 Second, because it seems less plausible that the variations between men and women in the utilisation before and after the pandemic are due to biological characteristics. Therefore, hereafter the paper refers to ""gender"" for the studied categories of female and male.During a pandemic, people have massively delayed their consultation due to fear of contagion and reduced availability of medical services. Additionally, we pose that women were differentially affected in the outbreak response due to gender-roles. This study aims to evaluate disparities in access to care in Chile during the COVID-19 pandemic from a genderbased perspective. We focus on severe and time-sensitive group conditions (cardiovascular diseases and cancer) with guaranteed access in the context of the Chilean health system.In 2005 Chile implemented a Health Reform which included the National Explicit Health Guarantees Regime (""AUGE""), a set of guarantees aimed to ensure access to timely (opportunity guarantee), affordable, and quality services for people of both insurance systems predominant in Chile (public, National Health Fund -FONASA-, and private, ISAPRES), for 56 health conditions, which have been amplified to 80 nowadays. 24 During the current pandemic, the obligation for FONASA and ISAPRES to comply with the Explicit Guarantee of opportunity established for the health problems was suspended for up to one month since the 8th of April, except for severe conditions included in this study such as acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and cancers.We obtained data from the National Health Fund (Fondo Nacional de Salud -FONASA) which finances all public hospitals in Chile and provides health coverage to nearly 15 million inhabitants (75% of the Chilean population). We selected a set of nine time-sensitive conditions included in the National Explicit Health Guarantees Regime (""AUGE""): two acute cardiovascular diseases (stroke and myocardial infarction) and seven cancers (gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, lymphoma, leukaemia, cervical cancer, breast cancer, and testis cancer).The attending physician registers every public insured patient with a medical diagnosis of these conditions as a confirmed case. National clinical guidelines standardise the diagnostic process for each disease, reducing practice variation and improving reporting quality. A confirmed case report is mandatory by law for healthcare providers. A description of case definitions included in National Clinical Guidelines is available in the Supplemental material (Table S1) .The outcome variable was the number of confirmed cases for the following diseases: stroke (includes transient ischemic attack), myocardial infarction, all cardiovascular diseases (stroke plus myocardial infarction), gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, lymphoma, leukaemia, cervical cancer (includes dysplasia), breast cancer, testis cancer, and all cancers. The independent variables were difference-in-differences estimators and age (20 to 29 years, 30 to 39 years, 40 to 49 years, 50 to 59 years, 60 to 69 years, 70 to 79 years, 80 years, and more). We used as exposure or offset variable the number of persons covered by the national public health insurance by age group to adjust for size and demographic composition. Also, we adjusted for weekly and yearly seasonal trends. The model was defined as:the population (number) of public health beneficiaries by age-group and sex, ߚ To test for heterogeneity by sex, our main effect of interest, we included an interaction term between DID and sex (Model 2). As a sensitivity analysis, we fitted unadjusted and adjusted models for all cancers, after excluding sex-specific cancers (breast cancer, cervical cancer, and testicular).We reported the mean and standard deviation for descriptive analysis and incidence rate ratios (IRR) and absolute effects (counts) with 95% confidence intervals for regressions models. We used STATA 16.0 for analyses and R 4.0.2 for graphs.Since this study used secondary data from publicly available sources collected by the Ministry of Health, which are registered anonymously, we did not require institutional review board approval.The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. All authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.A differential impact, with larger effects on women than men, was observed across cardiovascular and oncological diseases. For the former, a 11% (IRR 0·89; 95% CI 0·86-0·92) additional reduction in access for major cardiovascular events in women compared with men was observable. For the latter, a further 24% reduction (0·76; 95% CI 0·67-0·86) in access to newly diagnosed cancers among females compared with males was evident in the pandemic period. In the sensitivity analysis, differences between sexes in the cancer group persisted after excluding sex-specific cancers such as breast, cervical, and testicular cancers. In this analysis, a bigger impact on access was observable among women (IRR 0·81 IC95% 0·72-0·91) ( Table 2) .When analysed by specific cardiovascular diseases, a greater decrease in women than men took place for stroke (IRR 0·88; 95% CI 0·82-0·93) and myocardial infarction (0·89; 95% CI 0·85-0·93). When analysed by specific oncologic diseases, a greater decrease in women than men occurred for colorectal cancer (IRR 0·79; 95% CI 0·69-0·91). Also, a greater reduction on cervical cancer (IRR 0·33; 95% CI 0·30-0·37) and breast cancer (IRR 0·37; 95% CI 0·37-0·43) compared to testicular cancer (IRR 0·5; 95% CI 0·38-0·65) was observed ( Myocardial infarction 0·62 (0·60-0·64) 0·89 (0·85-0·93) All cancer 0·56 (0·50-0·63) 0·76 (0·67-0·86) All cancer (excluding sex specific cancer)In our study, we confirmed a large drop in the medical diagnosis for time-sensitive conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. This decrease was more significant for oncologic than cardiovascular diseases. Also, we confirmed our hypothesis of gender disparities in medical diagnosis. A large group of time-sensitive conditions were affected by this differential effect, even though healthcare access for these conditions is guaranteed by law to everyone. This finding is worrisome because delaying care for these severe conditions can lead to long-term disability and -eventually -premature death.Gender is a structural determinant of health 18 and, usually, is not prioritised during an outbreak response. 19, 20 Through different mechanisms, gender could affect healthcare access in a pandemic. Nevertheless, differential access by gender has not been adequately studied during this current outbreak. Only a few studies explored heterogeneity by sex in cardiovascular 5,6,8 and cancer care 17 without finding any significant effect. None of these studies were done in Latin America.Gender norms and hierarchies could explain better this wide effect. Differences in helpseeking behaviour between genders have been commonly described. 29 On average, Chilean women used more healthcare services than men. 30 During COVID-19, school closure to control disease transmission has a differential effect on women because they provide most of the informal care in families. 19 ,20 A greater differential effect was observed on diseases (colorectal, cervical, gastric, and breast cancer) that require scheduled appointments for testing. Added to income reduction due to work hours decrease 22 and unemployment, 23 an increase in domestic workload can decrease women's time availability and reduce healthcare demand during a pandemic.From the supply side, gender biases 18 -heuristics based on gender stereotypes -have been associated with delayed access to cardiovascular treatment in women. 28 Potentially, these biases could aggravate during the pandemic. Service offering reduction could promote severe disease prioritisation by medical teams, which could unintentionally reduce healthcare access for women. For instance, in the context of scarcity, the treatment for only the standard male could be prioritised.This study has several limitations. First, we use administrative data, which might be subject to underreporting during the pandemic. Nevertheless, confirmed case reports have been mandatory for healthcare providers since 2004. Moreover, they are used for health claim payments in the Chilean health system, therefore making it less likely that reduced reporting could explain the observed effect. Second, due to the data codification, this study only considers two categories for sex and gender (female and male). This dichotomy excludes a spectrum of gender identities and the intersex population. 18 Future studies must explore differential effects on health care accessibility during pandemics for a broader gender classification. Third, we cannot rule out residual confounding in the context of observational data. Nevertheless, due to the characteristic of the exposure of interest (the pandemic) is unlikely that better data could be obtained using alternative sources or study designs. We controlled confirmed cases by population and age in our models and included seasonal adjustments by week and year to control for unobserved time-specific confounding factors.As strengths, this is the first study from Latin America that explores access by sex to medical diagnosis during the COVID-19 pandemic. To test our hypothesis, we used a rich, comprehensive, and reliable national database where cases were defined based on standardised diagnostic processes. We select a variety of severe time-sensitive conditions to avoid generalisation based on anecdotal evidence. Moreover, we tested different models, maintaining our conclusions unchanged.As previous researchers have posed, 19, 20 our findings should alert policy-makers about the urgent need to integrate a gender perspective into an outbreak response. If school closure has a role in the observed differential effect, increasing healthcare services availability will not shorten disparities between sexes. Services provision should enhance access, especially for women who are raising children or have other caregiver responsibilities and reduce economic barriers. Also, health professionals should be aware of this situation and encouraged through clinical guidelines to reduce current gender bias in their clinical practice.Future research must evaluate the consequences of access reductions on disability and premature death. The observed effect occurred in a set of severe time-sensitive conditions where care delays could worsen prognosis. Additionally, we need to know the causes, which could be informed through surveys and innovative ways to provide care for these diseases during the actual pandemic.In conclusion, as previous studies have shown, 4-17 we confirmed a large drop in medical diagnosis for cardiovascular and oncologic conditions in Chile during COVID-19 pandemic.Additionally, we demonstrate that women were far more affected compared to men. This differential effect by gender was observed for a broad group of time-sensitive conditions. Because these conditions have different etiological mechanisms, biological causes are unlikely to explain our findings. Gender norms and hierarchies define better this differential effect. Emergent healthcare barriers, such as an increase in care work due to school closure, aggravation of gender bias, and income reduction could decrease healthcare access in women during pandemics and potentially cause long-term disability and premature death in them. Our study should alert policymakers and put women's access to healthcare as a top global health priority during this pandemic. ",Chile,abstract,2020-09-11,9
c7d2282a91c053929385a87b4ab7bf7125b1a21f,Modeling COVID-19 as a National Dynamics with a SARS-CoV-2 Prevalent Variant: Brazil -A Study Case,"The SARS-Cov-2 has revealed important facts about governments, and health organizations world wise. This powerful new virus demonstrates that national health organizations are incapable of prompt responding to such an emergency. Reasons why a central government cannot cope to this crisis are many 1 . Infectious disease outbreaks show how countries are all tied. To deal with Covid-19 countries must work together on a collectively and coherent response strategy to drive the infection to a low level. Developing and emerging countries are particularly vulnerable by the pandemic. In such countries it is difficult to sustain social distancing measures. Some reasons are: their weak defenses, health systems are often poor, governments have fewer resources to intervene, and a significant fraction of the population has no savings and depend on daily sources of income 1 . COVID-19 was first reported in Brazil in February 2020 -EPI week # 9. One semester latter, the country became one of the worst affected globally. Brazil comprises many states with vulnerable communities, and a relatively weak social protection system. After six months from the first reported case, the number of confirmed cases and deaths crossed 3.9 million and 120 thousand, respectively. Facts that rise doubts on the availability of public health care for the sections of society that cannot afford private care 2 . Since the start of the epidemic in Brazil, several types of Non-pharmaceutical Interventions -NPI have been adopted with varied success by the country's 27 federal units and 5,596 municipalities. Virus transmission has dropped substantially in most units. However, by September 2020, the estimated reproduction number remains above the unit 3 . Thus, only mitigation (and not suppression) of the epidemic has been achieved so far. Current interventions remain insufficient to extinguish virus transmission in Brazil. Closer surveillance of viral transmission quantifying the impact of different control measures on transmission may help to minimize future infections. Moreover, continued monitoring of the genetic diversity of the virus lineages circulating globally became necessary. As recently suggested, virus diversity are of prime importance in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission 4, 5 . While the COVID-19 pandemic continues in the Americas, new highlights into the Brazilian are: the high SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the country; the role of its large urban centers; the lack of simultaneous lockdown regions; the non-equitable access to tests and reports. Those factors potentially contributed to sustain pandemic spread. By the end of February 2020, before the implementation of NPIs and travel bans, different SARS-Cov-2 lineages had emerged in Brazil from Europe 6 . In the beginning, the epidemic had spread mostly locally and within-state borders 6 .The present study aims to derive a consistent and quantified model on the COVID-19 outbreak as a national dynamics, presenting Brazil as a study case. The major results are obtained applying an adaptation of a well known epidemiological model on official published data. Epidemiological models are commonly stochastic, network-based, spatially diffusive, using meta-population approaches 7, 8, 9 . However, the parameters of dynamic deterministic models are directly related to interpretable physical processes 10 . As a drawback, deterministic models impose restrictive analysis, once the dynamics of the host population and the virus are not deterministic. The population has free will, and the virus undergoes favorable mutations upon natural selection 5 . Host dynamics was account for into the model by spreading the use of time-varying reproduction number 11 . Regarding the pathogen, the variant SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutation 5 , which became globally proposed as dominant, was incorporated in our model. In short, the methodology employed is the application of an adaptation to the deterministic SEIR Model, which takes into account two lineages of the SARS-CoV-2, and a time-varying reproduction number to account for changes in the dynamics of the COVID-19 transmission behavior. Such a methodology can be applied worldwide to predict forecasts of the outbreak in any infected country.Even though SARS-CoV-2 sequence diversity is reported to be low, natural selection acts upon favorable mutations 12 . The persistence of the pandemic might enable accumulation of immunologically relevant mutations. Recent identification of spike amino acid variant has been reported which increasing frequency globally 5 but not necessarily brings evidence of positive selection for 614G 13 .The spike protein determines the infectivity of the virus, and its transmissibility in the host. Mutations in the gene encoding Spike (S) protein are being reported since SARS-CoV-2 was identified in humans. Those mutations of S proteins affect viral life cycle and its interaction with the host. Very recent studies suggest that the observed increased transmission reported in Europe and Americas may be associated with the most dominant variant 5 . Those authors present experimental evidence that the so called D614G spike variant is associated with greater infectivity as well as higher viral loads. Global tracking data show that the G614 variant in Spike has spread faster than D614 comparing two time periods apart by a 2-week gap. The fraction for South America prior to March 1 st are D = 38%, G = 62%, and D = 4 %, G = 96% in the period March 2020 21-30. They also show running weekly average counts of sampled sequences exhibiting the D614 and G614 variants for South America between January 12 and May 12. The results are explained assuming the virus being more infectious. On the other hand, the authors did not find evidence of G614 effects on disease severity. As recently reported elsewhere, the Spike protein 614 polymorphism has little variance in growth rates among clusters and presented no significant difference in initial growth rates 13 . Those facts are incorporated in our model and evidences are demonstrated, assuming the same time-varying R t number for both Spike protein 614 morphisms 13 .The deadly face of COVID-19, which by the end of September 2020 had claimed more than 866 000 lives worldwide, is not the only face. SARS-CoV-2 has a dual nature: tragically lethal to many persons and surprisingly harmless to others. Infected persons who remain asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic (here on named non-symptomatic) play a significant role in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The absence symptoms in persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 does not mean an absence of harm. The procedure to classify non-symptomatic hosts is to carry repeated observations of the individual over time in a group of individuals sharing a statistical factor. Therefore, the prevalence of non-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection has to be included in modeling any COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Applying statistical analysis on recent published and reliable data 14 , the percentage value of non-symptomatic and symptomatic hosts were estimated to be respectively (54 +/-9) % and (46 +/-9) %.There are two measures used to assess the proportion of infected individuals with fatal outcomes, the infection fatality ratio (IFR), which estimates this proportion of deaths among all infected individuals, and case fatality ratio (CFR), which estimates this proportion of deaths among identified confirmed cases. The level of transmission is generally underestimated for infectious diseases, which difficulty the IFR estimative 19 . A significant proportion of infected people are undetected because they are non-symptomatic, and fail to present at healthcare facilities. Furthermore, testing capacity have been limited in Brazil, and restricted to people with severe cases and priority risk groups. To accurately measure IFR, the complete number of infections, and deaths caused by the disease must be known. An important method to estimate the true number of infected individuals is the serological testing of a representative random sample of the population to detect evidence of exposure to a pathogen. Very recently, a careful evaluation of the IFR was reported to the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil 20 . A country-wide average IFR of 1.05% (95% CI: 0.96 -1.17%) was reported by the authors. On the other hand, reliable CFRs are generally obtained at the end of an outbreak, after most infected individuals either died or recovered. CFR calculated using the above relation during ongoing epidemics is influenced by lags in report dates for cases and deaths. Obtaining both IFR and CFR from available data would allow estimating the fraction of symptomatic hosts to apply in the model.Epidemiological models are useful in estimating main parameters of a pathogen spread like SARS-CoV-2. Mathematically, such models may evaluate the efficacy of specific interventions, identify efficient strategies, and forecast future scenarios 21 . Models provide estimative on the basic and effective reproduction numbers, i.e., the number of new infections caused by each infectious individual, the case fatality ratio (CFR), which estimates this proportion of deaths among identified confirmed cases. They also may quantify the infection fatality ratio (IFR), clarifying ambiguities create by asymptomatic infected hosts and delays between incubation, infection and heal/death. Important to note that official reported confirmed COVID-19 cases may miss asymptomatic infections, which can bias estimates of disease severity and IFR, so epidemiological models could help reduce this uncertainty. The Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed -SEIR model was adapted in this study to take into account the original SARS-Cov-2 D-form and its dominant G-variant with their own incubation rates, a pre-estimated fraction of symptomatic hosts, and a pre-inferred time-varying reproduction number. COVID-19 has a latent or incubation period, during which the individual is said to be infected but not infectious. Members of this population in latent stage are labeled as Exposed (but not infectious). Taken into consideration the original SARS-Cov-2 D-form and its dominant G-variant labeled as D and G, the deterministic model with the groups: Susceptible, Exposed (D and G), Infected (D and G), and Removed (recovered and deaths/fatalities) is labeled as the SE D E G I D I G R Model. The number of fatalities is assumed dependent on the confirmed COVID-19 cases (Infected D and G). This dependence is not linear neither monotonic, and is obtained from official reported cumulative values. COVID-19 cases in Brazil are reported by public health and private services, and interrelated on a website which summarizes daily the aggregated counts. 22 Worth to mention that by the time this study was conducted, reliable estimative on the number of sub notifications and information on the number of nonsymptomatic were unreliable. Under those assumptions, the set of ordinary differential equations -ODE governing our SE D E G I D I G R model follows;(1)is the removed rate that infected individuals (symptomatic and non-symptomatic) recover, leaving the infected groups I D (t) and I G (t). The accumulated SARS-Cov-2 confirmed cases are obtained from:where is the estimated fraction of symptomatic individuals. Major assumptions for this model are:and are respectively the incubation rates for D and G SARS-CoV-2 exposed hosts. It is assumed that both D and G groups share the same R(t) time dependence. In short, N, and are the only fitting parameters to data. The susceptible number N=60 x 10 6 (28.7% of the Brazilian population) is chosen as the minimum number of susceptible to account for the accumulated confirmed cases in the study period. Fatalities were modeled as a function of the confirmed cases C(t), and this dependence, obtained from official reported cases and deaths, is not linear neither monotonic as discussed latter.Official data, from February 25 th to August 19 th , 2020 EPI week #9, provided by the Ministry of Health of Brazil 22 , was considered to estimate part of the parameters that govern the dynamics established by Eqns.The complete estimated sequence of R(t) values as well as its Credible Intervals (5 -95%) in Fig. 1 where time is shown in units of EPI weeks. An epidemiological week, commonly referred to as an EPI week is simply a standardized method of counting weeks to allow for the comparison of data year after year. Timevarying R(t) describes COVID-19 time shifts incidence. Rapid epidemic growth phases are associated with R(t) values higher than 2. In contrast, epidemic decline phases may be characterized by 2 > R > 1. The beginning of the pandemic spread in Brazil presented, for a one-week time window, R-values larger than 2. However, after two weeks, R(t) shows a monotonic decline, reaching values 4% above the unit, as a consequence of collective acquired immunity and NPI regional interventions across de country (Fig.1) . NPIs in Brazil was implemented between EPI week #10 and #12 across the countries' 27 federal states, and consisted of social distancing, mask wearing, school, and stores closures. At the start of the epidemics, value of R o > 2 was reported in São Paulo concurrent with the timing of state mandatory NPIs 6, 16 . infectivity and higher viral loads is modeled by a higher (two fold) incubation rate  G as compared to  D . The fraction of symptomatic hosts within 95% credible interval was estimated comparing IFR to CFR reported values 20 . The estimated mean value and deviation are consistent with previous analysis. 14 Fatalities were modeled as a function of the confirmed cases C(t). By the end of 2020, the predicted numbers of confirmed cases in Brazil, within 95% credible intervals, may reach 6 Million (5 -7) and fatalities would accounts for 184 thousand (134 -218). The total number of infected individuals is estimated to reach (13 ± 1) Million, 6.2% of the population. 11 . Vertical bars represent 5 to 95% CRI. Data points for the last three weeks (Figure Inset -solid circles and triangles) were added after the model was complete, granting confidence on the outcomes.",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-27,9
56bb2e5a41fd5c4c012631f57bce47d87ac86477,Phylogenomics reveals multiple introductions and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 into Peru,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) is an emerging betacoronavirus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in December 2019 in Wuhan, China (1) . Since then, the virus rapidly spread across the globe and was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 (2) . Immediately, Peruvian government has carried out a series of sanitary interventions to prevent disease transmission including schools' closure (11 March 2020) , travel restrictions from Europe and Asia (12 March 2020) , country borders closure (16 March 2020) and nationwide curfew (18 March 2020) (3) . Despite these measures, SARS-CoV-2 has managed to rapidly spread causing over 702,776 cases and 30,236 deaths being the Lima city one of the major epicenters of SARS-CoV 2 infections in Peru, as of 11 September 2020 (4) . As consequence, Peru has become one of the countries with the highest mortality rate from the current COVID-19 pandemic, although it is likely because of increase of diagnostic capacity and reported cases compared to other countries. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly become publicly available to have revealed insights about the genome structure as well as the temporal evolution and global transmission of the virus (5) . However, the sources of epidemic transmission and genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in Peru to have led to the rapid spread of the virus remains poorly investigated.We analyzed a total of 3472 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, from which 149 ones were from Peru to investigate how this novel virus became established in the country and to dissect the spread of the one in this area, which will help to orientate effective prevention measures to control the COVID-19 epidemic Peru.Peru is one of the countries in the world with high levels of contagion and deaths by COVID-19 pandemic despite early national lockdown decreed by the government on 15 march when the country just had 71 cases reported. We sequenced 96 SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained from patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnostic up to July 04 at the National Institute of Health -Peru, yielding 87 high coverage-quality genomes. We removed 9 sequences with low coverage or too many private mutations/ambiguous sites indicative of sequencing error. These 87 cases were drawn from 7 Peru regions including Lima, Callao, Ancash, Lambayeque, Ica, Arequipa and Junin. Additionally, to these sequences, we have got 62 Peruvian SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID database getting a genomic dataset of 149 Peruvian isolates from 12 regions that cover a period from the first official case on 05 march until 04-July (Figure 2A ). Total Peruvian isolates were obtained from nasal and pharyngeal swab samples collected from 71 females (47.65%) and 78 (52.35%) males ranging in age between <25 years (14.37%), 25-35 years (17.36%), 36-46 years (22.65%), 47-59 years (21.56%), and >60 (24.06%) years.Ninety-four (63%) out of 149 Peruvian sequences were obtained from Lima Metropolitana, the Peruvian capital, and 10 genomes from Callao, a neighbor city of Lima Metropolitana, where the Jorge Chavez International Airport is located and the only one in the country with flights to and from Asia, Europe, and North America ( Figure 2A) . Moreover, Lima-Callao is considered the epicenter of Figure 1A ) to investigate early transmission event and genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in Peru. We found a strong temporal structure in our dataset by regressing genetic distance from tips to root in the ML tree against sample dates, resulting in a high correlation (r2 = 0.51) (Fig.   S1 ). ML phylodynamic analysis revealed that the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the analyzed full genomic data was 28 November 2019 (20 November 2019 to 14 December 2020, CI 90%) being the inferred ancestral root Asia. These observations are in line with the known epidemiology of the pandemic (5). Furthermore, the analysis of genomic data has shown that Peruvian isolates were widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree suggesting multiple, independent introductions, designed as nodes (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) with over 70% of statistical support from ML ( Figure 1A and Table 1 ). Similar to these introductions it has been reported in other countries such as Brazil (6), Colombia (7) and the USA (8) . The most of these putative introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Peru occurred between mid-February and early March, primarily sourced from Europe, Asia and South America (Table 1) . Interestingly, the COVID-19 pandemic reached Latin America in February 2020 expanding into the region until March 2020 when the COVID-19 incidence curve started to grow more rapidly (3).Peruvian isolates (57%) were mainly clustered with clade 20B. This clade is largely composed of isolates obtained from patients with COVID-19 in Europe (51%), suggesting that introductions from Europe account for the majority of cases found in Peru between February and early March 2020 ( Figure 1B and Table 1 ). Precisely, as of 12 March, 2020, the Ministry of Health reported imported cases in Lima from Spain, France and Italy (9) .We also identified within clade 20B, five putative introductions (node 1 to 5) where the most Peruvian isolates were interspersed without grouping by country or geographic region. Within this clade, we also identified SARS-CoV-2 Peruvian sequences that were reproduced in the time-scaled inference with mutations T1246I and G3278S in the ORF1a gene that distinguish clusters of sequences from Peru and elsewhere, suggesting a local transmission event that likely occurred in early March (tMRCA 95% CI: 27 February to 2 March) ( Table 1 , node 1, Figure 1A and Figure S1B ). Similar to isolates in the clade 20B, SARS-CoV-2 isolates positioned in the clade 20A were distributed throughout among isolates from multiple regions being mainly composed of European isolates (54%) ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ) that is line to earliest sequences observed at the base of this clade (France, Russia and Czech Republic). Thus, it is highly likely to be sourced of European origin.Within this clade, we also identified a Peruvian cluster which includes the first official COVID-19 case in Peru (Peru/INS-01-02) identified in Lima City on 5 March 2020 and with travel history to France, Spain and Czech Republic (9) . The SARS-Cov-2 sequence of this patient clustered with other Peruvian isolates (from 6-Mar to 04-July) conforming a ""Peruvian cluster"", all of which were closely related with European isolates confirming its likely origin (Figure 1 and Figure S1B ).The tMRCA of this cluster (node 10) was estimated to be 4 March (25 February to 4 March, 90% CI) and contains two specific amino acid substitution: H604Y in the ORF1b gene and I119V in the spike protein (Table 1) . What is more, within the cluster, we also observed 6 identical genomes to Peru/INS-01-02 reported in Lima until 17-March, suggesting local spread ( Figure 1C and Figure   S1B ). Interestingly, two identical sequences to Peru/INS-01-02 reported in Cuzco, in southern Peru, on 10-March were identified, suggesting a regional introduction of SARS-CoV-2 derived from the first case from Lima ( Figure 1C and Figure S1B ). Although by March 18 had nationwide curfew, phylogenomic analysis revealed cases derived from the ""Peruvian cluster"" reported between April and July to Lima, Ica and Junin, suggesting an epidemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 into Peru likely by people local mobility (10) . These results together with the nationwide widely distributed Peruvian isolates within clade supports the community spread likely originated from Lima.For the remaining clades (19A, 19B and 20C), we inferred SARS-CoV-2 virus putative introductions to Peru between mid-December 2019 and early March 2020 ( Figure 1A and Table 1 ).The clades 19A and 19B have mainly included Asian isolates (72% and 54%, respectively) suggesting that introductions from Asia account for the majority of cases found in Peru in the early pandemic period ( Figure 1A , B and Table 1 ).Our study also revealed some early introductions into Peru before the first case was reported (Table 1) . That is likely to happen due to during this period the air travels were permitted while pandemic was happening. However, there is not epidemiological data which supported it. 1.1, B.1.1, B.1 and B.5 ones were registered by WGS ( Figure 1A ). This spread of B sub lineages into Peru might be associated with the mutation D614G at spike protein, hypothesized that G614 providing the virus to be more infectious than D614 (11) . These results are supported by the global epidemiological information that showed the predominance of the G614 variant after SARS-CoV-2 spread into Europe in late February and March. In addition, most introductions into South America countries (e.g. Colombia or Brazil) included European B lineages isolates (6, 7, 12) . However, any other factors might be involved including uneven sampling, chance and epidemiology reasons (13) .Furthermore, we identified non-synonymous mutations in all Peruvian SARS-CoV-2 isolates from sampled regions ( Figure S2 ) of which the most frequent ones were in the D614G (S gene) and P314L (ORF1b). Interestingly, the D614G mutation has been related to increased infectivity (11) being also in linkage disequilibrium with the P314L mutation where both ones almost invariably cooccur (14) . Therefore, that likely is one of the reasons for the viral rapid spread into all the country including Lima and Iquitos City (Loreto's department) where the antibody prevalence has reached 25.3% and 67%, respectively, as of July 2020 (15) .One of the limitations of this study are the differences between the number of Peruvian isolates from cases identified within Peru regions. Specifically, there were more SARS-CoV-2 representatives' sequences in Lima than in any Peru departments. Thus, it means that our estimates might be biased due to them being based on available background sequences at that time. Moreover, in the absence of epidemiological information such as travel history and contacts tracking, it is hard to associate periods of untracked transmissions with any specific regions or countries.We provided a first snapshot of the sources of epidemic transmission and genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in Peru in a global pandemic background, revealing multiple and independent introductions of the virus mainly from Europe and Asia. In addition, we found evidence that early spread of the virus in Lima City was sustained by community transmission. The data also underscore the limited efficacy of travel restrictions in a place once multiple introductions of the virus and community-driven transmission have already occurred. Our results emphasize the importance of using phylogenomic analyses to provide insights on sanitary interventions to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 Finally, we highlight the need for early and continued nationwide testing as well as the implementation of a real-time surveillance national system based on Whole-Genome Sequencing to identify untracked transmission clusters and to unscramble the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into Peru, and assess its impact on disease clinical severity.We obtained RNA of nasal and pharyngeal swabs from patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnostic at the National Institute of Health -Peru (NIH-Peru), between 05 March 2020 and 04July 2020 from departments of Lima, Callao, Ancash, Lambayeque, Ica, Arequipa, Junin. Samples that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR and with Ct < 25 were eligible to be included. The Genome-Whole Sequencing (GWS) of SARS-CoV-2 isolates (n=96) were performed on Illumina MiSeq at NIH-Peru using the CleanPlex® SARS-CoV-2 Panel (Paragon Genomics).The sequencing mean depth was 2,767.68. We generated an average reads number of 887,561 reads by sample. To remove low-quality reads, trim off low-quality we use fqCleaner v.0.5.0. Filtered reads were mapped against SARS-CoV-2 reference (NC_045512) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner MEM algorithm BWA-MEM v0.7.7 (arXiv:1303.3997v2). SAMtools and Geneious Prime were used to sort BAM files, to generate alignment statistics and to obtain consensus sequence. Previous construction of the consensus genome sequence, we removed primer sequences with Software package fgbio using the primer genomic coordinates provided by Paragon Genomics.SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Peru (n=62) available in GISAID as of 26 August 2020 were selected until 07 April 2020 getting a dataset of 149 Peruvian genomes that cover a period from 05March (officially first reported case) to 04 July of 12 Peruvian regions. In addition to this dataset, others countries sequences (n=3323) were retrieved randomly one genome per country per day (collection date) from GISAID between 26 December 2019 (including Wuhan-01 genome) and 01July 2020 conforming a final genomic dataset of 3472 sequences to investigate the origins and genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in Peru by maximum likelihood phylodynamic approaches. The full genomic dataset was classified using the nomenclature of PANGOLIN (Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages) (16) .The full genomic dataset (n=3472) was aligned using MAFFT v 7.1 (10.1093/nar/gkf436) with default parameters. The alignment was manually curated, trimming the 5' and 3' ends and ambiguous regions. The final length of alignment was 29520 pb. We estimate a maximum likelihood tree of 3472 aligned sequences using IQ-tree v 1.6 (17) under a HKY nucleotide substitution model, with gamma distribution of among site rate variation (HKY+G+I) as selected by ModelFinder (18) and using the EPI_ISL_406801 sequence (GISAID) to root the tree. To measure branch support, we used Shimodaira-Hasegawa-approximate likelihood ratio test (SH-aLRT) with 1000 replicates.TempEst v1.5.1 (19) was used to assess the strength of temporal signal and inspect for outliers in the dataset by a root-to-tip regression of genetic distance against sampling date. We used TreeTime v0.7.6 (20) to estimate a time scaled phylogeny of ML tree. The analysis was performed using HKY substitution model and a coalescent Skyline prior to model population size changes under a strict clock (21) . We also used the flag -confidence to retrieve node dates with 90% confidence intervals.The clades were analyzed with NextStrain nomenclature for SARS-CoV-2 (https://nextstrain.org/ncov) Major clades that contained Peru sequences were defined by nucleotide substitutions and/or amino acid with ≥70% bootstrap support value in the ML tree and tMRCA with 90% of confidence intervals. To recognize local or introductions events were counted only for reproducible nodes with ≥70% bootstrap support value in the ML tree. Introduction events were defined as Peru sequences that clustered with non-Peru sequences across different clades. Local transmission events were defined as Peru-exclusive clusters with at least 5 or more sequences that were reproduced in the time-scaled inference (8) . Statistical analyses and tree visualization using ggtree package were carried out in R version 3.6.2.This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Health from Peru (OI-011-20).

2075bb6deacda5883d43043803583b16caca2483,"Genomic and phylogenetic characterisation of an imported case of SARS-CoV-2 in Amazonas State, Brazil","cal outcomes usually occur in patients with comorbidities, and the disease can progress, presenting arrhythmia and shock, that could evolve to death. (5, 6) The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to family Coronaviridae, genus Betacoronavirus. In 2002 and 2012, two outbreaks occurred caused by new coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with lethality ranging from nine to 33%, respectively. (7, 8, 9) The coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, with 80 to 120 nm in diameter. Three proteins compose the virion surface: spike (S), membrane (M), and small membrane protein (E), giving the virus a crownlike visual on electron micrograph. (10, 11) This viral family has one of the largest RNA genome of all other RNA viruses, with a single non-segmented positive-stranded RNA of approximately 30 kb. (12) In Brazil, the first recorded case of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in the end of February, in the city of São Paulo, followed by cases in the Northeast (Bahia), Central-West (Brasília) and South (Rio Grande do Sul) regions. (13) The northern of Brazil was the last region of the country to detected SARS-CoV-2 in its population. In March 13th, the first case in the State of Amazonas was detected in a woman that traveled to England and return to the Amazonas capital, Manaus. (14) After three days, the second case of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in Manaus and characterised in the present study.One 56-years-old man returning from Madrid, Spain, arrived asymptomatic in Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil on 15-Mar-2020. At that time, a massive outbreak of COVID-19 was already established in several European countries, suggesting that travelers should be kept in quarantine at arrival. Even without the symptoms of a respiratory infection, nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing as a routine established for respiratory virus surveillance at Instituto Leônidas e Maria Deane (ILMD) -Fiocruz, Amazonas State, Brazil, since 2019. The swabs were combined and submitted to total nucleic acid extraction with a commercial kit (Biogene, Recife, PE, Brazil) and immediately evaluated using the reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC/USA) (On 15-Mar-2020, CDC updated the RT-qPCR protocol removing the N3 target). This RT-qPCR assay employs different primers and probes sets aiming three regions of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) gene (https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download), and the human RNase P as an internal control.The analysed sample tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with Cts values of 14.43 (N1), 15.39 (N2) and15.33 (N3). Thus, we immediately generated cDNA with random primers and Superscript IV reverse transcriptase (Ther-moFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). We had previously designed a PCR scheme to amplify the entire genome of the SARS-CoV-2 based on an alignment of all complete genome sequences available on GenBank at 03/03/2020. Conserved regions were chosen for primer design with Primer3 v2.3.7. embedded in Geneious Software 10.2.6, (15) spanning around 2.2Kb and with an overlap region between 131 and 225 bp. This PCR scheme resulted in 15 amplicons with further details presented in the Supplementary data ( Table I) .The SARS-CoV-2 whole genome was amplified with Platinum SuperFi II Green PCR master mix (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) using the 15 primers sets in individual reactions. Each amplicon was then visualised as a unique and intense DNA fragment on agarose gel electrophoresis stained with GelRed (Biotium, Hayward, CA, United States). The PCR amplicons were precipitated with molecular biology grade Polietilenoglicol (PEG) 8,000 (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) and then resuspended in nuclease-free water. After one-hour incubation at 37ºC, all amplicons were quantified in ng/μL using Qubit 2.0 and the dsDNA HS assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Finally, the number of DNA copies in each purified amplicon was estimated with ENDMEMO (http://www.endmemo.com/bio/dnacopynum.php), normalised, and pooled. A single library was constructed using the Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep and clustered with MiSeq Reagent Micro Kit v2 (300-cycles), following the manufacturer's protocols. Nucleotide sequencing was performed in the MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States), installed at ILMD, in a pairedend run (2x150 cycles).A total of 10,946,898 reads were trimmed for quality and adapters using BBDUK v37.25, embedded in Geneious software. Thus, 8,362,418 reads were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 NCBI Reference Sequence NC_045512.2 using Geneious map-to-reference tool. The BR_AM_ILMD_20140001 final consensus genome sequence contains 29,789 nucleotides, with no gaps, a Q40 score of 100%, with no undetermined ""N"" bases and high average coverage (> 34,000X). To avoid any primers bias, we removed both primer binding sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends. Thus, our final sequence represents the positions between nucleotides 47 and 29,835 or 99.6% of the NCBI RefSeq previously mentioned.We aligned the BR_AM_ILMD_20140001 genomic sequence with the SARS-CoV-2 NCBI Reference Sequence NC_045512 using MAFFT v7.388 (16) to investigate any mutations throughout genome. A total of nine mutations were observed at nucleotide positions 8,782 (C to T); 9,477 (T to A); 12,781 (C to T); 14,805 (C to T); 25,979 (G to T); 26,642 (C to T); 28,144 (T to C); 28,657 (C to T) and 28,863 (C to T), with four of these leading to residues substitution in the deduced protein sequences (Table) .To put the BR_AM_ILMD_20140001 genome in a global context, we aligned the new genome to a pool of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes with at least 25,000 nucleotides available at GISAID database (17) on March 31st, 2020 using MAFFT. We adopted a subsampling strategy to reduce T  A  T  T  T  T  C  T  T   Codon position  AGC  TTT  TAC  TAC  GGA  GCC  TTA  GAC  TCA   AGT  TAT  TAT  TAT  GTA  GCT  TCA  GAT computation time, selecting subsets of 15-20 sequences retaining the most viral diversity from each country using the CD-HIT program. (18) This subsampling approach resulted in a final sequence dataset with 490 sequences from 53 countries [Supplementary data (Table II) ].Complete coding sequences (CDS) were subjected to maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic reconstruction with PhyML v3.0, (19) under the HKY+Γ4 nucleotide substitution model. According to the ML phylogenetic tree, the BR_AM_ILMD_20140001 sequence belonged to the lineage A (20) (Fig. 1A) clustering within a monophyletic cluster (aLRT = 1.00) comprising sequences from Spain, Chile, France, Greece, Georgia, Netherlands, Senegal (Fig. 1B) . The pangolin web application (pangolin.coguk.io) further assigned the sequences from this cluster to the A.2 lineage (Fig. 1B) .After temporal validation with Tempest (21) (Fig.  2A) , we conducted a Bayesian discrete spatiotemporal analysis with all lineage A sequences (Fig. 2) using the BEAST v1.10 package, (22) applying the strict molecular clock and the parametric exponential coalescent models. The strict molecular clock model was selected over the relaxed uncorrelated one, (23) after marginal likelihood estimation using path sampling and stepping-stone sampling methods (24) [Supplementary data (Table III) ].The analysis under the uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock model, however, resulted in estimates similar to those of the strict clock model (data not shown). We estimated that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of lineage A.2 originated in Spain (posterior state probability, PSP = 0.99) in the beginning of February 2020 (95% highest posterior density, HPD = 2nd -22nd Feb 2020). The phylogeographic analysis also pointed out that the BR_AM_ILMD_20140001 was most probably introduced from Spain (PSP = 0.43) (Fig. 2B) .Like other viral infections, the infection by SARS-CoV-2 can be asymptomatic and this fact has been reported in different studies. (25, 26, 27) It is noteworthy that according to the definition of suspected case adopted in Brazil at the time that we investigated this asymptomatic carrier, he would not be included in SARS-CoV-2 testing, despite returning from an area with active transmission like Madrid, Spain. (28) Until 24-Mar-2020, when we deposited the BR_AM_ILMD_20140001 genome information at https://www.gisaid.org, there were only 17 Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences, and the sequence reported in the present work is the first complete genome from the northern Brazilian region.Several laboratories over the world are now sequencing thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, which is undoubtedly the most notable effort of viral sequencing in human history. Like any other virus, the new coronavi- rus is continuously evolving as more hosts, humans or animals, are getting infected. Thus, it is of paramount importance to generate and share high-quality full viral genomes from different regions over the world to better understand the SARS-CoV-2 evolution. The information related to the viral evolution is not only necessary for molecular epidemiology studies, but also to monitor if the newly identified mutations are linked to different clinical presentations or may drive into false-negative results when performing nucleic acid amplification assays, like real-time PCR.Therefore, in this work, we aimed to describe and characterise the complete genome of the SARS-CoV-2 obtained from an asymptomatic carrier returning from Madrid, Spain. To achieve this goal, we decided to use a nucleotide sequencing strategy where firstly all the 15 amplicons, encompassing the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome, were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, each amplicon was quantified and normalised in order to prevent that one region could be overrepresented during sequencing. In order to make our approach more straightforward, we decided to evaluate if longer amplicons could be generated in a very similar way. We were successful in generating amplicons around 6 Kb, with a minimum overlap of 131 bp, reducing the number of PCR reactions to 5 instead of 15 (data not showed). The conditions to amplify the 6 Kb amplicons followed the manufacturer's recommendations, with the primers pairs details presented in the Supplementary data (Table I) note, we observed that only samples with high viral load (e.g. Ct lower than 21) were fully amplified using the 6Kb protocol. We believe that this approach may be exciting not only to reduce the current protocol costs, but also for those interested in using long reads sequencing technologies like PacBio SMS and nanopore.Recently, Rambaut and colleagues proposed a rational and dynamic virus classification for SARS-CoV-2 genomes based on a phylogenetic framework. (20) Using this approach authors identified at the root of the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 two lineages that were simply denoted as lineages A and B. In our analysis, while all Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 sequences belonged to the lineage B, mostly from the B.1 lineage, the BR_AM_ ILMD_20140001 genome clustered within the lineage A.2, indicating that BR_AM_ILMD_20140001 strain belongs to a distinct transmission cluster than the other full Brazilian genomes reported until March 31st, 2020. Originally, the lineage B.1 predominated in Europe and North America, (17, 20) and currently, constitutes the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variant circulating in Brazil. (29) The lineage A.2 constitutes a predominantly Spanish lineage, found in at least 25 countries (20) and our phylogeographic analysis corroborates its origins and reinforces the importation scenario from Spain to Brazil.In this study, we report and characterise the first SARS-CoV-2 genome obtained from an infected subject in the Brazilian North Region. Since this case was an asymptomatic carrier, it is not easy to suggest when infection has occurred. However, our phylogeographic analysis strongly indicates this individual was infected in Spain. Finally, we would like to emphasise that more fully genomes studies of the SARS-CoV-2 are necessary to better understand the evolution of this emerging lifethreatening virus and the information of the nucleotide sequence described here may contribute to future molecular epidemiological studies in Brazil. In this sense, the protocol that we described in the present study may be useful to aid other researchers to generate other highquality SARS-CoV-2 genomes.Nucleotide sequence accession number -The complete genome sequence of the BR_AM_ILMD_20140001 isolate is available in GISAID since March 24, 2020, under the ID number EPI_ISL_417034.",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-25,9
b8dce43c21122bb7a79f9379c5383069df76bea8,Journal Pre-proofs Research Notes COVID-19 and The Rise of Intimate Partner Violence COVID-19 and The Rise of Intimate Partner Violence COVID-19 and The Rise of Intimate Partner Violence,"Eliminating violence against women is not only a major public health issue (Krug et al., 2002; Bott et al., 2012) but also a key objective of the Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, 2015) .However, progress in this area could be stopped and even reversed by the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This research note provides one of the first systematic and nationwide analysis documenting the unintended consequences of nonpharmaceutical policies to decrease the spread of the virus on intimate partner violence.Stay-at-home policies have been widely used to reduce the impact of the virus. It is estimated that at least three billion people around the world sheltered in place (Hall and Tucker, 2020) and 142 countries imposed some form of stay-at-home requirements (Hale et al, 2020) .These policies have raised multiple concerns, especially for their impacts on developing countries and on gender equality. i Scholars and International Organizations have argued that stay-at-home policies would increase violence against women (e.g., van Gelder et al, 2020; Peterman et al, 2020; Bradbury-Jones and Isham, 2020; UNFPA, 2020) . This argument is often based on recent scholarship suggesting that intimate partner violence increased during past epidemics (Roesch et al, 2020; Durevall, and Lindskog, 2015) but also with economic downturns (e.g., see Buller et al, 2018; Cools and Kotsadam, 2017 for low-and middle-income countries and Van der Berg and Tertilt, 2012 for advanced economies). This could be further exacerbated in developing countries where most homes lack sufficient space, which forces people to be in much closer proximity (Brown, Ravallion, and Van De Walle, 2020) .However, most of the current reporting about the increase on intimate partner violence (IPV) during the ongoing pandemic is anecdotal. In most cases, it relies on increases in reporting compared to same month the year before. ii Such analysis could be misleading. For instance, in Peru, the country where we focus on this research note, calls to the national helpline for violence against women (Línea 100) increased by 33 percent in April 2020 with respect to April 2019. But so, did the volume of calls in January (26 percent), a time before Peru implemented its lockdown policies to combat COVID-19. Others have compared calls before and after March within 2020 alone. Yet, previous work in Peru has documented seasonal increases in IPV in years before the onset of the virus (Agüero, 2019). Thus, each of these approaches alone fails to provide unbiased estimates of the possible rise in intimate partner violence as an unintended consequence of the nonpharmaceutical policies to combat COVID-19We use monthly data on the number of calls to the Linea 100 by state from January 2007 to July 2020. iii To overcome prior limitations, I use two methodologies. First, I compare calls to the help line made before and after March but also across multiple years. This double comparison allows us to eliminate seasonal patterns as well as secular trends in calls to the helpline that could biased the estimates. This is done by including month, year and state fixed effects. The use of multiple years (2007-2020) also allows for state-and month-specific trends. Using this methodology, we find that calls to Línea 100 increased its incidence rate by 1.48 times since Peru started its lockdown in Mid-March. The effects increase over time, with higher calls in July (2.12 times), June (1.72), May (1.58) than in April (1.02).The assumption needed for this methodology is validated by our second approach: an event study restricting the sample to 2019 and 2020. This analysis confirms our main findings and show that they are not driven by distant years. Most importantly, it validates the main approach by showing a lack of a pre-trend between January 2019 and February 2020 and supports the parallel trend assumption.An important finding comes from the robustness checks and heterogenous analysis. The rise in calls to the helpline is observed across the board. It is not driven by any specific state, including Lima, who has the largest call volume in any given year. Removing one state at a time from the analysis does not change the conclusions. Furthermore, we explore whether the increase varies by background characteristics at the state level measured in 2007, the first full year of operation of the Línea 100. It does not. We consider education levels, access to health insurance, urban population, number of rooms in dwellings, access to public services and durable goods. The rise in calls is the same in states with high and low values (relative to the median) of these background characteristics. We also consider prior prevalence of physical and sexual intimate partner violence and continue to find the same effect in states with low and higher prevalence.Focusing on calls to a helpline has many advantages with respect to other data sources during the ongoing pandemic. First, it is very well documented that police records are not reliable measures of violence against women (e.g., Palermo et al, 2014 and United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2017) . Second, lockdown measures have severely limited the use of face-to-face interviews such as the widely use Demographic and Health Surveys. These surveys represent the main data source for intimate partner violence in many developing countries. However, in many countries, these surveys are currently not been implemented. In countries where they are conducted, the data will not be available until next year. Third, for the handful of countries with a well-established network of shelters for women, including Peru (e.g., Kavanaugh et. al., 2018) , workers in these centers have not been declared as essential, so these centers were not operating during the first months after the lockdown. Thus, calls to Línea 100 helpline provide the best available data to measure violence against women during the pandemic. Finally, the national coverage from the Línea 100 offers an important advantaged relative to recent papers, increasing the external validity of our study. ivOn March 15, 2020, Peru's government announced that a severe nationwide lockdown would be implemented, effectively, the next day. v The first positive test of COVID-19 was detected on March 6 and the first death was confirmed on March 19 after the lockdown had started. Peru's was one of the earliest coronavirus lockdowns in the region. The lockdown suppressed constitutional rights on free mobility around the country. Individuals must stay at home and a curfew was implemented. The lockdown was originally scheduled for two weeks, but it has been renewed many times. In May, the government started first of four re-opening phases. For example, for the first time, it allowed only certain restaurants to offer on-site pick-up and home delivery services. But stay-at-home orders continued nationwide.In June and July, the government started phases two and three of the re-opening, allowing every time more sectors of the economy to open. It also started focalized lockdowns, mandating sheltering-in-place in some states but not others based on the prevalence of COVID-19 cases (DS 116-2020-PCM). However, the curfew continued nationwide (from 10PM to 4AM). At the end of July, the government renewed the focalized lockdown orders until August 31 st (DS-135-2020-PCM). Throughout this time schools never opened. The school calendar runs from March to December and the timing of the pandemic prevented the start of the school year, forcing millions of students to remain at home.Peru is also a country with high levels of intimate partner violence. The 2019 Peruvian DHS, the latest available, shows that 58 percent of women aged 15 to 49 had experienced violence by their current or last partner. This figure has shown an important decline over the past ten years. In 2009, the rate was 77 percent. Understanding whether policies that seek to control a major pandemic lead to unintended negative consequences for women's safety is an important policy question. This is even more salient for developing countries, such as Peru, where the slow but consistent reductions in violence over the past ten years could be quickly reversed by the responses to COVID-19. The data and models to estimate the change in violence against women during the pandemic is described in next section.The main variable for our analysis is the number of calls to the helpline Línea 100 adjusted by population size. This helpline was created in late 2006. Dialing 100 from any phone (landline or mobile) is free and connects the caller to a trained operator who records the call and if needed, refers the caller to the women shelters (Centros de Emergencia Mujer) located near the caller's location. However, from mid-March to the end of June, these centers were closed severely limiting the services provided to callers. For our analysis we use data at the month and state level on the volumes of calls per 100,000 people. Information on calls is publicly available on the website of thethe government entity in charge of delineating the policy to reduce violence against women. This dataset is updated monthly and the most recent release, including calls during the month of July 2020, was made available at the end of August. At this frequency and aggregation level (by state), the data are available since January of 2007. vi This leads to 4,075 state-month-year observations (25 states, 13 full years plus 7 months in 2020). Microlevel data for the calls during 2020 will not be available until the second quarter of 2021 at best. Thus, given the urgency of identifying a rise in calls during the pandemic, we opted to use the aggregated data. A possible drawback is that the aggregation would reduce the variance in the sample and would prevent us from finding statistically significant effects. As shown in the next section, this is not the case suggesting that delaying the analysis until the publication of the microdata would have prevented us from documenting the increase while it was happening. vii To test for the increase in calls to the helpline during the pandemic, we use a Poisson count model as follow:where the variable Calls imt represents the expected number of calls to the Línea 100 in state i, in month m and year t. The variable Post m is binary and takes the value of one for months from March onwards and zero for January and February in any given year. Y2020 t is a binary indicator for the year 2020. Thus, Post m *Y2020 t is the interaction of interest. Our identification strategy compares calls to Línea 100 before and after March across multiple years. Therefore, Equation (1) indicate an increase in the rate of incidence of the calls during the nonpharmaceutical policies to combat COVID-19. As explained by Cameron and Trivedi (2013), an advantage of a Poisson specification is that fixed effects can be included without creating an incidental parameters problem. This is particularly important as some states, earlier in the sample, have relatively low counts by month. A second advantage is the consistency of the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters, which does not require that the arrival process for calls to the Línea 100 is actually Poisson (Cameron and Trivedi, 1986) .This specification helps us avoid the bias due to seasonal effects in calls to the helpline documented by Agüero (2019) by including month fixed effects ( m ). Also, as shown in Appendix Figure A2 and Furthermore, we include month-specific trends to account for secular trends at the month level.We compute robust standard errors clustered at the state-year level (350 clusters) and our findings are robust if using alternative clusters and constructions of the standard errors. For instance, we consider clustering by state-month without altering our findings. Using the Newey-West HAC correction yields smaller standard errors, which would imply larger t-statistics, hence,we opted for a more conservative approach. All these additional results are available upon request. ( 1( ℎ = ) * 2020 ) + + + + + ) (2)In particular, we replace the variable Post m with month-specific binary variables from March to July who now interact with the Y2020 t indicator. In this specification we allow the effect to vary by month relaxing the assumption of equality across all post-March 2020 parameters as inEquation (1). In the new equation, we continue to control for all the previous fixed effects and trends.To further strengthen the validity of our identification strategy we conduct an event study.We focus on 2019 and 2020 and estimate one parameter for each month from January 2019 to July 2020, leaving February 2020 as the omitted category. This model continues to include fixed effects by state as well as state-specific trends. Month and year fixed effects are not included due to redundancy. Equation (3) presents this model formally:The event time coefficients for   with ={Mar20,…,July20} capture the dynamic effects starting in March 2020. All previous parameters,   for ={Jan19,…,Dec19,Jan20}, capture pretrends, i.e., trends on calls to Línea 100 before the pandemic. As such, the pre-trends will allow us to test for the parallel trend assumption. In all cases, the parameters measure differences with respect to February 2020, the omitted category. The results of applying these methods are discussed in the next section. assuming that the effect is the same for all months since March 2020. We start with a simpler model ignoring state-and month-specific trends (column 1). In this case, the incident rate increases by 1.61 times since March 2020. This is statistically significant at the 1% level.Expanding the model by including state-specific trends (column 2) and all trends (column 3), continues to show an excess of calls since March 2020 of around 1.48 times.[ Table 1 around here]We expand this model to be consistent with the observed pattern in Figure 1 . Panel B of Table 1 reports estimates of Equation (2) where we allow for month-specific effects. In all specifications, we find an acceleration in the rise of calls to Línea 100, with larger effects for each new month.To validate our main specification, we test for parallel trends before March in 2020 and 2019. Figure 2 plots the (exponentiated) parameters from the even study described in Equation(3). Relative the February 2020, the omitted category, the pre-trend coefficients help validate our identification assumption. There is no clear trend in volume of calls between January 2019 and January 2020. Indeed, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the calls in January 2020 are the same as those a year before (p-value=0.734). Similarly, February 2019 does not differ in the number of calls compared to February 2020. Furthermore, this analysis also documents that the rise in calls to Línea 100 starts in April and accelerates in the following months. This further confirms our previous conclusion and validates our main methodology.[ Figure 2 around here]We conducted several robustness checks. First, our findings are robust to measuring calls to the helpline without adjusting for population (Appendix Table A2 ). Second, they are also robust to the use a linear regression (adjusted for population) instead of a Poisson model (Appendix Table A3 ). Third, we test whether the findings are sensitive to the years selected to construct the counterfactual. In Appendix Figure 3 , we show that reducing the sample period oneyear at a time does not alter our conclusion. In particular, we removed a year from the beginning until we are left with the minimum number of years to estimate state-and month-specific trends.In these tests we maintained our preferred specification, which includes state, month and year fixed effects in addition to the aforementioned specific trends. The robustness of the estimates is found when considering the restricted model (Equation 1) or the more flexible specification (Equation 2), shown in Panels A and B of Appendix Figure 3 , respectively.We also explore whether the results are driven by a specific state. In Appendix Figure 4 we remove one state at a time from the analysis. Again, whether we considered the flexible model or the more restricted one, our results are not driven by any specific state. This is an important result. As described in section 2, Peru moved from an initial national lockdown to a focalized one by June. Yet, the pattern of an ever-increasing volume of calls over time does not depend on the states included in the sample.To investigate this issue further we conduct an heterogenous analysis applied to Equation(2). Following Palermo et al (2004) Figure 3 .[ Figure 3 around here]We find that the pattern of increase calls to Línea 100 since March 2020 is observed across all background characteristics. The surge is observed in states with high and low levels of education, density, health insurance coverage, access to public services and ownership of durable goods. It is also present in areas with high and low pre-determined prevalence of intimate partner violence.Finally, we compile an additional dataset on calls to Linea 100 by age of the victim using public data from Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Populations. Unfortunately, these data are available only at national level and not by state (but by month and year) so we cannot conduct the exact same analysis as before. In particular, we cannot longer account for all the controls of Equation (2). For instance, we cannot add state fixed effects or state-specific trends. We also are not able to include month-specific trends. With those caveats, we use this restricted dataset andshow that for all age groups, calls to the helpline rise since March with larger effects in July relative to prior months (see Appendix Table A4 ).All this evidence suggests that the rise in calls to the domestic violence helpline are broad and not limited to any of the large set of features considered in this study.We provide the one of the first systematic analysis of the unintended effects of the efforts to control the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in developing countries. We document an increase in calls to the helpline for violence against women in Peru after stay-at-home policies started in mid-March. Our estimates show a 48 percent increase since the pandemic, with effects increasing over time. This rise takes place in a country where already almost 60 percent of women experienced violence before the virus arrived. The results are not driven by any particular demographic group or background characteristics, even when considering pre-determined prevalence of domestic violence.Given our findings, there is an urgent need to identify policies that could help mitigate the unintended effects of stay at home orders to combat COVID-19. viii For example, the work by Buller et al (2018) suggests that cash transfers could reduce intimate partner violence. This resonates with the findings by Leslie and Wilson (2020) . They observed that the initial increase in calls to 911 about domestic violence in the United States was followed by a decline that coincides with checks sent out as part of the CARES Act in the middle of April. Some developing countries, including Peru, had provided cash transfers during the pandemic too. Understanding whether those transfers brought some relief from financial strain and reduced intimate partner violence is a pending research question.

The effect of vertical confinement and release in Brazil","a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak has been ongoing for 5 months now [1] . Since it was first reported in Dec 2019 in China [2] , the virus rapidly made its way to other parts of the world taking pandemic proportions [3] . The number of cases and deaths exponentially increased reaching a total of 1.5 million confirmed cases and 88 thousand deaths in early April 2020. Recent disease outbreaks that spilled over from animals such as Ebola [4, 5] or avian influenza [6] have been described as specific to developing countries. COVID-19 has been breaking this myth as the virus has been particularly exceptional at breaching in inside developed countries and challenging their health system. In Europe, Italy has been particularly affected. With 140 thousand cases, the Italian national health system has been struggling to effectively respond to the exponentially increasing flow of patients in need of intensive care [7] . The United States recently surpassed China in total number of cases (420 thousand), becoming a particular hot bed in this phase of the pandemics [8] . By the time this article is published, there will likely not be a place on Earth where the virus did not cause any damage. West African countries such as Sierra Leone just reported their first cases [9] and catastrophic scenario similar to the 2016 Ebola outbreak is possible.The threat of COVID-19 on countries that started to count cases prompted us to develop a model to describe the evolution of the epidemic and its effects on the health care system. Mathematical models are a powerful tool that proved important in previous epidemiological disasters such as the Ebola virus [10, 11] , smallpox [12] , or influenza [13] , contributing to the understanding of the dynamics of disease and providing useful predictions about the potential transmission of a disease and the effectiveness of possible control measures, which can provide valuable information for public health policy makers [14] . SIR-type models, also known as Kermack-McKendrick model [15] , consists of a set of differential equations and has been applied to a variety of infectious diseases. Although containing simplifying assumptions, SIR models have been of great help on stopping epidemics in the past by e.g. informing effective vaccination protocols [16] .Here we develop a SEIR type compartmental model for COVID-19 including both symptomatic and asymptomatic, quarantined, and hospitalized while taking into consideration differences by age groups. We also analysed the effect of confinement during a specific period of time. Contrary to similar epidemiological models, the proposed SEIR model is initiated by the first confirmed COVID-19 death. Numerical simulations of the deterministic models are compared with real numbers of the ongoing outbreak in different countries. Moreover, the deterministic framework in which we operate greatly simplifies model analysis and allows a more thorough comparison of the various intervention strategies.In this work we focus on the case of Brazil, where the pandemics counts 16 000 confirmed cases and 800 fatalities (April 9th, 2020). The country has 35 682 ICU beds according to government data of Feb 2020 [17] . The first official SARS-CoV-2 case in Brazil was confirmed in São Paulo on February 26th and the first official COVID-19 death was reported on March 19th. Shortly after, a lockdown was enacted first in Rio de Janeiro on March 22nd, then on other regional urban centers. There is no reliable measurement of the percentage of the population that is currently in confinement; however, the number is estimated to be around 56% according to satellite data.Given the socio-economic consequences of a lockdown, particularly on a middle income country, decision-makers are considering a vertical confinement as an exit strategy to the regular lockdown. Vertical confinement is understood as reducing contact to a specific age group that is more at risk of contracting and developing SARS-CoV-2 [18] , as opposed to horizontal (or general) confinement that does not discriminate between age groups. In the next section we will present the model, followed by validation. We then apply the model to the specific SARS-CoV-2 scenario in Brazil, and run a sensitivity analysis. Finally, we test the effect of both general and vertical confinement on the epidemic curve.We used a modified version of a SEIR-type deterministic compartmental model to trace COVID-19 epidemic evolution in an isolated population of N individuals. We assumed that a population could be subdivided into the following compartments:• Susceptible (S): COVID-19 naive individuals,• Confined (C): subset of susceptibles removed from the epidemics (by e.g. social distancing).• Exposed (E): Susceptible that have been exposed to infective individuals, We split the population in subcategories by age (range, 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, and 80+ years old) and we consider that some flow rates between compartments should vary with age [18] .Taking into consideration the 8 compartments and the 9 age groups, the model is described by a set of 72 coupled non-linear equations:For each compartment X the age sub-bins add up to X � ∑ i X i and compartments are such that S + C + E + A + I + Q + H + R = N, with N � ∑ i N i being the total population; N i is the population in each age bin. The software is written in python 3.7, and is made public at https:// github.com/wlyra/covid19. Eqs (1)-(8) describe a compartmentalization of the population and the flow between the compartments. Contact with infected individuals removes a fraction of the susceptible (S) population at a rate given by λ, referred to as infection force, making them exposed (E) to SARS-CoV-2. The exposed (E) become infectious at the rate σ; a fraction p of them becoming symptomatic (I) and a fraction (1 − p) becoming asymptomatic (A). The symptomatic (I) are removed from the infective force and become quarantined (Q) at a rate γ. The asymptomatic (A) are removed at a rate θ, a fraction w of them going in remission and a fraction (1 − w) becoming symptomatic. A fraction q i of the quarantined (Q) are hospitalized at a rate ξ. The hospitalized (H) are removed at a rate η. The average fatality rate is μ i .The timescales corresponding to σ, γ, θ, ξ, and η are the latent period t σ � σ −1 the infectious interval t γ � γ −1 , the remission time t θ � θ −1 , the time to hospitalization t ξ � ξ −1 , and the average length of hospital stay t η � η −1 .The infection force is driven by the infected, both symptomatic (I) and asymptomatic (A)where we use the shorthand notationand β is the infection rate, related to the reproduction number RðtÞ viaLock-down consists of having a fraction of the susceptible population removed from the epidemic dynamic by moving them from S i to C i at a rate ψ i . Similarly, lifting the lock-down is done by placing C i into S i at the rate ϕ i . We consider these functions to be Dirac deltaswhere t lock and t lift are the time (in days) of lock-down and of lifting of the lock-down, respectively. To allow for partial demographic lock-downs, a i and b i are allowed to vary by age (e.g., 80% of the 40's age group population are confined). The flow chart between compartments is shown in Fig 1. Other diagnostic quantities are the numbers U i of people in need of an intensive care unit (ICU) bedwhere z i is the fraction of hospitalized patients that need critical care. Both z i and the hospitalization fraction q i are age-stratified.For integration, we use a standard Runge-Kutta algorithm, with timestepsIn this section we present details on how we validated the model and how to determine the characteristic timescales and other parameters.We consider the susceptible population (S) as the total population of a country since at the onset of outbreak no one is immune to the virus yet. Model parameters, shown in Table 1 , were based on previous knowledge of Coronaviruses, as well as early reports and research on COVID-19 [19] . The age-dependent parameters (fatality rate μ i , fraction of infectious that are hospitalized q i , and fraction of hospitalized that need critical care z i ) are shown in Table 2 . Because all these timescales are much smaller than a human lifetime, aging of the population is ignored and no upward flow between the age sub-compartments (i ! i + 1) is considered. Population pyramids are taken from UN data (https://www.populationpyramid.net), and split into the pre-defined age bins.We derive RðtÞ from the available statistics since knowledge of the real number of infected is not clear. The most reliable indicator in this situation is the number of deaths. Given a fatality rate μ and an average time τ between exposure and death, the number of dead at a time t + τ will equal the fatality rate times the number of people that got exposed at time t. Assuming that confinement dynamics do not play a role (although it is trivial to include it), the equation is the following:Taking the continuous limit and substituting Eq (1)where we also write t r � t + τ for the retarded time. Summing over all age bins D � ∑ i D i we have the cumulative death rate on the LHS, which is an observableand hμSi�∑ i μ i S i . We can then substitute Eq (9) and solve for RðtÞ as a function of timeSince death occurs an average of τ days after infection, we start the integration τ days before the first reported COVID-19 death, i.e., t = 0 means t r = τ. The initial conditions are fully specified when the initial number of exposed individuals is defined. This should bewhere t 0 is the time of the first death and � m � N À 1 P i m i n i is the age-weighted fatality rate. According to current knowledge of the epidemics, τ � 14 days [18] . We compared our model predictions with official data on cases and deaths for multiple countries, as tracked by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov). We plot in the left panel of Fig 2 the fatality rate for a number of countries, which corresponds to the left hand side of Eq (18) . We apply Eq (19) to convert this data into RðtÞ, feeding this value into Eqs (1)-(8) to start the SEIR evolution. The populations I(t) and S(t) that enter in Eq (19) are then calculated to update RðtÞ. The resulting values are plotted in the right-hand-side of Fig 2. The timescales σ, γ, θ, and ξ, as well as the fractions p and w, are found by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting, with the priors given in Table 1 and explained in the Supporting Information (Markov Chain Monte Carlo).Finally, we compare the cumulative number of hospitalizations calculated from our model with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. For a country that is not doing massive testing and only reporting COVID-19 as acute cases reach the hospital, these curves should match reasonably well. , in log scale. The epidemic is starting at March 1st and the number of symptomatic is predicted to end at July 1st. The peak of symptomatics is predicted for May 17th with 20 million symptomatics. Consequently, there is a predicted rise in the number of hospitalized, reaching saturation on May 3rd and peaking on May 22nd with 10 6 hospitalized. ICU beds will reach saturation on May 3rd, when the � 35 thousand ICU beds in Brazil are occupied (since the estimate assumes that all ICU beds should be occupied with coronavirus patients, which is not realistic, the collapse should in fact happen PLOS ONE sooner). Demand for ICU will get higher until reaching a peak on May 22nd with 300 000 patients. The cumulative number of deaths on June 1st is 10 6 . Fig 3c contrasts the predicted cumulative numbers of infected persons (orange line), hospitalized persons (blue line), and deaths (black line). The figure also shows the cumulative number of confirmed cases (yellow dots) and actual deaths (black dots). The cumulative number of hospitalized is very close to the actual confirmed cases. This is expected as Brazil is not doing testing on a massive scale.We perform a sensitivity analysis, shown in Fig 5, by varying the parameters of the models by -2, 0, and 2 standard deviations as given by the results of the MCMC analysis (Fig 4) . Given 7 parameters, we run 3 7 = 2187 simulations. The fiducial model, with zero standard in all parameters, is shown as the thick line; all other models are shown as thin lines. The 95% confidence interval brackets about an order of magnitude above or below the fiducial model, or about three weeks left or right of it.Horizontal lockdown. In Fig 6 we check the effect of horizontal confinement, defined as equal percentage of the population confined at any age bin. There is a change in the epidemic dynamic when horizontal confinement is applied in different rates. The plots show (a) the number of hospitalizations, (b) the number of ICU cases, and (c) the number of fatalities, as a function of the degree of social distancing. Confinement was implemented at time t = 0 corresponding to March 22 when the first measurement of social distancing was implemented. To not overwhelm the health care system capacity (� 4 × 10 4 ) ICU beds, the level of social distancing should be over 70%. As mentioned in the introduction, estimates are that Brazil is maintaining 56% (with state-by-state variation from a maximum of 64.7% to a minimum of 53.7%). At this low level of distancing, capacity should be reached in less than 50 days, which is in agreement with the dynamical RðtÞ model in Fig 3. Vertical lockdown. We vary now the degree of confinement by age bin, characterizing the vertical confinement. Fig 7 shows the number of hospitalizations in a model where confinement was implemented, broken down by age bins. The upper plots show horizontal confinement with different proportions of the population (same as Fig 6 but broken down by age and in logarithmic scale). Confinement was implemented at the same time as in Fig 6. The other rows explore vertical confinement. In the second column 60% of the population under 40 is confined, but the population older than 40 is confined to a higher degree, at 90% (solid blue line) and 99% (dashed blue line). The cyan line marks the same model as the upper plots, where 60% of the population is confined, irrespective of age. The 3rd, 4th, and 5th rows of plots show the same analysis but confining 60% of the population up 50, 60, and 70 years old, respectively. As seen in the cyan line, the number of hospitalized rises from 30 to 60 years old and falls for 70 years old onwards. That is because even though 70+ are more likely to be hospitalized, the number of 30-60 is much higher in the population. Fig 8 shows the same results for the fraction of hospitalized that needs ICU. Fig 9 shows results from the same suite of models but for the number of fatalities. For the number of ICU cases, there is no significant difference past age 60, with only a minor uptick at the 70-80 age range. Collapse of the health care system can be avoided if vertical confinement is instored on people who are 60 or older, but at the expense of a significant number of extra ICU cases for the 50-60 age bin. At 60% confinement, hundreds of thousands of deaths are seen in the 60-70, 70-80, and 80+ age bins. The number drops to 50 000 in the 90% confinement. As noted before, vertical confinement for 60 years old and older leads to a significant number of deaths for the 50-60 age bin (over 50 000). Vertical confinement at 50 years old leads to a much lower death rate for this age segment.Finally, we look at vertical confinement as an exit strategy. In Fig 10 we model a release from lockdown on May 1st, according to two scenarios: full release for the population under 50 (dashed line) and full release for the population under 60 (solid line). The population past this age is kept at 90% confinement. The upper plots show the susceptible (S) and confined compartments (C), normalized by the number of individuals in the respective age bin. The second row from top to bottom shows the number of hospitalizations, the third row the number of ICU cases, and the last row the cumulative number of fatalities. As the population is released from the general confinement, the number of H/U/D peaks at 400 000/50 000/120 000 in the 50-60 age bin alone, that bears the lion's share of morbidity. Keeping the 50-60 age population in 90% confinement lowers the statistics significantly, with the health care system at capacity, and the number of deaths per age bin about 25 000, with 60+ years olds having the same fatalities as the 40-50 age group.As in any setting, the outbreak response strategy plays a crucial role on the quality of the outputs the models can give. Since the identification of the first case, the response strategy in Brazil has been changing over time. At first, only international travelers admitted to hospitals had access to SARS-CoV-2 testing. Now there are diagnostic clinics and universities involved in COVID-19 testing, but there is no national massive testing strategy in place. Besides, each Brazilian state has the authority to put in place their own strategy to address the epidemic. The states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, containing the largest metropoles in the country, adopted larger strategies of isolation with schools and stores closed early on while similar strategies had not yet been adopted in other states. Bottom line, the resulting morbidity and mortality rates can change significantly, resulting in dramatically different output numbers as the number of infected people or the number of hospital beds needed. It is necessary to have massive testing strategy in place to have better prediction accuracy of the models.Our model estimate hundreds of thousands of infected people in Brazil on April 1st. This is more than the number of expected cases in the country while we write this article, considering the estimated sub-notification of cases [20] and inaction on controlling the infection. It is possible that the actual number is lower, although it is also important to notice that Brazil has not done a real lockdown so far.The model assumes, in Eq (10) that there is no difference in infectiveness between symptomatic and asymptomatic population. This is an assumption that should be updated as further knowledge of COVID-19 is unveiled. We stress also that by using the cummulative hospitalization data as a guide in the MCMC, we are incurring into the problem raised by [21] , of overestimating the confidence interval precision; fitting raw incidence data instead would enhance the statistical accuracy.The model also ignores mobility, in the sense that it does not consider travel to and from the country. Given that Brazil is at the stage of community transmission (as of April 9th, 2020), this limitation should not be of significance to the results.Conversely, and more importantly, the model assumes that the confined population is completely safe from infection, whereas in reality a vertical lockdown may not be feasible to implement as the elderly are not adequately distanced from the younger in their family and/or social circle, and infection cannot be avoided if the younger are exposed to COVID-19.Finally, the analysis assumes that the data on fatalities is accurate. Underreported deaths should lead to an unknown source of error in the present study. Also, the MCMC produces error bars in the parameters that we did not take into account in the forward modeling.In this study we examine the strategy of vertical confinement as currently debated in Brazil. Since the fatality rate of COVID-19 appears to be higher among the elderly population, we https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237627.g010 studied how confinement by age groups (particularly 60 years old and beyond) affects the demand for hospital beds and intensive care beds.Our model suggests that at the current rate of advance of the pandemics, Brazil should face collapse of the health care system by May 15th, with 300 000 ICU beds needed (10 times more than the current capacity), and 10 6 fatalities. A decrease in the rate of confirmed cases is seen with respect to the rate of fatalities, which is indicative of the effect of the lockdown. A 60% lockdown reduces the number of deaths to 400 000 due to COVID-19, still not avoiding overload of the health care system. An increase in lockdown to 70% is needed to avoid the number of cases from overcoming the number of available critical care beds. The 95% confidence interval spans two orders of magnitude in cases or a month and a half in time.An exit strategy of confinement of individuals older than 60 years old by May 1st would see a second wave disproportionally affect the 50-60 age bin. The ICU cases in this age range alone would bring the health care system to collapse and result in over 100 000 deaths. Confinement by age group should consider the population over 50 years old as well. However, the age range 50-60 is also a part of the workforce, and thus defeats the purpose of a confinement by age. Moreover, we emphasize that our model assumes an idealized lockdown where the confined are perfectly insulated from contamination, while in reality there would be several practical barriers to it as the confined elderly would depend on the young for most essential activities, and a perfect lockdown would not be achieved in a multi-generational household, especially in close quarters such as those found in the low and even middle income neighborhoods common in Brazil. Our results therefore discourage confinement by age as the only exit strategy. We urge Brazilian authorities to take action to prevent virus dissemination in the critical coming weeks.Eqs 21 to 26 are implemented in the likelihood function on the code. If in each run it returns a finite number, the algorithm parses the result, if not it returns a large number (10 20 ) to discard as a bad fit.We limit each parameter using a range cutoff in when feeding the probability function to restrict parameter space. That way, we do not run models with unrealistic physical parameters (e.g. symptomatic going to the hospital in −2 days), and also constrain the known range for the other parameters. The MCMC function feeds on 6 free parameters, 4 fixed parameters and 2 predetermined arrays as presented in Table 3 .Wladimir Lyra, José-Dias do Nascimento, Jr., Jaber Belkhiria, Leandro de Almeida, Pedro Paulo M.

5cac3beb3b1374582a20a14347750381a252fbe6,Case report Multiple cranial nerve palsies in malignant external otitis: A rare presentation of a rare condition,"Malignant external otitis (MEO) is a potentially life-threatening infection of the soft tissues of the external ear, quickly spreading to involve the periosteum and bone of the skull base. The condition typically begins in the outer ear, manifesting with refractory otalgia that irradiates to the frontotemporal and parietal regions, usually worsening in intensity at night, accompanied by smelly otorrhea with purulent aspect [1] . Its extension to the skull base adds severity and results in an increased risk of cranial nerve involvement, with facial nerve palsy being the usual finding [2] . The most common etiologic agent is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a microorganism that is unlikely to cause infections in healthy tissues, but able to initiate an infectious process through small traumatic injuries caused by iatrogenic manipulation in the external ear [1] . This type of infection is mostly described in elderly, diabetic and immunocompromised patients and, considering the high lethality rate, should always be suspected when there is an external otitis in a patient with a known risk factor and in those who do not respond well to the treatment of an apparent uncomplicated external otitis [3] .Even though MEO is a rare disease, it should be recognized by primary care and emergency physicians, who are frequently the first professionals sought by these patients. Thus, with the early diagnosis of MEO, treatment can be promptly instituted, resulting in significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality of this disease [4] . A 65-year-old man with poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension reported progressive otalgia and otorrhea in his left ear for 8 months. He was only treated with symptomatic medications in the emergency services during this time. Five months later, he noticed loss of visual acuity in the left eye and hearing loss in the left ear, progressing soon after with left peripheral facial palsy. During the next two months, he evolved with left eye proptosis (Figs. 1 and 2 ), complete visual loss and ophthalmoplegia (Figs. 1 and 2), in addition to hearing loss in the right ear. He was initially evaluated by a primary care otorhinolaryngologist, who suspected the diagnosis of MEO and initiated ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day. After 7 days he was referred to our tertiary hospital for additional specialized diagnostic and therapeutic evaluations. On physical examination, there was a clear left eye proptosis and blindness, with absent direct photomotor reflex and preserved consensual reflex, impairment of left oculomotor, trochlear and abducent nerves, determining complete ophthalmoplegia, left peripheral facial palsy, complete hearing loss on the left and partial hearing on the right.Considering the severity of the case, the high risk of infectious spread to the brain parenchyma and meninges and the microbiological profile of the hospital, it was opted to switch the antibiotic therapy to meropenem 2 g intravenous infusion every 8 h and vancomycin 1 g intravenous infusion twice a day.Initial computed tomography (CT) of the head showed erosion of the anterior wall of the left external ear conduct and of the left mandible condyle and dehiscence of the external auditory canal, without other bone changes. (Fig. 3) . Besides, there was a bilateral veiling of the mastoid air cells, more pronounced on the left. The magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain revealed a tissue occupying the left superior orbital fissure intraconal fat, with invasion of the left orbit, determining nerve compression (Figs. 4 and 5 ). There was involvement of the left optic, oculomotor, trochlear and abducent nerves, enhancement of the extrinsic ocular muscles and proptosis. Superior ophthalmic veins were preserved bilaterally and there was no evidence of cavernous sinus thrombosis. There was also heterogeneity of the whole sphenoid bone with hyperintensity on T2/FLAIR images and contrast enhancement (Figs. 4 and 5) , tissue thickening and enhancement around the left temporo-mandibular articulation, besides contrast enhancement on the trajectory of the left facial nerve.Ten days after initiation of antibiotics (7 days of oral ciprofloxacin and 3 days of meropenem and vancomycin), the patient underwent left canal wall-up mastoidectomy, with removal of tissue samples for microbiological evaluation, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and fungus. During the surgical procedure, the mastoid cavity was cleaned, an integral ossicular chain was observed, as well as the tympanic membrane and disease-free middle ear. It was also opted for the insertion of ear ventilation tube bilaterally. The external ear canal skin fragments revealed mixed inflammatory infiltrate content with necrosis areas and multinucleated giant cells; the mastoid bone material showed chronic inflammatory infiltrate content. All microbiological tests performed were negative, and this was interpreted as a possible consequence of the early use of antibiotics.The patient had no surgical complications, presented good recover of the right ear hearing capacity after 2 days, but showed no improvements of the neurological deficits nor the left ear hearing function, probably because of the chronicity of the case. Due to clinical stability and normal laboratory parameters, after 7 days of the surgical procedure the antibiotic therapy was switched to ciprofloxacin 400 mg intravenous infusion twice a day with a further objective of oral domiciliar ciprofloxacin, in order to totalize 6 week treatment period. Unfortunately, we have been facing dramatic months of COVID-19 pandemic, causing great apprehension specially over the hospitalized patients. Although the patient in case was not in the COVID-19 hospital section, on the 14th day of hospitalization, he initiated fever, dry cough and evolved after 2 days with dyspnea, motivating oral intubation and transfer to COVID-19 intensive care unit. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed Sars-CoV-2 infection. As an elderly man, with poorly controlled diabetes and in current malignant external otitis treatment, the patient had a poor outcome on this new coronavirus infection and sadly passed away after 10 days. This reflects the actual reality of the world and the difficulty of managing hospitalized patients during this COVID-19 pandemic. First described in 1968 by James R. Chandler [5] , MOE is a lifethreatening infection of the external ear that usually begins in the external auditory conduct and spreads through the skull base, determining a severe osteomyelitis with compromise of surrounding tissues. It typically affects the elderly diabetic patients and in up to 98 % of the cases is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa [1] , an aerobic gram-negative bacteria. More virulent strains produce collagenases and elastases, being responsible for vasculitis and cranial nerve involvement, respectively. Facial nerve is the most frequently involved [3] , followed by glossopharyngeal, vague and accessory nerves [2] . Involvement of the abducent nerve is rare, and even rarer is the affection of the superior orbital fissure and optic foramen, which has only been described in 2013, by Baig et al. [6] . In this scenario, there is damage to the optic, oculomotor, trochlear and abducent nerves, and the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, which may result in ophthalmoplegia, proptosis and vision loss. In our case report, a chronic non-treated otitis externa was followed after months by hearing loss, left eye proptosis with blindness and complete ophthalmoplegia, and left peripheral facial palsy. The clinical evaluation by specialized otolaryngologist and neurologist, followed by MRI, corroborated the diagnosis of MEO with multiple cranial neuropathy, manifested by involvement of the optic, oculomotor, trochlear, abducent and facial nerves. Besides, the patient was elderly and diabetic, which are important risk factors associated with this condition. As mentioned above, orbital commitment with multiple cranial neuropathy is a rare phenotype of MEO which was only described more recently and whose early recognition and treatment are decisive in the patient's prognosis.MOE is a rare, but life-threatening condition, that can evolve with neurological complications. Facial palsy is a well stablished one, but, to our knowledge, multiple cranial nerves evolvement due to orbital fissure invasion is a rare phenotype. Greater recognition of this disease is required by the general practitioner as well as greater caution in the treatment of ear infections, especially in elderly and patients with comorbidities. Guidance on treatment, reassessment and day-to-day care, such as avoiding trauma to the external auditory canal or local humidity, makes a big difference in the treatment of the disease. A written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor-in-Chief of this journal on request.",Brazil,first author,2020-09-05,9

Case Report Oral manifestations in a patient with a history of asymptomatic COVID-19. Case Report CASE REPORT,"SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory coronavirus, zoonotic disease having both bats and pangolins as the most probable origin and intermediate host (Association 2020; Chan et al. 2020) . is believed to be spread through close person-to-person contact (about 2 meters), a distance at which the respiratory droplets from an infected person either symptomatic or asymptomatic that coughs, sneezes, or speaks can spread to other people who do not have adequate barriers.Another route of transmission occurs indirectly when saliva droplets fall on other surfaces, such as the ground and objects made of different materials, and people come into contact with them (Kwok et al. 2015) . Their mortality is independent of their immune status (Mehta et al. 2020) ; the virus is resistant to standard defenses that do not appear to respond efficiently to inflammatory invasion and cytokine storm (Guo et al. 2020 ). Lymphocytopenia and T-cell over-activation with reduction of an effective humoral / cellular immune response have been reported in COVID-19 patients(Dziedzic and Wojtyczka 2020; Xu et al. 2020 ). Dysfunctions such as anosmia and ageusia have been found as inflammation-induced symptoms of COVID-19 (Petrescu et al. 2020 ).Due to the use of intensified therapeutic methods possibly aggravated by SARS-CoV-2, an increase in cases with oropharyngeal symptoms / conditions, dental-oral problems associated with soft tissues, saliva production (dry mouth) as side effects, could be predicted, even after recovering from COVID-19. The Candida albicans is a normal inhabitant in many mouths, diagnostic confirmation of infection is often based on a successful response (i.e., resolution of lesions) to antifungal medications. This form of diagnostic confirmation can be further enhanced by culturing the pathogen, preparing a fungal smear, or even an incisional biopsy (Zegarelli 1993 ).Immunoinflammatory processes have been associated with hyperpigmentation of melanin from the oral mucosa (Chandran et al. 2016) . Different factors produced during inflammation, such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, cytokines, and inflammatory mediators, may play a role in this response and increased melanogenesis (Taylor et al. 2009; Lambert et al. 2019) . Inflammation mediators, such as histamine and arachidonic acid metabolites, trigger melanogenesis (Mackintosh 2001 ) and inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1α induce J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the secretion of melanogenic agents (SCF, HGF, bFGF, endothelin) by keratinocytes (Feller et al. 2014 ). Together, these agents explain the melanin pigmentation that is sometimes seen in association with inflammatory conditions of the skin or oral mucosa (Satomura et al. 2007 ).Physiological melanin pigmentation of the oral mucosa occurs most frequently in the gingiva and does not transgress the mucogingival junction (Meleti et al. 2008) . Pigmentation is more extensive in the anterior part of the mouth than in the posterior part and on the labial / labial surfaces (Feller et al. 2014 ). The objective of this brief article was to report a relevant case of oral manifestations in an asymptomatic patient with COVID-19.40-year-old female patient who works as assistant manager in a bank in New York (USA) who attends the teleconsultation (Cali-Colombia) accompanied by her husband and manifests the presence of reddish plaques on the lower lip and the appearance of dark brown pigmentation in the gum of 8 days of evolution. In the teleconsultation, the patient presented a photo of the lower lip ( Fig.1A) . She is asked for authorization to observe the injury through the mobile phone and the husband is asked to operate the camera and take photographs of different points of the mouth. During the anamnesis the patient indicates that she have been taking the following medications:ibuprofen which is taken occasionally for headache, vitamin D2 (1 pill every week), and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f azithromycin which she took in 2 instances for five days (3 weeks and 1 week prior to the dental teleconsultation) prescribed by his primary care doctor through telehealth, since he had lymphadenopathy at the neck level, in addition to having tested positive for the antibodies (SARS CoV 2 AB IGG Positive) three weeks before the dental teleconsultation and her husband was diagnosed with COVID-19 six weeks before.The patient states that her husband, with whom she cohabits, is a health care worker that had acquired the infection in the hospital by working with patients with Covid-19 at the height of the pandemic in the first half of 2020 in New York. He was tested multiple times presenting a positive RT-PCR tests (Testing was performed using the Cobas 8800 SARS-CoV-2 test.) and positive antibodies for COVID-19 (Testing was performed using the Chemiluminescent Immunoassay). The patient reports that her husband was symptomatic with a fever greater than 38°C and he was in disability for 52 days. minutes, then rinse with water and let the brush dry. The patient is contacted again by dental teleconsultation after 20 days, the oral cavity is verified by telephone and a recovery of the lesions of the lips is observed (Fig. 1B) . She does not present aphthous ulcers and the whitish color of the tongue was significantly reduced (Fig. 1F) . The recent photo, showing the melanin pigmentation in the attached gingiva of the anterior teeth, is compared with a photo taken 6 months before (Figs.1 E, H) . This comparison shows that the patient did not have the pigmentations. It is explained to her that the pigmentation is related by her Afro-descendant origin where this pigmentation is frequent and that the inflammatory process lived in response SARS-CoV-2 could cause the proliferation of melanocytes in that part of his body. It is left under observation for the next control. Oral candida infection has been reported to almost always involve a locally or systemically compromised host (Zegarelli 1993) . Taking into account that Candida albicans is part of the oral microbiome and that there were favorable events for its pathological development, such as the decrease in salivation manifested in the patient by the sensation of dry mouth, in addition to the frequent use of antibiotics and a mild predisposing factor such as the female sex (Zegarelli 1993) and the successful response to nystatin treatment, we can clinically confirm candida infection The hyperpigmentation of the gums in the anterior teeth due to the aesthetic problem that it represents for the patient is the one that causes of most concern. The patient is fair-skinned and At the last follow-up appointment the patient stated: ""I feel happy because the lesions on the lip and tongue disappeared with the treatment, and I will be reviewing the evolution of the gum pigmentation until the next control appointment.""In conclusion, we can affirm that the problems that arise in the oral mucosa in patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection can be monitored through interdisciplinary teleconsultation during the pandemic with the support of information technologies available to many people worldwide, as demonstrated in this case with an asymptomatic patient with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ",Colombia,first author,2020-09-01,9
9faadd502db337db834ec5e19e6bfcf381dcba5c,A vaccine built from potential immunogenic pieces derived from the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein,"by comparing the IC50 of each predicted peptide against random peptides from 66 SWISSPROT database. 67 In addition, binding peptides to HLA-II were also chosen by their potential to induce 68 interferon-gamma (IFN-g) (Fig. 1) , which was evaluated using the IFNepitope server 69 (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/ifnepitope/) [26] . 70 71 BCPRED (http://ailab.ist.psu.edu/bcpred/) [27] was used to predict linear BC epitopes 72 based on several physicochemical properties: hydrophilicity, flexibility, accessibility, and 73 antigenicity propensity (threshold = 1 for each parameter). Simultaneously, the S 74 glycoprotein amino acid sequence was also subjected to iBCE-EL 75 (http://thegleelab.org/iBCE-EL/) [28] and BepiPred-2.0 76 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred/) [29] for additional predictions of linear BC 77 epitopes. 78 79 Molecular docking 80 To evaluate the presentation of the best epitopes in the context of HLA molecules, a 81 molecular docking study was conducted (Fig. 1) . Taking into account that HLA-C*06:02 and HLA-DRB1*01:01 were predicted as common interacting HLA alleles, they were 83 selected for this purpose. 84 The molecular docking simulation process is summarised as follows. First, the best 3D 85 structure of each epitope (9-mer and 15-mer peptides) was obtained from PEPFOLD server 86 (https://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/PEP-FOLD3/) [30] . Second [45] . Three injections were applied four weeks apart as described previously [46] . Furthermore, 12 injections were applied four weeks apart to simulate 140 repeated exposure to potential immunogen. The Simpson index D was used to interpret the 141 diversity of the immune response. A total of 47 T cell epitopes were predicted; however, 8 CTC and 11 THC epitopes were 155 identified as the best (Table 1) . These 19 epitopes showed a potent viral antigenicity-156 ranging from 0.63 to 1.52-and lack of allergenic or toxic residues in their sequences 157 (Table 1) . Moreover, THC epitopes were characterized by their potential capability to 158 induce IFN-g (Table 1 ). Although ""EGFNCYFPLQSYGFQ"" (E47 in Table 1 ) could be 159 categorized as a strong potential THC epitope, it was identified as a probable inductor of 160 toxicity. Therefore, this epitope was not included in the amino acid sequence of the multi-161 epitope vaccine. The selected CTC epitopes (Table 1) A total of 10 linear BC epitopes of varying amino acid lengths were predicted ( Table 2 ).Most of the epitopes showed robust viral antigenicity (≥0.5), as well as, they were 175 identified as non-allergenic and non-toxic (Table 2 ). However, only 7 epitopes were 176 selected for the vaccine design due to they were predicted simultaneously by 3 different 177 web tools (BCPRED, iBCE-EL, and BepiPred-2.0) ( Table 2) . Interestingly, overlapping 178 residues were observed between some linear BC and T cell epitopes. HLA-I and HLA-II alleles were docked with CTC and THC epitopes, respectively, using 184 the Patchdock server, which has been recently applied to successfully dock epitopes from 185 SARS-CoV-2 into immune cell receptors [10] . The HLA allele-viral peptide complexes 186 showed high geometric shape complementarity scores (>6000) [52] similar to controls 187 ( Table 3 ). The inspection on VDM software allowed observing different binding patterns 188 wherein viral peptides rightly interact with the active site residues of the HLA groove in a 189 similar way to control peptides (Fig. 2) . Moreover, several viral peptides (e.g., E15 and 190 E33) formed a bulge that projected from their respective HLA allele ( Fig. 2B and 2C) , 191 which may suggest a more direct interaction with the T cell receptor [18] . To design the amino acid sequence of the multi-epitope vaccine, a total of 26 epitopes (8 195 CTC, 11 THC, and 7 LBC epitopes) were organized using several linkers (Fig. 1) . This 196 sequence is constituted by 437 amino acid residues (Fig. 1) .Of particular note, 6 epitopes selected for the vaccine design (E2, E19, E43, E44, and 198 E45 in Table 1 ; E10 in Table 2 ) harbour residues that are usually involved in the interaction 199 between the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein and hACE2 [49] [50] [51] . For instance, N501-which 200 is present in the amino acid sequence of E19 (Table 1 ) and E10 (Table 2 )-has been 201 recently described as one of the critical hACE2-binding residues in SARS-CoV-2 [51] . The 437 amino acid long vaccine construct was analysed using the PSIPRED server to 210 predict its secondary structure, which identified 316, 70, and 51 amino acids forming coil, 211 helix, and strand regions, respectively (Fig. 3A) .The tertiary structure was subjected to refinement using the GalaxyRefine server. The 213 output showed five potential models. Model 1 (Fig. 3B) analysis. In this regard, the Ramachandran plot (Fig. 3C) showed that 86.4% of residues 217 were located in most favoured regions, whereas the remaining residues were observed in 218 additional allowed (11.7%), generously allowed (1.2%), and disallowed (0.6%) regions. In 219 addition, the Z-score value (-2.35) (Fig. 3D) suggests that the vaccine structure is similar to 220 native proteins of comparable size. Three conformational BC epitopes (CE) were predicted using Ellipro (Fig. 4) . These CE 223 showed high probability scores-CE1: 0.914, CE2: 0.841 and CE3: 0.821, suggesting a 224 considerable accessibility for antibodies (Fig. 4) . Likewise, these results also confirm the 225 immunogenic potential of the multi-epitope vaccine construct. viruses [18] , and macrophages were observed (Fig. 6 ). Regarding the adaptive immune 235 response, CTC and THC populations showed a proliferative burst, effector cell generation, 236 and a dramatic cell number contraction (Fig. 6) . Importantly, IL-2, which is necessary for T 237 cell activation and optimal proliferation [18] , was amplified after each dose (Fig. 6 ).Moreover, the vaccine model increased BC and plasma cell populations, particularly 239 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG1 isotypes (Fig. 6) . In this regard, titres of IgM, IgG1, 240 and IgG2 were higher in the secondary and tertiary response compared to primary response 241 (Fig. 6 ). Of note, immunogen concentrations decreased after antibody response (Fig. 6 ).Notably, repeated exposure with 12 injections (given 4 weeks apart) increased the IgG1 243 levels and stimulated CTC and THC populations (Fig. S1 ). Taken Spain, Sweden, USA, UK, etc., (Fig. 7) .Immunoinformatics represents a valuable tool whereby the limitations in the selection of 257 appropriate antigens and immunodominant epitopes may be overcome [17] . Previous in 258 silico-based reports have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein contains potential 259 epitopes [8] [9] [10] [11] . Therefore, researchers have recently attempted to design epitope-based 260 vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 [10, 11] . Despite these relevant contributions, one 261 group only used T cell epitopes and did not include BC epitopes [10] , which are 262 fundamental players in antiviral immune response [18] . The second work, on the other 263 hand, considered several viral membrane proteins, including the S glycoprotein, to 264 identified probable T and BC epitopes [11] . Although the predicted epitopes showed good 265 immunogenic potential, the vaccine does not target S glycoprotein RBM [11] . In the 266 present study, highly potential B and T cell epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein 267 were predicted and the best selected to design a high-quality multi-epitope vaccine 268 candidate. Remarkably, this vaccine harbours 2 epitopes (E19 in Table 1 and E10 in Table   269 2) that could evoke immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 RBM-the main responsible 270 for virus entry into human cells [4, 51] , whereas 4 epitopes (E43, E44, E45, and E46 in 271 [4] .The T cell epitopes included in the vaccine sequence accomplish with relevant requisites 275 to design a suitable multi-epitope vaccine candidate. Firstly, they showed a marked 276 antigenicity, immunogenicity, and lack of allergenic or toxic residues. Secondly, the THC 277 epitopes were predicted as potent inductors of IFN-g-a crucial cytokine for CTC 278 activation [18] . Thirdly, both CTC and THC epitopes properly interacted with the groove of 279 HLA-I and HLA-II alleles, respectively, which is in agreement with other computer-based reports [54] , thereby suggesting that the T cell epitopes identified and selected in the 281 present study could be successfully presented in the context of HLA molecules.The purpose of an adjuvant is to make a vaccine ""detectable"" for antigen-presenting 283 cells such as dendritic cells [55] . In this regard, adjuvants approved or in clinical trials 284 (NCT01609257) for virus-like particle-based vaccines are constituted by TLR4 agonists 285 [55] . Here, the TLR4 adjuvant known as RS09 [33] was included in the multi-epitope 286 vaccine sequence. The molecular docking simulation showed that the multi-epitope vaccine 287 rightly interacts with this innate immune receptor in a similar way to previous works [35] .288Notably, this study shows, by immunoinformatics simulations, the induction of both convalescent patients [57] . These immune responses were directed to the SARS-CoV-2 S 299 glycoprotein [57] .This work was limited by A) the population coverage analysis did not include some 301 countries, particularly from Africa, Central America, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia.This was mainly due to data not available concerning the HLA allele frequencies.

6bba072a679335d1cabffb556f6f5ba351a53c40,City size and the spreading of COVID-19 in Brazil,"Human activities have become increasingly concentrated in urban areas. A direct consequence of this worldwide urbanization process is that more people are living in cities than in rural regions since 2007 [1] , and projections indicate that the world urban population could reach more than 90% by the end of this century [2] . Besides being increasingly urbanized, we live in an unprecedentedly connected, and highly mobile world with air passengers exceeding 4 billion in 2018 [3] . On the one hand, a highly connected and highly urbanized society brought us innovation, economic growth, more access to education and healthcare; on the other, it has also lead to pollution, environmental degradation, privacy concerns, more people living in substandard conditions, and suitable conditions for dissemination of infectious diseases over the globe. In particular, the emergence of infectious disease outbreaks has significantly increased over time, and the majority of these events are caused by pathogens originating in wildlife [4] , which in turn has been associated with changes in environmental conditions and land use, agricultural practices, and the rise of large human population settlements [5] . The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) seems to fit well the previous context as it was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019, an influential Chinese city exceeding 11 million inhabitants, and apparently originated from the recombination of bat and Malayan pangolin coronaviruses [6] . The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) initially spread in Mainland China but rapidly caused outbreaks in other countries, making the World Health Organization first declare a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"" in January 2020, and in mid-March, the outbreak was reclassified as a pandemic. As of 16 August 2020, over 21.2 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in almost all countries, and the worldwide death toll exceeds 761 thousand people [7] . The COVID-19 pandemic poses unprecedented health and economic threats to our society, and understanding its spreading patterns may find important factors for mitigating or controlling the outbreak.Recent works have focused on modeling the initial spreading of COVID- 19 [8] or the fatality curves [9], projecting the outbreak peak and hospital utilization [10] , understanding the effects of mobility [11] , demography [12] , travel restrictions [13] , behavior change on the virus transmission [14] , mitigation strategies [15] , non-pharmaceutical interventions [16] , networkbased strategies for social distancing [17] , among many others. Despite the increasing surge of scientific investigations on the subject, little attention has been paid to understanding the effects of city size on spreading patterns of cases and deaths by COVID-19 in urban areas. The idea that size (as measured by population) affects different city indicators has been extensively studied and can be summarized by the urban scaling hypothesis [18] [19] [20] [21] . This theory states that urban indicators are non-linearly associated with city population such that socio-economic indicators tend to present increasing returns to scale [18, 22, 23] , infrastructure indicators often display economy of scale [18, 19] , and quantities related to individual needs usually scale linearly with city population [18, 19] .Urban scaling studies of health-related quantities have shown that the incidence and mortality of diseases are non-linearly related to the city population [24] [25] [26] [27] . Despite the existence of several exceptions [27] , noninfectious diseases (such as diabetes) are usually less prevalent in large cities, while infectious diseases (such as AIDS) are relatively more common in large urban areas. This different behavior is likely to reflect the fact that people living in large cities tend to have proportionally more contacts and a higher degree of social interactions than those living in small towns [19, 28] . Within this context, the recent work of Stier, Berman, and Bettencourt [29] has indicated that large cities in the United States experienced more pronounced growth rates of COVID-19 cases during the first weeks after the introduction of the disease. Similarly, Cardoso and Gonçalves [30] found that the per capita contact rate of COVID-19 increases with the size and density of cities in United States, Brazil and Germany. These findings have serious consequences for the evolution of COVID-19 and suggest that large metropolises may become infection hubs with potentially higher and earlier peaks of infected people. Investigating whether this behavior generalizes to other places and how different quantities such as the number of cases and deaths scale with city size are thus important elements for a better understanding of the spreading of COVID-19 in urban areas.Here we investigate how population size is associated with cases and deaths by COVID-19 in Brazilian cities. Brazil is the sixth most populous country in the world, with over 211 million people, of which more than 85% live in urban areas. While it is likely that the novel coronavirus was already circulating in Brazil in early February 2020 [31] , the first confirmed case in the country dates back to 26 February 2020, in the city of São Paulo. Between the first case and 12 August 2020, Brazil has confirmed 3,088,670 cases of COVID-19 (second-largest number) spread out over 98.9% of the 5,570 Brazilian cities. This disease caused 102,817 deaths (second-largest number) with 3,892 cities reporting at least one casualty as of 12 August 2020.We start by briefly presenting our data set (see Methods for details). Our investigations rely on the daily reports published by the Health Offices of each of the 27 Brazilian federative units. These daily reports update the number of confirmed cases (Y c ) and the number of deaths (Y d ) caused by COVID-19 in every Brazilian city from 25 February 2020 (date of the first case in Brazil) to 12 August 2020 (date of our last update). From these data, we create time series of the number of cases Y c (t c ) for each city, where t c refers to the number of days since the first two daily cases reported in each city. Similarly, we create time series of the number of deaths Y d (t d ), where t d refers to the number of days since the first two daily deaths reported in each city. By doing so, we group all cities according to their stage of disease propagation (as measured by t c or t d ) to investigate the evolution of allometric relationships between total cases or deaths and city population. We have also considered different number of daily cases or deaths as the reference point, and our results are robust against different choices (from one to seven daily cases or daily deaths, see the number of cases is well described by a power-law function of the city populationwhere β c is the so-called urban scaling exponent [18] . Similarly, Fig 1B shows the association between the number of casualties and the city population on logarithmic scale (logY d versus logP) for different numbers of days since two daily deaths first reported (t d = 15, 50, 85 and 120 days). Again, the results indicate that the number of deaths is approximated by a powerfunction of the city populationwhere β d represents the urban scaling exponent for the number of deaths.The results of Fig 1 also show the adjusted allometric relationships (dashed lines) and the best fitting scaling exponents β c and β d (see Methods for datails). These exponents exhibit an increasing trend with time so that β c and β d exceed one after some number of days after the first two daily cases or deaths. This dynamic behavior is better visualized in Fig 2, where we depict β c and β d as a function of the number of days since the first two daily cases (t c ) or deaths (t d ). The scaling exponent for the number of cases β c is sub-linear (β c < 1) during the first four months and appears to approach a super-linear plateau (β c > 1) as the number of days t c further increases. The dynamic behavior of the scaling exponent for deaths β d is similar to β c ; however, β d appears to be approaching a plateau larger than the one observed for β c .The evolution of the scaling exponents for cases and deaths indicates that small cities are proportionally more affected by COVID-19 during the first four months. However, this initial apparent advantage of living in large cities vanishes with time, and become a disadvantage after about four months. This is more evident by estimating the number of cases per capita from Eq (1), that is, Y c /P � P β c −1. Similarly, we can estimate the number of deaths per capita from Eq (2), yielding Y d /P � P β d −1. Thus, we expect the number of COVID-19 cases or deaths per capita to decrease with the city population if β c < 1 and β d < 1; conversely, these per capita numbers are expected to increase with the city population if β c > 1 and β d > 1. For instance, because β c � 0.77 and β d � 0.85 after 75 days since the first two daily cases or deaths, the number of cases and deaths per capita decreases with population as Y c /P � P −0.23 and Y c /P � P −0.15 . At those particular values of t c and t d , an 1% rise in the population is associated with a �0.23% decrease in the incidence of COVID-19 cases and �0.15% reduction in the incidence of deaths. In a concrete example for t c = t d = 75 days, we expect a metropolis such as São Paulo (with �12 million people) to have �54% less cases and �39% less deaths per capita than a medium-sized city such as Maringá/PR (with �420 thousand people, �1/30 of São Paulo), which in turn is expected to have �41% less cases and �29% less deaths per capita than a small-sized city such as Paranaíba/MS (with �42 thousand people, �1/10 of Maringá).However, both scaling exponents increase with time, such that this urban advantage vanishes and become a disadvantage during the long course of the pandemic. By considering our latest estimates for the scaling exponents, we find β c � 1.04 (t c = 144 days) and β d � 1.12 (t d = 120 days). Thus, at these particular values of t c and t d , we expect the number of cases per capita to slightly increase with population (Y c /P � P 0.04 ) and the number of fatalities per capita to increase with population as Y d /P � P 0.12 . Thus, for β d � 1.12 at t d = 120 days, we expect a metropolis such as São Paulo (�12 million people) to have �50% more deaths per capita than Maringá/PR (�420 thousand people), which in turn is expected to have �32% more deaths per capita than Paranaíba/MS (�42 thousand people). Figs 8-14 in S1 Appendix show that the scaling relations for number of cases and deaths per capita support the previous discussions.The latest estimates of β c found for cases of COVID-19 are smaller than those reported for the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic in Brazil (β c � 1.2) and HIV in Brazil and United States (β c � 1.4) [27] . Similarly to what we observe for the cases of COVID-19, the allometric exponent for HIV cases in Brazil was initially sub-linear during the 1980s, became super-linear after the 1990s, and started to approach a super-linear plateau after the 2000s [27] . However, the evolution of the allometry for HIV has been much slower than what we have observed for the COVID-19. Another interesting point reported by Rocha, Thorson, and Lambiotte [27] is that the number of H1N1 cases in Brazil started to scale linearly with city population in 2010 (one year after the first outbreak). These authors also argue that this reduction in the scaling exponent possibly reflects a better response for the spread of H1N1 after the pandemic outbreak. If the behavior observed in the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic generalizes (at least in part) for the current COVID-19 pandemic, we would expect a decrease in values of β c in the future. The lastest estimates of β d for COVID-19 deaths are larger than those reported for diabetes (β d � 0.8), heart attack (β d � 1) and cerebrovascular accident (β d � 1) in Brazil after the 2000s [27] . Conversely, scaling exponents related to disease mortality in Brazil displayed a decreasing trend with time, and values as high as 1.25 were observed for diabetes in 1996 (β d � 1.22) and heart attack in 1981 (β d � 1.25) [27] . The convergence of these exponents to linear or sub-linear regimes may reflect the increasing access to medical facilities in urban areas [27] .Based on currently available data (Fig 2) , it is hard to confidently assert whether the values of β c and β d will remain larger than one during the long-term course of the pandemic. However, the persistence of this behavior indicates large cities are likely to be more affected at the end of the COVID-19 outbreak. Part of this behavior may be due to large cities testing for COVID-19 proportionally more than small ones. Results for the United States indicate that more rural states have lower testing rates and detect disproportionately fewer cases of COVID-19 [32] . As Brazilian cities are likely to suffer from this bias, we would expect a decrease in the scaling exponent β c after the observed increasing trend depending on the magnitude of this effect (that is, as small cities increase their testing capabilities, their number of cases tend to increase and bend the scaling law downwards).On the other hand, it is clearer that large cities were proportionately less affected during the initial months (since the first two daily cases or deaths) of the pandemic. We believe there are at least two possible explanations for this behavior. First, it may reflect an ""increasing urban advantage"" where the larger the city, the more access to medical facilities and so the chance of receiving more appropriate treatment against the coronavirus disease. A second cause can be associated with age demographic changes with the city population; specifically, a smaller proportion of older adults at high risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19 leads to a reduced number of deaths per capita. Another possibility is that the strategies and policy responses of large and small cities to COVID-19 are different, which in turn may lead to different efficiency in containing the pandemic. These responses are highly heterogeneous at the national level [33, 34] as well as among counties in the United States [35] . Among these three possibilities, we did not explore the possible effects of different city strategies against the COVID-19, but in light of the findings for the United States [35] , this effect is likely to play an important role in the Brazilian case and may deserve further investigation.To test for an increasing urban advantage for the treatment of COVID-19 during the initial spread of the disease, we investigate the scaling relation between the number of hospital intensive care unit (ICU) beds and city population. Because critically ill patients frequently require mechanical ventilation [36, 37] , the number of ICU beds has proved to be crucial for the treatment of COVID-19. Fig 3A shows the allometric relationship between the number of ICU beds from private and public health systems (Y icu , as of April 2020) and the population, where a super-linear relationship emerges with scaling exponent β icu � 1.16. The super-linear scaling of ICU beds indicates that large Brazilian cities are better structured to deal with critically ill patients, which in turn may partially explain the reduction of deaths per capita with the city size during the initial three-four months since the first two daily deaths. It is worth noting that the Brazilian Public Unified Health System (Sistema Ú nico de Saúde-SUS) is decentralized and composed of ""health regions"", contiguous groups of cities usually formed by a large city and its neighboring cities [38] . Cities within the same health region may share medical services, which may in turn partially explain the reduction of the structural advantages of large urban areas during the long-term course of the pandemic.We have also investigated how age demographic distribution changes with city population. Estimates have shown that the case fatality rate of COVID-19 is substantially higher in people aged more than 60 years (0.32% for those younger than 60 years versus 6.5% for those older than 60 years [39] ). Thus, the age demographic of cities represents an important factor for the number of deaths caused by COVID-19. Fig 3B and 3C show how the number of people older (P hr , the high-risk population) and younger (P lr , the low-risk population) than 60 years change with the total population (P). We note that the high-risk population increases sub-linearly with city size with an exponent β hr � 0.91, while the low-risk population scales linearly (β lr � 1) with city size. This result shows that large cities have a lower prevalence of adults older than 60 years, such that a 1% increase in city population is associated with a 0.91% rise in the high-risk population. In a more concrete example, we expect a city with one million people to have proportionally �19% fewer adults older than 60 years when compared with a city of 100 thousand inhabitants. Thus, a low prevalence of elderly in large urban areas may also partially explain the initial reduction of the number of deaths per capita with the increase of city population.In addition to addressing the urban scaling of cases and deaths of COVID-19, we have investigated associations between the growth rates of cases and deaths and the city population (Figs 16-22 in S1 Appendix). As mentioned, the work of Stier, Berman, and Bettencourt [29] shows that the initial growth rates of COVID-19 cases in metropolitan areas of the United States scale as a power-law function of the population with an exponent between 0.11 and 0.20. By using our data and as detailed in Methods, we have estimated the growth rates of cases (r c ) and deaths (r d ) for Brazilian cities. In agreement with the United States case, our results also indicate that COVID-19 cases initially grow faster in large cities (Fig 23 in S1 Appendix) , such that r c � P b r c with b r c between �0.1 and �0.3 during the first three months (t c ≲ 90, Fig 23 in S1 Appendix). We also found similar behavior for the growth rate in the number of deaths r d , where a power-law relation r d � P b r d is a reasonable description for the empirical data with a scaling exponent b r d between �0.1 and �0.5 during the first three months (t d ≲ 90, Fig 23 in S1 Appendix).The growth rate depicts a more instantaneous picture of the COVID-19 spreading process, and its association with size may change during the long-term evolution of the pandemic. These changes may reflect the different actions taken by each city to face the COVID-19 pandemic and other particularities affecting the COVID-19 spreading. For the spreading of COVID-19 in the United States, Heroy [40] has reported that large cities appear to enter in an exponential spreading regime earlier than small ones. To better investigate these possibilities in our data, we have estimated the average relationship between the growth rate of cases (r c ) and deaths (r d ) and the city rank s (s = 1 represents the largest city in data, s = 2 the second-largest, and so on) at different periods. Fig 4A shows the results for the growth rates in the number of cases (r c ). In agreement with the power-law association between r c and the city population (Figs 16-22 in S1 Appendix), we note that lower values of the city rank s are associated with higher growth rates r c in the initial days since the first two daily cases. However, as time goes by, the growth rate of cases starts to decrease in large cities (low-rank values) and to increase in small ones (high-rank values). This result appears to agree with the findings of Heroy [40] in the sense that there is a delay in the emergence of high growth rates of cases between large and small cities. Fig 4B shows the same analysis for growth rate in the number of deaths r d . While we also observe a decrease in r d for large cities and increase for small ones, the differences in r d are less pronounced than in r c . These findings also emerge when investigating the scaling exponents associated with the growth rates of cases (b r c ) and deaths (b r d ). The results of Fig 23 in S1 Appendix show that these exponents start to decrease around t c � t d � 100 days and become negative in our latest estimates. It is worth remembering that the time t c (or t d ) is measured in days since the first two daily cases (or first two daily deaths) for each city; thus, the results of Fig 4 do not reflect delays in the emergence of the first case in each city.We have studied scaling relations for the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Brazilian cities. Similarly to what happens for other diseases, we found the number of cases and deaths to be power-law related to the city population. During the initial three-four months since the first two daily cases or deaths, we found a sub-linear association between cases and deaths by COVID-19, meaning that the per capita numbers of cases and deaths tend to decrease with population in this initial stage of the pandemic. We believe this behavior can be partially explained by an ""increasing urban advantage"" where large cities have proportionally more ICU beds than small ones. In addition, changes in age demography with city size show that large cities have proportionally less elderly people who are at high risk of developing severe illness and dying from COVID-19. This may also partially explain the initial reduction of fatalities per capita with the city population. In addition, we have argued that the strategies and policy responses of large and small cities to COVID-19 may also be different and lead to different efficiency in containing the pandemic.However, we found that this ""urban advantage"" vanishes in the long-term course of the pandemic, such that the association between cases and deaths by COVID-19 with population becomes super-linear in our latest estimates since the first two daily cases or deaths. Thus, the persistence of this pattern indicates that large cities are expected to be proportionally more affected at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. This result is in line with the findings for other infectious diseases [25, 27] and probably reflects the existence of a higher degree of interaction between people in large cities [19, 28] . Because social distancing is currently the only available measure to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, our results suggest that large cities may require more severe degrees of social distancing policies.In agreement with the results for metropolitan areas in the United States [29] , we have found that large cities usually display higher growth rates in the number of cases during the initial spread of the COVID-19. However, our results also show that these growth rates tend to decrease in large cities and to increase in small ones in the long-term course of the pandemic. This behavior suggests the existence of a delay in the emergence of high growth rates between large and small cities. Similar behavior was also found in the United States [40] , where large cities appear to enter an exponential growth regime earlier than small towns. The existence of this delay suggests that the initial slow-spreading pace of the COVID-19 in small cities is likely to be a transient behavior.Together with the recent findings of Stier-Berman-Bettencourt [29] and Heroy [40] for the United States, as well as those of Cardoso and Gonçalves [30] for United States, Brazil and Germany, our results suggest that social distancing policies and other actions against the pandemic should take into account the non-linear effects of city size on the spreading of the COVID-19.The primary data set used in this work was collected from the brasil.io API [41] . This API retrieves information from COVID-19 daily reports published by the Health Offices of each of the 27 Brazilian federations (26 states and one federation district) and makes it freely available. This data set comprises information about the cumulative number of cases and deaths of COVID-19 from 25 February 2020 (date of the first case in Brazil) until 12 August 2020 (date of our last update) for all Brazilian cities reporting at least one case of COVID-19. The brasil.io API also provides population data of Brazilian cities, which in turn relies on population estimates for the year 2019 released by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). There is a total of 5,507 Brazilian cities with at least one reported case of COVID-19 on 12 August 2020, corresponding to 98.9% of the country's total number of cities. In addition, 3,892 cities suffered casualties from this disease, representing 69.9% of the total. To ensure that our estimates rely on at least 50 cities, we consider a suitable upper threshold for the time series length (Fig 24 in S1 Appendix) . The data about age demographics refer to the latest Brazilian census that took place in 2010, while the data about the number of ICU beds are from April 2020. These two data sets are maintained and made freely available by the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Public Health System (DATASUS) [42] .Urban scaling [18] usually refers to a power-law association between a city property Y and the city population P, and it is expressed bywhere Y 0 is a constant and β is the urban scaling exponent. Eq (3) can be linearized by taking the logarithmic on both sides, that is,where log Y and log P are the dependent and independent variables of the corresponding linear relationship between log Y and log P. We have estimated the power-law exponents in Eq (3) by using the probabilistic approach of Leitão et al. [43] . Specifically, we have found the probabilistic model with lognormal fluctuations and where the fluctuations in log Y are independent of P to be the best description of our data in the majority of scaling laws. Thus, we assume these lognomal fluctuations in all adjusting procedures in order to estimate the values of β. It is worth mentioning that this maximum-likelihood estimate for scaling exponents is analogous to the one obtained via usual least-squares with the log-transformed variables (log Y versus log P).Let us consider that x t (t = 1, . . ., n) represents the cumulative number of cases (Y c ) or the cumulative number of deaths (Y d ) for COVID-19 in a given city at time t (number of days since first case t c or death t d ). The logarithmic growth rate r t at time t is defined aswhere τ is a time delay. If we assume the numbers of cases or deaths to initially increase exponentially (x t � e rt , where r is the exponential growth rate), r t represents an estimate for the growth rate of this initial exponential behavior (r). We have estimated r t for the number of cases (r c ) and deaths (r d ) up to values of t c and t d ensuring a sample size of at least 50 cities for the allometric relations between these growth rates and the city population (Fig 24 in S1 Appendix). All results in the main text were obtained for τ = 14 but our discussion is robust for τ between 9 and 21 days (Figs 25-38 in S1 Appendix).Supporting information S1 Appendix.

4bd0d9a67e6be50c139c01cc03c852f28178ca59,"C O M M E N TA RY Targeted Prevention of COVID-19, a Strategy to Focus on Protecting Potential Victims, Instead of Focusing on Viral Transmission","Some countries have already been through the first wave (eg, Spain) of SARS-CoV -2 infection-causing COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) while others are hoping for the first wave to end soon (eg, the U.S.A.). The infection control strategy used has been ""untargeted"" because it placed the entire population on a socioeconomic lockdown with freedom-deprivation measures including travel bans, flight cancelations between countries, and business closure. Governments are doing what they can to control the pandemic while their economies are crippled including the shutdown of globally inter-dependent supply chains and plummeting stock markets with millions of people losing their jobs. These are some examples of how this strategy has ""shaken"" the socio-economic pillars of the society that sustain the same lives that the lockdown is supposed to save.The World Bank has forecasted a 5.2% contraction in global GDP in 2020. 1 In fact, the direct economic loss caused by the lockdown-coupled with public spending in unemployment payments, bailout of major corporations such as airline companies, compensation and stimulus packages for small and medium enterprises among other measures-might reduce resource availability for healthcare in the future, which in turn might lead to the loss of more lives in some countries. 2 However, despite all of these strict control measures and economic sacrifices by their populations, about a half a million lives across the globe have already been lost, and new cases are still surging on a global scale. 3 One study estimated that the lockdown may have averted 3.1 million deaths from COVID-19 across 11 European countries. This same work suggests that the risk of a second wave is real when lockdown measures are lifted. 4 This study points out that countries are very far from achieving herd immunity because the first wave has infected fewer than 4% of their populations. In other words, there is a risk of losing the lives that were saved in the earlier lockdown if a new wave is not controlled again through another lockdown. What the lockdowns may have done is simply delayed deaths in the absence of vaccination. Can countries really afford more lockdowns? Can a tourism-based economy such as Spain, which may have already suffered a contraction of 12.8% of its GDP 5 afford a new lockdown?During the initial exposure, governments did not have all the required scientific data when the lockdown measures cascaded into their countries due to travel restrictions enforced across borders. Now that we have morbimortality data related to COVID-19, we can plan an alternative strategy before the second wave. The first experience has shown that the lockdown strategy is not meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19 permanently in the absence of an effective vaccine. Indeed, herd immunity cannot be achieved unless we perpetuate lockdowns, which is unviable from both a social and economic standpoint. Experience does show that lockdowns have played an effective primary role in regulating the demand for health services. The question to ask now is, ""Can we flatten the demand curve and keep it within the health system capacity without destroying the economy until an effective vaccine is available?"" Some countries have gone to the other extreme via a diagonally opposite strategy based on protecting the economy at the cost of higher infection and mortality rates. For example, Brazil had just 50 cases of COVID-19 on 11 March 2020 but in just 63 days this reached 177,589 cases 6 and 1,146,906 as of June 24, 2020, with 52,645 deaths. 3 It is unimaginable how many more lives need to be lost for this strategy to take effect by creating the necessary herd immunity in its population. This Paper Proposes a Middle Way: the strategy of ""Targeted Prevention."" We hypothesize that it is possible to save lives by protecting the vulnerable as well as the economy. This will allow the productive population to work, consume, and sustain the economy. This methodology is a comparative literature review for different strategies, and the creation of a test scenario for estimating the percent of the vulnerable population that would have to be controlled to implement the proposed ""Targeted Prevention"" strategy that only governments can validate.When COVID-19 began in Wuhan, their government acted decisively against their socio-economic system to contain the virus. Such a reaction was taken because nothing was known about the disease at first: how the virus spreads, its mortality rates, and who it kills. Although we still have some unanswered questions even after the Chinese Center for Disease Control had shared its data, we now know something very important about the virus-who it can potentially kill if infection is not prevented. 7 Another study estimates that 1.7 billion people comprising 22% of the global population have at least one underlying condition that puts them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 if infected. One estimate suggests that 349 million people (4% of the global population) are at high risk of severe COVID-19 and would require hospital admission if infected. 8 This information cannot be ignored in our strategy used to control the infection. Our prevention strategy design has to ""guard"" the potential victims but not the entire public.Indeed, we also know that 80% of the population has mild symptoms and their lives are not at risk. Thus, our strategy is a ""targeted prevention"" on the remaining 20% of the population, which is where our 4% potential victims are concentrated. Instead of focusing our efforts on the entire population-most of whom will not reach lifethreatening conditions-we could focus our energy and resources on potential victims. We know that elderly people are the most at-risk (people of 70 years or above). We also know the mortality is high in patients with comorbidity conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and in patients who are immunosuppressed. We also know that children are at less risk because there was not a single death in children below 10 years of age in the Chinese data. 7 A recent study conducted in Europe showed that children can indeed be infected by SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19. 9 The study showed that 19 out of 21 children and adolescents (range 3.7-16.6 years of age) admitted in hospitals with features of Kawasaki disease tested positive for IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2, but all of them were safely discharged after an average of 8 days (range 5-17). Another study evaluated 48 children admitted in the PICU (Pediatric Intensive Care Unit) in the US and Canada and showed that SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe illness in children, but the mortality was found to be far less frequent compared to adults (2 deaths). This work concluded that the important cause of COVID-19 in children was also found to be prehospital comorbidity 10 due to possible specific congenital background.It is paradoxical that in our lockdown strategy, we let our elderly die, often alone, in nursing homes and residences because we did not have a plan to protect them by providing additional staff or personal protective equipment for the workers there. Nor did we perform sufficient tests or treatment efforts for vulnerable groups. Rather, we spent energy and resources in preventing people from leaving their homes! If we had designed a ""Targeted Prevention"" strategy to quarantine our elderly and others with comorbid conditions of all age groups, then we might be able to let non-vulnerable individuals to do business as usual. Contact tracing is not possible in community spread-especially if 80% of cases are asymptomatic. Rather, we should focus our efforts on isolating and controlling the vulnerable population; this can prevent them from getting ill using strict preventive protocols.To develop this new ""Targeted Prevention"" strategy, a possible scenario was created with real data to estimate how many people need to be controlled if only the vulnerable population is considered. Data from Catalonia region of Spain with a population of 7.5 M people were used. The population was classified into two hypothetical groups: 1) a non-vulnerable group that would be expected to transmit the virus without getting sick enough to be hospitalized, and 2) a vulnerable group that might develop COVID-19 including some who might require intensive care; the potential mortality lies within this group. Demographic and healthcare databases 11 available in Catalonia were used to identify how many people are really vulnerable to developing serious COVID-19 requiring hospitalization if infected with SARS-CoV-2 based on two criteria: 1) vulnerable age and 2) vulnerable comorbidity conditions. The total number of potentially vulnerable people present in the region was estimated based on vulnerable age groups and on the prevalence of patients with heart disease and respiratory disorders, patients under cancer treatment and other immunesuppressed conditions, and patients with uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes. 7,11-15 Data on these criteria overlapped to a certain extent, and total vulnerable population was graphically represented for all criteria (Figure 1 ).Although the existing literature is inconclusive for children with some comorbid conditions such as asthma, 16 for precautions, they were also considered to be part of the vulnerable population. However, data are unavailable in the literature related to any specific congenital background that may be causing COVID-19 with features of Kawasaki disease. Vulnerable populations at risk of getting COVID-19 using the age criterion was estimated to be 1,099,000. The population under vulnerable comorbidity conditions below 70 years of age was 650,000 approximately. This meant that the total target number was 1,749,000 in a regional total population of 7,500,000, which is 23% of the total population of Catalonia. This percentage coincides with an independent global study 8 in which 22% of the global population was estimated to be vulnerable of getting COVID-19.To implement ""Targeted Prevention"" strategy for the vulnerable group, the authorities need to develop and update their evidence-based guidelines for a surveillance program as more and more scientific data become available on the natural history of COVID-19. The following are examples of items on such a surveillance program:• Identify individuals that belong to this group (in Catalonian health database-all of them can be traced with legally required data protection). • Implement strict social distancing and travel restrictions without restricting physical exercise and family interactions as long as obligatory social distancing can be monitored. able, they will be most indicated for this group and should be given maximum priority. • Outsiders interacting with the vulnerable group must follow strict social distancing, mask use, and hand hygiene. • Healthcare and social workers including employees of nursing homes and residences and other frontline workers such as police, supermarket employees, cleaning staff, public transport employees, among others, need to be protected to minimize the absenteeism that the virus may cause even if their lives may not be at risk due to age and comorbidity criteria. All frontline workers need to be provided with n95, n99, or n100 masks (and other personal protective equipment as needed) depending on the tasks performed and in accordance with the updated recommendations of the scientific community such as CDC (Center for Disease Control), U.S.A. 17 If any of these comply with the age or comorbidity criterion to belong to the vulnerable group, then obviously they should be relieved from their responsibilities and be included in the vulnerable group.Hypothetically, several benefits can be expected if this strategy is implemented and governments need to validate them. This Targeted Prevention strategy has the potential to be more effective (fewer cases and mortality), more efficient (fewer resources for infection prevention), and less disruptive to our economies:The strategy applies surveillance on the vulnerable group, and it has the potential to 1) protect the vulnerable from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 2) increase their survival rate if they do contract the virus because their comorbid conditions are controlled/improved through proactive medical visits. The 4% of the population under risk 8 of becoming seriously ill is within this vulnerable group and will be targeted for surveillance. Therefore, this strategy is proactive and can reduce overall cases and case mortality versus a lockdown strategy where people go to hospital when they are already infected or have symptoms of COVID-19.While a lockdown would indiscriminately control 100% of the population with correspondingly grave economic consequences, the ""Targeted Prevention"" strategy would reduce that to mere 23% of the population. The target group comprises citizens who are probable ""frequent users"" of the health system because of their age and comorbid conditions, which means that it is more efficient to establish surveillance on them using the primary healthcare network, social workers, and NGOs (nongovernmental organization) depending on the country and its health system. In addition, proactive testing is economically viable (only 4-10% of the population may need it versus testing the entire country). Even when an effective vaccine is available, it may not be viable to vaccinate the entire population of the whole planet within next few years; however, the vaccine will be most indicated for this group who has been readily identified. These targeted approaches should not only reduce resources needed but also spend them where they are most needed.Most people in the vulnerable group are retired, and therefore there will be minimal disruption to the society if they are under surveillance or lockdown. The most productive workforce will be in the non-vulnerable group, which is 77% of the population-this group can continue to actively participate in the productive economy because they have a very low risk of becoming ill with COVID-19. They can perform social distancing when possible, use masks when social distancing is not possible, and use frequent hand hygiene. If such recommendations are not followed, then they may contract the SARS-CoV-2 virus and increase absenteeism, but this will not disrupt the economy. If they contract the virus, they will contribute toward achieving herd immunity, as the chances of them becoming seriously ill with COVID-19 are very low. In any case, if they interact with people in the vulnerable group such as their parents, grandparents, etc., then they need to comply with strict social distancing, mask use, and hand hygiene. According to this strategy, once the target population is identified and the prevention measures are designed, the non-vulnerable group is free to carry on with their societal duties with only recommendations of social distancing, masks when social distancing is not possible, and hand hygiene. Employees need to be encouraged to take time off from work if they are not feeling well and to receive medical advice as needed. People can travel and enjoy freedom as before the pandemic. In this strategy, even schools can reopen (so parents can go to work), but school administrations can be empowered to decide depending on possible clusters and risks. Obviously, children with comorbid conditions will be added to the vulnerable group, and they will have to have home-based study programs and protected using special surveillance.Lockdown measures have been effective in slowing down infection rates and creating waves that regulate the demand for health services. Lockdown can keep the demand within the capacity of the health system if well planned. However, this strategy has had many limitations versus the proposed Targeted Prevention strategy. The effectiveness of lockdown in mortality reduction may be temporary because the lives it saves in one wave may be lost in another subsequent wave if lockdown measures are not perpetuated. A single infectious wave causes such a serious damage to the economy that more lockdowns may not be economically viable for most countries. The lockdown approach does not consider the scientific knowledge available about the virus and its target population. It causes panic, disrupts socio-economic activities, and forces quarantine of entire populations.If we target our preventive measures on minimizing the risk of the vulnerable population becoming infected and on proactively maximizing control of their comorbid conditions before they get infected, then the prevention may lead to less cases among the vulnerable and therefore potentially lower mortality rates.In the Catalonia example (controlling 23% of the population), the pandemic can be managed until vaccine is available for all. This study lays the foundation for a ""Targeted Prevention"" strategy and urges governments to come forward to test and validate them. With this strategy, governments are likely to achieve all three goals that they are fighting for: 1) minimize the viral transmission on the vulnerable and potentially reduce the mortality; 2) maximize the efficiency in use of resources because only 23% of the population is using the resources-this facilitates contact tracing, testing, and prevention of the infection; and 3) minimize the disruptions so most of the productive population can continue their role in the economy leading to a sustainable economy and social wellbeing.The author reports no conflicts of interest for this work.Risk Management and Healthcare Policy is an international, peerreviewed, open access journal focusing on all aspects of public health, policy, and preventative measures to promote good health and improve morbidity and mortality in the population.

25b59d21cefac3c4ce6ec1c9b6e5d0ab8995f0e2,Quantitative proteomic analysis of the tizoxanide effect in vero cells,"www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The broad-spectrum nature of NTZ/TIZ also suggests that its ability to inhibit different viruses could be a consequence of its action on the host-regulated processes rather than its direct effect on the virus processes themselves. It seems plausible then, that the effect of these molecules could not only be a result of the direct action of the drug upon the virus or its proteins but might also stem from its influence on the way that the cell responds to the virus.In December of 2019, China reported the outbreak of a new disease, caused by a new Coronavirus that was later named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was named COVID-19. On March 11, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then and to this date, SARS-CoV-2 has over 3.7 million confirmed cases and has killed over 260 thousand people. Although there are speculations about a vaccine on a fast track, most specialists are not very optimistic about a quick vaccine solution for COVID- 19. In vitro studies with nitazoxanide and tizoxanide were performed with canine coronavirus strain S-378, with a murine strain of coronavirus (MHV-A59) and a bovine coronavirus strain (BCoV-L9) with promising antiviral activity 24, 25 . NTZ and TIZ had also its antiviral activity tested in vitro against the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) showing also effectivity 26 . Furthermore, Nitazoxanide was tested in China against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 agent) using Vero E-6 cells and showed high antiviral activity 27 .As the clinical trial results utilizing Nitazoxanide against SARS-Cov-2 infections start to build up, the more we know about the mode of action of this molecule, the better we can approach and rationalize about its use not only for COVId-19 but also for the other viruses being studied with this molecule.In this work, we aimed to examine the response of Vero cells to TIZ treatment and unveil possible mechanisms for its antimicrobial effect. To this end, a label-free proteomic approach using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) was used as strategy. We performed a comparative proteomic analysis between untreated-or TIZ-treated Vero cells, highlighting differential abundance of proteins involved in cell processes. TIZ-treated Vero cells caused a decrease in several protein abundance levels related to different biological processes. It is our understanding that the way TIZ influences a broad range of cells and pathogens can bring new insights in the development of molecules with broad anti-pathogen action.cell viability assay and teM. In order to evaluate the toxicity of TIZ in Vero cells, neutral red dye-uptake method was performed. The cytotoxicity assay showed no interference of the DMSO at the concentrations used in the samples in Vero cells and the TIZ influenced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner as shown in Fig. 2 . The calculated CC 50% of TIZ was 1.77 μg/mL. A non-toxic concentration of TIZ, 0.5 μg/mL, was selected as a concentration for downstream experiments. TEM of ultrathin sections of Vero cells were also performed in an attempt to observe morphological changes or other phenomena such as inclusion bodies, alterations in cell membrane, or increases in the number of cytoplasmic vesicles the TIZ treatment could cause in comparison to untreated cells. However, no significant disturbances were observed (Fig. 3) . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 1D electrophoresis. To visualize the changes in protein profile of Vero cell in response to TIZ treatment, total protein of confluent Vero cells untreated and TIZ-treated were extracted, dosed and loaded for SDS-PAGE. Fluorescent and Coomassie blue staining showed that the proteins were successfully extracted (Fig. 4) . As indicated in Fig. 4 , it is possible to observe several bands in the SDS-PAGE gel becoming highly intense or almost disappearing with TIZ treatment compared to the untreated control. These differences in band intensity slightly changed the protein profile of Vero cells mainly above 28 kDa and were similar in all replicates.Protein identification and functional protein identification and functional categorization. In order to concentrate the sample and quantify the differences in overall protein abundance levels in untreatedand TIZ-treated Vero cells, FASP digestion using a 30 kDa cut-off filter was performed. A total of 1,303 proteins were identified (Supplementary Table 1 ). Gene Ontology analysis identified 133 functional subcategories of proteins (www.agbas e.mssta te.edu), and three primary categories: cellular component (28) , molecular function (39) , and biological process (66) (Fig. 5) . The greatest differences were observed in the biological process subcategory: ribonucleoprotein complex assembly, nucleocytoplasmic transport, tRNa metabolic, circulatory system, cofactor metabolic and cellular amino acid metabolic process. They presented more than a 100% increase in the number of proteins in treated cells compared to the untreated cells. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ For cellular component, TIZ-treated cells had an increase in the number of proteins associated with cilium, nuclear chromosome and cytoplasmic membrane-bounded vesicle while ribosome proteins were decreased. In the molecular function category, more proteins were associated with methyltransferase activity, ubiquitin-like protein binding and GTPase activity and fewer proteins associated with structural constituent ribosome, transferase activity, transferring glycosyl groups, lipid binding and ATPase activity in TIZ-treated cells. teins in both samples, using the parameters described in the Methods section. According to the statistical analysis, FASP method was able to identify 15 differentially expressed proteins at the p < 0.05 level, 12 of them with higher abundance in mock-treated samples and 3 in TIZ-treated samples, involved in different biological process such as translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis, intracellular trafficking, secretion and vesicular transport, signal transduction, chromatin structure and dynamics, RNA processing and modification and cytoskeleton (Table 1 ).NTZ is a safe clinical approved antiparasitic agent indicated for the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal infections and, along with its active form, TIZ, has been shown to inhibit a broad range of viruses and microorganisms. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, clinical studies with Nitazoxanide and its efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infections (COVID-19) are currently underway. In this context, more information on how the host cell responds to TIZ would be interesting to unravel other intracellular mechanisms responsible for its antiviral and antimicrobial activity. In 2015, MS-based proteomic approaches were used as a new and promising tool to help understanding cellular changes in metabolism due to a treatment exposure 28 . In this study, a label free MS-based proteomic approach was used to identify proteins whose abundance is altered by TIZ treatment and to show possible cell processes disturbed or enhanced by it. A filter-aid sample preparation (FASP) method was adopted for protein digestion strategy. Cell viability assay was performed to assess the Vero cells response to TIZ treatment and to help us set our treatment protocol while TEM was performed for visualization of cell morphology and 1D electrophoresis for visualizations of proteome profile. It has been reported that the group of proteins with altered abundance in proteomic studies of virus-infected cells or cells exposed to some level of stress, such as drug action, is small. Besides, the changes can be subtle and, sometimes, with fold change less than 2 29 . Even using different approaches as isotopic labelling or Differential Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE), the number of detected proteins with altered abundance does not increase dramatically 30, 31 . When we considered a p value < 0.05, as demonstrated in Table 1 , the FASP label-free LC/MS/ MS methodology was able to identify 15 cellular proteins with different abundance levels when treated with TIZ (3 had increased levels and 12 had decreased levels). This indicates a subtle effect of TIZ on the cell.Among the decreased proteins in metabolism, we highlight fatty acid synthase (FASN), a protein responsible to synthesize palmitate from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA in a reaction that requires NADPH. Palmitate, the core of fatty acid production, can be further metabolized into a variety of long chain fatty acids that will be used in lipid production for membrane biosynthesis and lipid droplet formation 32 . Importantly, many viruses induce and require fatty acid synthesis at some stage of their replication cycle and the interference in this pathway could affect the virus production. The use of critical inhibitors of enzymes for fatty acid synthesis such as acetyl-CoA www.nature.com/scientificreports/ carboxylase and fatty acid synthase led to a significant decrease in the production of infectious cytomegalovirus, influenza A, hepatitis C and dengue viruses 33 . In the case of dengue virus, non-structural protein NS3 seems to be responsible for FASN recruitment, and lipidomics of mosquito infected cells showed that some sphingolipids and phospholipids were upregulated by dengue infection 34 . Therefore, FASN inhibition caused by TIZ treatment could explain the wide antiviral action of this substance. However, the specific mechanism by which inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis interferes with the replication of these viruses has not yet been determined. Studies suggest that possible changes in membrane composition required for viral replication, assembly or budding, decreases in envelope phospholipid synthesis or delays in the modification of fatty acids from proteins would be among the possible targets caused by inhibition of FASN in infected cells 33, 35 . Ras-related protein Rap-1a, a signal transduction-related protein, was detected in lower levels with the TIZ treatment. Signal transduction processes are, in many aspects, protein-driven events. Changes in protein level, activity, localization or interactions allow cells to react to a specific event and also to vary the sensitivity, duration and dynamics of the response 36 . Ras-related protein Rap-1a have been described to interact with several different pathways, namely MAPK, ERK, GRK2, (JAK)/STAT, and NF-kB [37] [38] [39] . In addition, they have been implicated in other biological events, including Intracellular trafficking, secretion and vesicular transport, Transcription, replication, recombination and repair, and defense mechanisms. Thus, more information is needed about these complex interactions at both the cellular and whole organism levels for a better understanding of the TIZ antimicrobial activity.The abundance levels of two proteins related to RNA processing and modification were also altered with the TIZ treatment. Newly synthesized RNA molecules undergo different modifications before their translation in the cytoplasm. These processing steps include specific modifications of RNA nucleotides at the ends of the primary transcript or at internal positions, and removal of internal extra RNA sequences 40 . Levels of spliceosome RNA helicase DDX39B and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (HNRNPH) were decreased with the treatment. These numbers are in accordance to the overall number of ribosome proteins, decreased with the treatment.HNRNPs are a large Family of RNA-binding proteins involved in alternative splicing, mRNA stabilization, and transcriptional and translational regulation [reviewed in Ref. 41 ], and they have been reported to interact with several virus proteins and RNA. Studies demonstrate that HNRNPH is upregulated with dengue infection in cell culture in addition to interacting with dengue non-structural protein 1, helping the virus to propagate in the cell 42 . HNRNPH also seems to be necessary to bind to specific retroviruses proteins to control the RNA splicing needed to HIV-1 and Rous sarcoma virus life cycle 43 . Therefore, decrease in the amount of HNRNPH account for part of the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of TIZ.In addition, three proteins with increased levels with the treatment stood out: dynactin subunit 2, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (EIF6) and cytoskeleton associated protein 4 (CKAP4).Dynactin subunit 2, one of the increased proteins in intracellular trafficking, secretion and vesicular transport, is part of the dynactin complex, acting as cofactor for the dynein, a minus-ended-directed microtubule associated motor responsible for retrograde transport in eukaryotic cells. The dynactin-dynein motor complex has been implicated in several important subcellular functions involving intracellular organelle transport 44 , including the transport of many viruses from cytosol to their site of replication 45 . Due to the great diversity of viruses and their replication mechanisms and requirements, each antiviral activity must be evaluated individually. On the other hand, Harrinson et al. 46 demonstrated that full maturation of phagosomes of the murine monocyte/ macrophage line depends on dynein-dynactin association to acquire its antimicrobial properties required for pathogen elimination.EIF6 is a protein from the translation initiation group that does not function as an initiation factor and is known to be important in ribosome biogenesis by regulating cellular levels of free 60S subunit 47 CKAP4 also known as cytoskeleton-linking membrane protein 63 (CLIMP-63) or p63, is a stable and abundant type II transmembrane protein 51 predominantly located in the RER and present in higher eukaryotes 52 . It has multiple functions including maintaining ER structure, ribosome anchoring in the RER, RER anchoring to the cytoskeleton via microtubule interaction, besides acting as a receptor for different ligands. In addition, Li et al. 53 demonstrated that expression of CKAP4 discouraged cell cycle progression and reduced the proliferation ability of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.The current results in this work confirm the safe clinical use of TIZ. It presented low toxicity and subtle changes in protein profile were observed. These changes do not seem to be responsible for triggering a specific protein for antimicrobial effect in general, but to act on the cell as a whole. Nevertheless, the decreased levels of FASN, HNRNPH and HNRNPK with the treatment appear to be in part responsible for the antiviral success against several viruses. The biosynthetic pathway of fatty acids has already been suggested as targets for development of therapeutics that inhibit the replication of DENV and other enveloped viruses 58 . However, most of the studies are focused on virus-cell interaction and there is still a lot to understand about how cellular metabolism changes influence on host response to viral infection at the organism level, from the production of hormones to immune responses.In this work, we report for the first time a differential proteomic analysis between Vero cell cultures mockand TIZ-treated by label-free LC/MS/MS analysis. This proteomics study provides valuable data for a better Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:14733 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71634-2 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ understanding of the roles played by host cell proteins during TIZ treatment. The broad antimicrobial range of TIZ points towards its overall effect in cell metabolism and RNA processing and modification. Nevertheless, further functional analysis is necessary. The list of proteins is likely to be further extended by improving the proteomic analysis, i.e. by increasing the number of replicates in the analysis, providing some level of protein fractionation, or performing a longer peptide separation coupled to a more sensitive and faster scanning mass spectrometer. Our data provides evidence that the knowledge of the functional expression of proteins may be of value for therapeutic purposes. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ concentrated onto a 2 cm × 100 µm i.d.

A top 5 method with higher-energy collisional activation (HCD) for product ion generation in the HCD cell was used with normalized collision energy setting of 27 V to induce precursor ion fragmentation (+ 1 charge states were excluded).Protein identification and analysis. Raw LC/MS/MS datafiles were processed using MaxQuant software 57 and database searched using the integrated Andromeda 58 search engine against the non-redundant database of the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) containing entries from Chlorocebus sabaeus as well as the two protein standards bovine serum albumin and rabbit glycogen phosphorylase (62,148 entries). Trypsin was defined as the digesting enzyme, along with a maximum of two missed tryptic sites, whereas fixed carbamidomethyl Cys modification and variable oxidized Met modification were permitted. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 was utilized. Otherwise, default MaxQuant and Andromeda parameters were used for processing and searching. For statistical analysis, the MaxQuant ProteinGroups report was imported into Perseus (www.perse us-frame work.org), and protein label free quantification (LFQ) intensities based on extracted ion chromatograms were used to compare expression differences between sample groups. Data preprocessing prior to analysis of variance (ANOVA) included the following steps: Log(2) transformation of protein intensities and replacing missing data with a value approximating the lower limit of detection. Only proteins that were observed in three out of three replicates for at least one treatment group were retained and subjected to ANOVA. Statistically significant proteins were retained at the p < 0.1 significance level.The identified and validated proteins from protein digestion were classified according to gene ontology (GO) terms in cell component, biological process and molecular function by AgBase software (www.agbas e.mssta te.edu). The uncharacterized proteins were classified according to GO terms and protein function from Homo sapiens proteins searched at Universal Protein Resource (Uniprot) catalog (www.unipr ot.org) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (www.genom e.jp). To reduce the large number of GO terms, the biological process was divided into 15 terms: Cell cycle control and cell division, chromatin structure and dynamics, cytoskeleton, defense mechanisms, energy production and conversion, Inorganic ion transport and metabolism, intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport, membrane organization, metabolism (including carbohydrate, amino acids and lipids transport and metabolism), post-translational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones, RNA processing and modification, secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism, signal transduction, transcription, replication, recombination and repair, translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis, and other function.All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article and the Supplementary  Table and deposited ",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-07,9
699001d2f293a51f5ae49ab4ba9a9ffc0e72496b,Journal Pre-proof The recovery of global stock markets indices after impacts due to pandemics The recovery of global stock markets indices after impacts due to pandemics,"Pandemics such as the current COVID-19 are large-scale outbreaks of infectious diseases that can greatly increase the mortality over a wide geographic area and cause significant economic, social, and political disruption [1, 2] .Based on evidences, experts suggest that the likelihood of pandemics occurrence has increased significantly [3, 4] . Issues such as global travel and integration, urbanization, land use, and intensive exploitation of the natural resources contribute significantly to stimulate this problem [3] .An epidemic can be defined as the occurrence, in a community or region, tors and the stock market volatility across five major world economies were studied [40] .In the follow-up the data and methods adopted in this work, such as the cointegration analysis [9, 10] and the VECM methodology [12] are discussed.We consider the TS describing the 4 disease outbreaks and 11 key stock exchange indices. The data are avaiable at the World Health Organization (WHO) website (https://www.who.int/) and at the Investing website (https://www.investing.com/).We analyze the evolution of the number of cases of the 4 pandemics during first 79 days of available data versus the evolution of the financial indices during the same period. The work aims to measure the impact of the outbreaks against the indices. Figure 1 shows the market data and the total number of cases for each of the disease outbreaks sets. In order to normalize the curves, the z-score standardization is adopted [41] .The stationarity of the TS are evaluated by means of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test [42] . The presence of unit roots in a TS is detected by not rejecting the null hypothesis of the aforesaid test.The trend, drift and constant are types of regression models that can properly identify the integration order (d) of a TS, that is, the number of times necessary to differentiate a TS that was originally non-stationary to become a stationary one. This is a necessary property to identify a cointegration relation between two TS [10] .The cointegration process [43] is analyzed by means of the Johansen test [9] and they are explained in the sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. Whenever a cointegration relation is observed between the TS, the VECM equation [44, 45] is estimated and the OIR and FEVD are analyzed.We also calculate the historical market volatility σ for the 11 stock indices as the square root of the sum of squared returns over the past 79 trading days [46] . The cointegration relation between two TS was firstly introduced by Granger [43] . Later, Engle and Granger [47] explored the cointegration and the error correction mainly for estimation and testing. A simple interpretation of a cointegration relation and the process of adjustment known as the error correction model was proposed by Murray [48] . Smith et al. [49] proposed an extension of the concepts by exploring the multiple cointegration with 3 or more cointegrated variables. Hereafter, in the scope of investigating the transmission process among the pandemics and stock exchanges, the cointegration hypothesis is considered.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Often, we observe some misinterpretation between the terms ""cointegration"" and ""correlation"". Alexander [50] pointed that a cointegration process takes into account both the concepts of integration and stationarity, while that is not considered in a correlation measure. Additionally, the correlation calculates a linear association between two TS. The cointegration of two or more TS can be studied, while a correlation is simply a coefficient in the range [−1, 1]. However, a cointegration process cannot be ""quantified"", and, instead, it is ""identified"".The equilibrium error term for a TS x t was defined by Engle and Granger [47] aswhere t stands for the discrete-time sampling instants and z t is in the perfect equilibrium state that occurs when α = 0. In addition, x t is said to be a stationary TS if its integration order d is equal to 0. For d > 0 each step represents the quantity needed to differentiate the TS in order to make it stationary [48] . When a cointegration relation is revealed between two different TS such as, between x t and y t , both of them must be integrated at the same order. Thus, if x t ∼ I(d), then a + bx t ∼ I(d) is also true, where a and b are real constants and b = 0. Therefore, the error term can be rewritten as a linear combination as followsThis means that when d = b = 1, if both TS are integrated at I(1), then the z t is said to be cointegrated of order zero I(0), and the adjustment occurs for each step. However, it is possible the occurrence of some special cases, namely, z t ∼ I(d−b), 0 < b < 1, that would lead to a fractional differentiation process [51] . In other words, this relation can also be expressed by defining the following error correction parameters f and g aswhere x t and y t denote the cointegrated variables, u t and w t represent stationary white noise and e 1t−1 = y t−1 − x t−1 and e 2t−1 = x t−1 − y t−1 are the cointegration relations between the variables x t and y t , respectively.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fIn this work, we evaluate the cointegration process among the 4 pandemics, with respect to the 11 stock exchanges indices. The cointegration is calculated by means of the Johansen test, and the VECM is estimated when the cointegration between a particular disease with respect to the particular stock index is verified.The VECM is based on the generalized vector autoregression (VAR), that allows the adjustment of a regression model between multiple variables to evaluate their relationship [44, 45] .Let us consider p 1t and p 2t as two non-cointegrated and non-stationary TS. The relation between these TS can be described using the VAR model of order j ∈ N for both variables as [52] where γ and θ are the equation autoregressive terms of p 1t and p 2t , respectively, ε 1t and ε 2t denote white-noise disturbances and i the equation lag order i = 1, ..., j. However, if the TS are not initialy stationary, then the log returns (∆) in p 1t and p 2t can be applied in order to become stationary equations as [53, 52] :Thus, the VAR(j) model is applied to the differences givingIf the two TS can exhibit a cointegrated relation between each other, then the Error Correction Term (ECT) represented by α i (β 0 + β 1 p 1t−1 + 7 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f β 2 p 2t−1 ) can be implemented and the VAR model becomes a VECM as follows [54, 55, 56, 57] where β and α are matrices whose dimensions are n × r, representing the TS and the cointegrated vectors, respectively. The β parameters are related to the long-run equilibrium among the TS. The parameters α reflect how fast the series tend to return the equilibrium after some perturbation by defining the steps to come back to equilibrium s, such as s = 1/α. Moreover, from the ECT term one can extract the following relation β 0 + β 1 p 1t−1 + β 2 p 2t−1 = 0 that represents the equilibrium equation between p 1t and p 2t .Statistical analysis, estimation, hypothesis testing and inference of cointegration vectors related to the β and α terms can be found in [58, 59, 60] . The Johansen test verifies if the rank r of the matrix α β is equal to zero (null hypothesis), that is, if r = rank(α β) = 0. If r = 0, then this implicate the non-existence of the error correction term (ECT). Otherwise, if r = 0, then the null hypothesis is rejected and there is a cointegration relation between the TS. Johansen proposed two possibilities, namely, the Max-Eigen and the Trace tests, that are based in the assumption of pure unit root denoted by [61, 59] LR trace (r 0 , r 0where LR denotes the likelihood ratio for testing the null hypothesis of r = r 0 , T stands for the sample size, λ is the eigenvector associated with the matrix and n is the maximum number of possible cointegrating vectors. In contrast to the method for cointegration validation proposed by Engle-8 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Granger [47] , the Johansen test allows the study of more than one cointegration relation among the variables. For this reason, we adopt the Johansen approach for analysing possible cointegration processes between the disease incidence versus the stock index. Whenever a cointegration is detected, the VECM is applied for the stock indices.This section presents the obtained results for the stationarity of the TS, using the ADF method [42] . The cointegration results achieved by means of the Johansen test based on the Max-Eigen and Trace criteria for 11 different financial indices against the 4 outbreaks are analyzed. Afterwards, the Hansen and Seo [62] threshold existence significance test is explored. This test is important to decide if VECM is an appropriate model to carry out the work. The correlation, the VECM, the response from an orthogonal impulse (OIR) and the FEVD are depicted. The historical volatility during the 4 outbreaks for the 11 stock exchange indices is also obtained.Tables 1 and 2 summarize the obtained results for trend, drift and constant models.One can note that all financial indices are integrated at order d = 1 with the COVID-19, EBOLA and MERS data and at order d = 2 with the SARS data. Tables 1 and 2 indicate also that the SARS data and the financial indices present cointegrations of orders I(2) and I(1), respectively. This means that the significant results produced by the Johansen test can indicate a spurious result. Table 3 shows the results of the Johansen cointegration test for the 11 financial indices against the 4 outbreaks. One can observe that the majority of the financial indices is strongly affected by the disease outbreaks. Moreover, we verify the cointegration of all stock exchange indices with the COVID-19, EBOLA and MERS. However, not all indices follow that trend in what concerns the SARS. Tables 4, 6, 8 and 10 summarize the obtained results for the threshold effects by testing the significance of their existence through linear cointegration versus threshold cointegration. Indeed, the threshold cointegration test listed in Table 10 confirms that a linear cointegration would not be appropriate for a few TS involving the SARS, namely S&P 500, Nikkei, HSI and Nifty. Nevertheless, among the 44 possibilities (11 financial indices versus 4 outbreaks) listed in Tables 4, 6 Drift None did not reject the null-hypothesis for linear cointegration. Therefore, they should not be handled by using the threshold approach [62] . Bearing this fact in mind and knowing that the OIR and the FEVD are VECM-based tools, we decided to maintain the cointegration relations between the financial indices and the outbreaks that showed a linear cointegration by means of the Johansen test.In this context, we consider the VECM model as appropriate for describing the relationship between the outbreaks and the financial indices. Their results are analyzed for all pairs that presented a cointegration process by means of the Johansen criteria.Tables 5, 7, 9 and 11, list the correlation and the VECM parameters for the indices that revealed cointegration against the COVID-19, EBOLA, MERS and SARS data, respectively. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fWe now explore the OIR and apply the FEVD to measure the variance of the forecast error regarding the shocks of the outbreaks data. In order to normalize the OIR results, the z-score standardization is also performed. Figures 2a, 2c, 3a and 3c represent the OIR over time. On the other hand, the figures 2b, 2d, 3b and 3d depict the FEVD analysis for the 11 stock exchange indices also against the COVID-19, EBOLA, MERS and SARS data. Steps (a) The OIR: financial indices against COVID-19. by the EBOLA outbreak. However, it tends to bounce back to equilibrium in the following steps. Figure J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Figure 3a shows that, in general, all indices tended to be negatively influenced by the MERS outbreak. This effect is confirmed by the FEVD in figure 3b . Moreover, the HSI and Ibov are the most influenced in terms of the variance of their residuals. In turn, the shocks caused by the SARS provoked a strong initial negative response in the Nifty and Nikkei and a retarded negative shock in the CAC and EuroStoxx, as shown in figure 3c. However, when observing the FEVD in Figure 3d one can note that the SARS affects mostly the Ibov, Nikkei, Nifty and HSI. This pattern would be expected in the Asian stocks, but the same would not be expected in the Ibov since the OIR showed a positive response. Probably, this result can be related to a false positive. Table 9 : The Correlation and the VECM parameters for the cointegrated indices against the MERS. Confidence levels: 90%(*), 95%(**) and 99% (***).J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Tables 5, 7, 9 and 11, show a significant number of lags for the VECM equations in all outbreaks, with exception for the MERS. We verify a 8-lags equation for all the stock exchange indices against the COVID-19 data which confirms a large influence of the outbreak with respect to the residuals of the steps. Also, when using the equilibrium relation s = 1/α it is shown that for all equations a huge number of steps is necessary to reach equilibrium back from the COVID-19. When looking to the indices relation with the EBOLA outbreak it is seen a high lagged VECM only for North American indices. However, all the indices shows high disequilibrium reflected by the parameter α. The results for the indices against the MERS were expected since the disease lead a moderate number of cases if compared to the other outbreaks, which is also confirmed by the higher of α values. Despite the SARS outbreak being mostly spread over Asian countries, the HSI presented a 3-lags equation rather than the 8-lags of the other indices.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f In synthesis, with exception of the SARS, all stock indices are cointegrated with the COVID-19, EBOLA and MERS. This feature is not evinced by the SARS since some indices related mainly to the North America and Europe revealed a weak or even null cointegration. Figure 4 shows the historical market volatilities σ for the 11 stock indices during the period of the diseases episodes. In the map, we mark the historical volatility as the square root of the sum of squared returns over the past 79 trading days. With the exception of the Nikkey and HSI indices, all other indices experienced higher historical volatility during the analyzed period for the COVID-19, suggesting an unprecedented stock market impact caused for it and a greater difficulty to bounce back the financial indices. Moreover, one can note that among all indices explored in this work, the Ibov index was the most susceptible and strongly affected by the shocks due to the diseases.We believe the results offer ground for some reflection about of heavy-25 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f handed restrictions on the economical activity in the scope of the efforts to contain pandemics. The healthcare rationale for travel restrictions, business closures, and social distancing mandates is clear, but it is also painfully evident that these policies bring great economic and financial negative consequences. Therefore, an important challenge is how to address health crisis created by pandemics (such as the COVID-19) and, simultaneously, to avoid strangle the economy. A pandemic can be followed by sustained periods -over years or decades -with affected investment opportunities, possibly due to heightened desires to save, that is, due to an increase in precautionary saving or to a rebuilding of depleted wealth.Several nations have adopted an aggressive counter-pandemic fiscal expansion that will boost the public debt further, reducing the national savings rate. In turn, this might put upward on the interest rate, even though that the expansion of public debt could be easier to sustain in the long-run. This movement can affect, among others, the subsequent low returns to assets, impacting (to some extent) the stock exchange indices worldwide.Regarding the current COVID-19 pandemic, the global economic trajectory seems very different than was expected only some months ago.This paper considered the Johansen cointegration test and the bivariate VECM analysis, exploited by the OIR and the FEVD, to investigate the bilateral relationship between the incidence of important 4 diseases outbreaks against 11 stock exchange indices. The historical volatilities of the same stock indices were also calculated. The results revealed that the shocks caused by hte diseases has a significant effect upon the stock indices. Most of the indices suffered initial strong shocks due the impulse in each disease outbreak. However, differently from the others diseases, an impulse in the COVID-19 maintained a significant volatility after the initial period, showing recovering difficulties of the financial indices due the shock caused by COVID-19. Additionally, the higher historical volatility occurred mainly during the period of the COVID-19. The results point to a higher impact over the Ibov-Brazil and reveal its poor recovering dynamics when compared to the others indices. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that, in general, there is a larger perception of risk by investors related to countries with larger economic and social fragility. 26 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",Brazil,first author,2020-09-28,9
2c6149056f1de7cb7204694facf70d27d9e7c8fa,Estimate of the actual number of COVID-19 cases from the analysis of deaths,"The number of confirmed cases of COVID is usually established in all countries through testing (usually RT-qPCR) which is done under passive (person using the health system) or active surveillance plans (search and tracing of cases through street or home operations).There are enormous differences between the various testing systems, which leads to very different figures of positivity: from more than 3000 tests/case confirmed (New Zealand) to 1.9 test/case confirmed (Mexico). Argentina is close to the lower limit, with only 2.4 tests/cc, which corresponds to a positivity in the order of 40%. [1] .These differences make virtually useless the comparisons of case numbers between countries, between districts within a country, or even between different times within the same district or country, as the number of confirmed cases is strongly influenced by the testing strategy. While with low positive rates and efficient tracking a high percentage of actual cases can be detected, in a test saturation situation the proportion of detected cases to real cases can be very low.For this reason it is convenient to use other methods for prevalence estimation, which do not imply the use of the number of confirmed cases, which is of little value. In countries in advanced stages of the epidemic it is useful to use the number of deaths.However, there are strong reasons to expect that the prevalence will be higher in some particular age groups. Therefore, these estimates may be closer to reality if we take into account the true age pyramid of deaths, which will have in its composition not only the population age pyramid and the IFR of each range, but also the proportion in which, due to behavioral differences, each age range is susceptible to infection. This preliminary work addresses the case of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA) as an example for the determination of infections by the IFR method of cases of death.Thus, each death registered in the Argentinean Integrated Health Information System will have a previous number of cases 1/IFR. Although this number of estimated actual infections can be entered in a single day, in that case the temporary values obtained will be noisy, especially for the age ranges of lower IFR. To eliminate these problems, an infection-to-death function obtained from the experimental data was used. Figure 3 shows the histogram from the recorded date of symptom onset to the date of death. The data were fitted with the following empirical expression: Once this statistical dependency is established, each death will be counted as 1/IFR number of cases distributed in the previous 44 days according to the previous curve.The local maxima observed in mid-May and June correspond to events of death of young people with very low IFR. If restricted to those over 30 years of age, the dependency takes on the appearance of Figure 5 . The decrease observed at dates at the end of the graph, close to that of the used dataset is again the result of data censoring. Many cases of infection that will end in death are not yet counted, and a proportion of cases that have already died have not been loaded into the system. To solve this problem, a normalizing function was built by using the data recorded on 1/8/2020 and comparing it with the data from 11/9/2020, the date on which all the July data are supposed to be stable. This function is defined by the following empirical expressionEquation (3) in which t is the temporal distance in days between the last date of the dataset and the date of estimated cases of infection, A = 53.84 and B=1.29, values obtained by fitting the old data to the new one using the transformation D old •Y = D new The result of applying this transformation is shown in Figure  6 .The use of ""confirmed cases"" as a widespread metric throughout the world, especially in the media and social networks has many implications not usually considered. One of them is the factual impossibility of comparing situations in 2 different regions, countries, districts, and even within the same area at two different times. This is because the relationship between ""confirmed cases"" and actual cases of SARS-COV-2 infection is extremely uncertain, and depends heavily on the testing policy and strategy and the capacity of the system to manage large numbers of infections in a timely manner. Only a tiny minority of countries have achieved a testing system that roughly reflects the actual number of infections, which is particularly difficult since many of them are asymptomatic, with estimates varied from 15% to 80% of those infected. [6, 7] The terminology frequently used in the media, calling confirmed cases ""contagions"", suggests that this number of reported cases actually corresponds to those infected. However, it is common to find whole countries where the number of confirmed cases can be estimated to be 20-30 times lower than the actual number (e.g., Belgium) or cities where the ratio was 50 to 1 (London). This effect is exacerbated when in a situation of mass transmission and system saturation.The Mandatory Social Preventive Isolation (ASPO, from its initials in Spanish) was nationwide in Argentine at March 20th, and was effectively complied with in all districts for approximately 2 to 3 weeks. From that moment on, different districts carried out different policies in the management of the pandemic.In particular, the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires had an openness policy from the beginning, taking to the extreme the original idea of ""flattening the curve"" of infections (aka mitigation, as contrary to suppression) so that the population would be infected at a low rate in order to prevent the collapse of the health system, but not adopting active policies that would try to eliminate or reduce the number of daily infections. Additionally, the policy of control and sanitary isolation of those who arrived in Argentina in repatriation flights from countries with very high viral circulation was not very effective. They were isolated in hotels, with subsequent swabbing and return home in case of negative results. The high rate of false negatives in PCR during the first days after infection [8] , and the possible subsequent failure to comply with the mandatory isolation in homes, may have produced a continuous influx of infected during the months of March to June, which may explain the inability to reduce cases to very low levels as happened in the rest of the Argentine provinces.After 4 months of rising daily confirmed cases, the dynamics of cases in CABA began a series of rises, stabilizations and gentle declines that remained around the 1000 confirmed cases per day on average. This trend is shown in Figure 8 . However, the positivity of the tests in the order of 40 to 50% on most days indicates that the actual number of cases per day should be much higher than those reported. For this purpose, the number of deaths through the IFR can be used, obtaining the dynamics shown in Figure 6 and following.If this is indeed the case, this situation poses an imminent danger. By lowering the number of daily cases due to the reduction of the susceptible population through infection in conjunction with reduced mobility and social connectivity through current health regulations, the recovery of confidence and ""back to normality"" of the elderly in an environment of high viral circulation could lead to a significant increase in the death rate without a large prior increase in the number of cases, given the high IFR in adults over 60.However, the case growth curves shown in Figure 7 suggest that an overall prevalence of 40%, with peaks of 60% in the most mobile sector of society may be the result of an underestimation of the IFR. Assuming that individuals are immune to reinfection (at least in short time), for the values of the expected and estimated R reproduction number in conditions of social distancing, and confirmed by the low slope of the infection curve, a cumulative prevalence of 40% should be accompanied by a clear lowering of cases, beyond the sanitary measures provided, which is not observed, although it is glimpsed in the last week analyzed.A possible source of error is the undercounting of deaths in Spain, which is known given the figures of excess death over previous years. While the confirmed COVID deaths as of June 21 are 22,000, the excess deaths for that date total 48,000. Some of these deaths may be due to the collapse of the health system, but many others probably correspond to unrecorded cases of COVID-19. This could raise the IFR values to twice their reported value. If this were the case, the cumulative prevalence values in CABA could be around 20%. The only prevalence study made public in CABA was conducted between May 15 and July 18, and indicated about 9% for the estimated dates [10]. However, this low prevalence would indicate that the IFR values in Argentina would be much higher than the values reported in Europe. On the other hand, the unreported deaths in Spain are considered to have occurred primarily among older people, many of whom lived in nursing homes. This would imply that only the IFRs in these ranges would be higher, further lowering the calculated prevalence.Another possible cause of error due to excess prevalence could be the socioeconomic conditions of CABA, which on average could be worse than the Spanish average weighted by the regions where there were more infections. This situation could be aggravated by factors related to the health system. However, although this could be the reality in other regions of Argentina, the City of Buenos Aires has a GDP/capita of values close to those of Europe, although much more unevenly distributed. This situation could distort the age distribution of the IFR.Of these possible causes of error, the underestimation of the IFRs in Spain due to the undercounting of deaths by COVID is more plausible. More recent estimates of IFR values [3] using the figures for excess deaths during the initial period of the pandemic in Spain tend to confirm this possibility. Although these new values are erratic in the lower age ranges, due to a significant amount of excess deaths which do not necessarily have to be attributed to COVID-19, a log-linear extrapolation to these low ranges allows estimating these IFR values. On the other hand, this new work does not differentiate between the 80-89 and 90+ age ranges, an aspect that is particularly important due to the large difference in IFR observed between the 80-89 and 90+ age groups. Figure 10 shows the IFR values corresponding to both estimates.",Argentina,abstract,2020-09-23,9

(2) In Brazil, over 1,800,000 cases and 72,000 deaths have been identified so far.Brazilian surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 cases began at the end of January, 2020. Ministry of Health (MoH) has defined the criteria for testing the suspected cases, which have been constantly updated. (3) Initially, suspected cases were determined as symptomatic individuals, presenting with fever and other signs of respiratory infection, independent of severity, who had recently travelled to countries with SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. In the end of February, the first SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were detected in the country, in individuals who had a history of returning from affected countries. However, since March 20th, widespread national community transmission of COVID-19 has been recognised in Brazil. Sustained transmission was initially observed in the big metropolis, as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. COVID-19 suspected samples were initially tested based on the network of laboratories established as part of the Influenza Surveillance System, which were already implemented in all Brazilian States. As the number of potential cases dramatically increased, additional laboratories were included as testing facilities. The Laboratory of Respiratory Viruses and Measles, at Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, is a National Influenza Centre for the Brazilian MoH and has been recently designated as one of the CO-VID-19 Reference Laboratories of the World Health Organization. Thus, we routinely receive samples from nine out of 27 Brazilian states (including Southern, Northeastern and Southern regions). Exceptionally, during this initial phase of the investigation, we also received samples from five additional states (from Midwestern, Northeastern and Northern regions), including from individuals who were quarantined upon their return from countries with SARS-CoV-2 communitarian transmission.Over the course of this investigation, that was conducted from late February until late March, therefore the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil, from the identification of the first cases and the statement of the communitarian transmission in the country, we have analysed 707 samples from COVID-19 suspected cases submitted to the influenza surveillance network. Respiratory specimens (mostly nasopharyngeal swabs) were subjected to total RNA extraction, by using commercial kits (QIAmp Viral RNA Mini kit -Qiagen, Germany), followed by SARS-CoV-2 detection by a TaqMan real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocol targeting amplification of the Envelope and Polymerase genes, which had been previously described. (4) The initial assays were performed with sets of primers and probes provided by Pan American Health Organization. (5) Later on, viral detection was performed using a kit (based on the same targets) pro-duced and validated by Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz, Brazil, (6) which also included as the internal control human RNP. This protocol was further registered by the Brazilian regulatory agency ANVISA as registration number 25351.225181/2020-88. Further, all the SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were submitted to differential diagnosis, by using the XGEN multiplex platform to detect additional 21 respiratory pathogens (Mobius Life Science, Brazil). Moreover, 165 SARS-CoV-2 negative cases were tested for this multiplex platform in order to detect the etiological agent of the respiratory infection. Testing only a subset of the SARS-CoV-2 negative cases was limited due to the high cost of this assay.As a result, during the period of our analysis, we have identified 29 (4.1%) SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. 58.6% of cases were male and the median age of the patients was 47 years old (ranging from 27 to 81). In relation to their symptoms, they presented with fever (measured or reported) (69.2%), cough (69.2%), sore throat (38.5%) and dyspnea (15.4%). Noteworthy, 22.2% of these individuals had preexisting chronic diseases and 54.5% were admitted to the hospital (Table I) . Importantly, most of the cases, in the course of this analysis, were from individuals with recent travel abroad history. Noteworthy, roughly half of the total positive cases were collected from individuals from the Southeast region, which was the initial Brazilian COVID-19 epicentre, (7) followed by the Midwest region, that comprised positive cases from Brasília from individuals that returned from an international trip. In our analysis, two (6.9%) of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals also were positive for the detection of rhinovirus.Furthermore, in the 165 (23.3%) SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals screened for additional pathogens, at least one etiological agent was detected in 109 (66.1%) of the cases (Table II) . Rhinovirus was the most prevalent pathogen, detected in 46 (27.9%) of the cases, followed by 18 (10.9%) cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 12 (7.3%) cases of enterovirus. In these 165 SARS-CoV-2 negative cases, 41 (24.8%) presented with co-detection of more than one pathogen. Of note, two cases resulted in a fatality. One of them, a 60-year-old male, who presented with pneumopathy, cardiopathy, diabetes and was HIV-positive, had a rhinovirus infection. The other one, a 50-year-old female with no comorbidities reported, was positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.These results represent a description of the surveillance being conducted in a South American country for the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 cases. So far, most of the confirmed cases, in Brazil, have been mild cases. In this study, fever and cough were the most common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 patients, which is consistent with a meta-analysis which included data from 50,466 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. (8) As in other countries, the number of cases is rising exponentially, and the availability of the diagnostic kits is a major limitation. Therefore, the MoH has recommended social isolation for all asymptomatic individuals that are non-key workers and the mild symptomatic cases of influenza like illness (ILI), regardless of the causative agent. Testing is currently mostly performed in the cases that present with symptoms, such as difficulty of breathing and high fever to support clinical management. Thus, although the identification of severe cases has already increased in the following weeks/ months, the true total number of cases probably is dramatically underestimated.It is important to highlight that, in Brazil, this study was conducted at the beginning of the influenza season, when other respiratory virus infections are also more prevalent. (9) This represents a great challenge for COV-ID-19 surveillance. Further analysis over the following months will show how the emergence and co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 will impact with the concomitant circulation of other seasonal respiratory viruses. Phylogeographical and phylogenetic studies are being conducted by others and us and will better elucidate the pattern of evolution and the chains of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the country.During the period of our study, which occurred in the initial month of the early epidemic phase in Brazil, Southeast accounted for most of the Brazilian COV-ID-19 cases, mainly from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states. (7) Since we do not receive samples from São Paulo due to the organisation of our surveillance system, most of our Southeastern cases were from Rio de Janeiro, the second most important COVID-19 epicenter in Brazil at that period. (7) Midwest region was the second most prevalent in our cohort, due to the inclusion of positive cases that returned from an international trip. Northeastern and Southern cases were still low, which also represented the COVID-19 scenario at that moment. Finally, as we do not receive samples from the North region systematically, also because of the organisation of the surveillance network, they were underrepresented in our cohort. Additionally, co-detection of an additional pathogen in the SARS-CoV-2 cases has already been described in a similar frequency to previous reports, in distinct populations. (10, 11, 12) Our results described that 6.9% of the SARS-CoV-2 samples also have detection of an additional pathogen (rhinovirus). Consistently, rhinovirus was also the most prevalent pathogen detected in our SARS-CoV-2 negative cases. Additional comprehensive analysis will determine the importance of the co-detection for the clinical presentation and evolution of cases, as well as for the future construction of the test algorithms.Our report emphasises the importance of differential diagnosis in suspected cases of COVID-19, because many of its symptoms are similar to those found in other common respiratory viral infection. The identification of the specific pathogen infecting the individual is important for public health and may contribute to treat-ment, when there is an available therapy, as in the case of influenza. Furthermore, the differentiation of the pathogens presenting with a similar respiratory syndrome has the potential to limit unnecessary quarantine/isolation, especially for key workers, although it is very difficult and expensive to implement for the entire population. This may be important, if we consider the burden that mass quarantine imposes on essential services, such as health, safety and food production, due to withdraw of workers from their activities.

Criterios y fundamentos para la organización del trabajo,"For this purpose, documents from the CNEA, IAEA, WHO and other scientific publications were consulted as reference. These recommendations are under constant review and are permanently updated.Within this framework, the present model of work organization for this essential activity is proposed, including general and specific recommendations and its epidemiological and immunological basis.Actualmente nos toca atravesar una pandemia, por lo cual todas las actividades se modifican a fin de transitarla de la manera más segura posible. La Radiofarmacia Hospitalaria no está exceptuada y debe tener un adecuado plan de trabajo, cuya propuesta constituye el motivo del presente artículo.La práctica segura de los procedimientos diagnósticos y terapéuticos realizados en el ámbito de la Medicina Nuclear requiere del permanente suministro de radiofármacos de alta calidad preparados de acuerdo a las Buenas Prácticas Radiofarmaceuticas 1 . Este es el objetivo de la Radiofarmacia Hospitalaria.El responsable de la Radiofarmacia Hospitalaria debe ser un profesional calificado, que garantice el producto final y la aplicación de un sistema de calidad que asegure todos los aspectos de las Buenas Prácticas Radiofarmacéuticas. Se debe poner énfasis en la necesidad de actuar con previsión y desarrollar una cultura de evaluación y supervisión constantes 2,3,4 .El conjunto de capacidades y competencias, tecnológicas u organizacionales, puestas a disposición del servicio de Medicina Nuclear mediante la Radiofarmacia Hospitalaria permite adoptar medidas que conduzcan a la mejora del servicio prestado, siendo un valor agregado frente a situaciones críticas como una pandemia.En el escenario actual es posible que pacientes COVID-19 positivos o sospechosos requieran prácticas de Medicina Nuclear para lo cual se tomarán todas las medidas sanitarias adecuadas, con la finalidad de proteger al personal de salud que realice la práctica, asegurando así la continuidad de la prestación del servicio 5 .Los documentos consultados, tanto institucionales CNEA 6 ,como internacionales, el OIEA 7,8 , la OMS 9 y otras publicaciones científicas 5, 10, 11, 12 , fundamentan el protocolo de seguridad diseñado.A fin de cumplir con los objetivos específicos de la Radiofarmacia Hospitalaria se enumeran las recomendaciones generales inherentes al Centro de Medicina Nuclear (CMN) de la CNEA, dada la vinculación de las dos áreas:• Reforzar medidas de higiene general.• Respetar las normas de higiene de ingreso del personal y pacientes para evitar la circulación viral del exterior al interior del CMN.• Capacitar al personal proporcionándole la instrucción indicada para la situación de pandemia y definir controles de cumplimiento que aseguren el funcionamiento de Radiofarmacia según el presente protocolo.Según la OMS, durante la pandemia se deben considerar los siguientes puntos a fin de asegurar la salud del personal, de los pacientes y de las personas vinculadas, familiares, etc. Utilizando estas consideraciones, se proponen las siguientes estrategias de trabajo:Segregar al personal en equipos fijos con días distintos, reduciendo el personal a lo mínimo indispensable y fomentando la comunicación y el trabajo interdisciplinario.Cada grupo tendrá un responsable profesional con autonomía para la toma de decisiones, evitando así demoras en las actividades que podrían ocasionar mayor exposición del paciente y del personal.Hacer un consenso médico para establecer cuáles estudios son de urgencia y cuáles pueden ser reprogramados, a fin de no exponer al personal innecesariamente en el ambiente hospitalario. Por ejemplo, los radiofármacos para estudios tales como detección de ganglio centinela, localización de hemorragias digestivas o estudios cardiológicos de urgencia, se marcarán en el día.Fomentar la comunicación telefónica interna en el servicio, como por reuniones virtuales periódicas entre los profesionales de los distintos sectores. Es primordial la comunicación fluida del personal y de los responsables de cada área.Favorecer el distanciamiento social entre el personal de salud y los pacientes, y entre el mismo personal de salud, organizando una agenda de pacientes de manera que permitan al personal desempeñar sus tareas con calma y a conciencia, así como la realización de las correspondientes tareas de desinfección (de equipos, de sectores comunes, etc.).Proveer al trabajador de los insumos personales necesarios para asegurar su protección. De faltar algún elemento dar aviso inmediato al responsable del sector para que se arbitren los medios necesarios, a fin de que se repongan los mismos. No se permitirá desarrollar tareas sin los elementos necesarios de protección personal que la misma requiera.Cada trabajador deberá contar con su EPP. Deberá dejar asentado que el mismo le fue entregado cerrado, siendo responsable de su cuidado, uso correcto y posterior descarte 9,10 .Consideraciones especiales vinculadas al personal de Radiofarmacia Hospitalaria. Hasta el momento no existe profilaxis para combatir esta enfermedad, por lo tanto, debemos prevenir los contagios, buscando criterios útiles para evitar la diseminación del virus en nuestras tareas esenciales compartidas. Además de criterios para elegir las pruebas diagnósticas, pronósticas y detección del desarrollo de inmunidad protectora. Las acciones deben lograr minimizar el factor de contagio, y esto no sería posible sin medidas mitigantes.Se han publicado artículos referidos a los cuidados que debe tener el personal de salud y otros trabajadores esenciales, en los que se describen criterios útiles para la organización de los grupos de trabajo 5, 9, 10 .La actividad de la Radiofarmacia Hospitalaria debe posicionarse en la actual situación de pandemia, mediante un manejo simple y claro de conceptos bioquímicos e inmunológicos.Luego del descifrado del genoma viral en China, se utilizó la secuenciación del ARN que lo compone para diseñar distintas pruebas diagnósticas en todo el mundo. La prueba RT-PCR (reacción en cadena de la polimerasa con transcriptasa inversa) detecta la presencia del virus. La especificidad teórica de las pruebas RT-PCR es del 100% porque el diseño de la imprimación es específico de la secuencia del genoma del SARS-CoV-2.En cuanto a la respuesta inmunológica se debe recordar el mecanismo de reclutamiento de glóbulos blancos o linfocitos que son los productores de anticuerpos (Ac).Existen dos tipos de linfocitos: los B y los T. Los linfocitos B son responsables del sistema inmunitario mediado por anticuerpos, es decir, se diferencian en células plasmáticas que producen anticuerpos frente a los antígenos, que son proteínas constituyentes del virus. Los linfocitos T son responsables del sistema inmunitario mediado por células. Algunos se diferencian en linfocitos T citotóxicos (linfocitos T citolíticos) y linfocitos citolíticos naturales (NK, natural killer), que establecen contacto físico y destruyen las células extrañas o alteradas por el agente infeccioso. Ciertos linfocitos T son responsables de la iniciación y desarrollo (linfocitos T cooperadores [helper]) o de la supresión (linfocitos T reguladores [linfocitos Treg]) de la mayoría de las respuestas inmunitarias mediadas por anticuerpos o células. Esta regulación ocurre mediante la liberación de moléculas de señalización conocidas como citoquinas.La inmunidad mediada por anticuerpos se estudia mediante análisis serológicos, a través de ensayos ELISA (ensayo inmunológico desarrollado mediante enzimas y cuantificable por espectrofotometría), los que analizan la presencia y cuantifican inmunoglobulinas. La variedad de los antígenos del virus permite el diseño de distintos kits diagnósticos. El siguiente gráfico (Fig. 2) , muestra el perfil inmunológico teórico en una infección viralTras la infección se generan anticuerpos de tipo IgM (que son detectables a partir de los 7 días post infección), y luego anticuerpos de tipo IgG (detectables a partir de los 14 días post infección) 13 .El gráfico que se muestra a continuación, Figura 3, ilustra la cinética de la respuesta inmunológica de una persona infectada y su vinculación con la valoración de riesgo de contagio y propagación del virus.La carga viral generalmente alcanza su punto máximo temprano en la enfermedad, y luego disminuye a medida que se desarrollan anticuerpos, y los títulos de anticuerpos aumentan en las siguientes 2 a 3 semanas.La utilidad de este criterio, es que, una persona inmunocompetente desarrolla este perfil inmunológico en caso de contagio, por lo cual es importante esta consideración en la organización de los grupos de trabajo.El diagnóstico serológico es especialmente importante para los pacientes asintomáticos, o con enfermedad leve a moderada. Se está convirtiendo en una herramienta importante para entender el alcance del COVID-19 en la comunidad, e identificar a las personas que son inmunes y potencialmente ""protegidas"" de infectarse.El marcador serológico más sensible y seguro es la determinación de anticuerpos IgM e IgG. Los niveles más altos se producen en la segunda y tercera semana de enfermedad, aunque se ha encontrado que IgM e IgG por ELISA son positivos incluso al cuarto día después del inicio de los síntomas 11 .Este método tiene una especificidad superior al 95% para el diagnóstico de COVID-19, que emparejado con la PCR inicial y su repetición, dos semanas más tarde, pueden aumentar aún más la precisión del diagnóstico. Se desconoce la persistencia a largo plazo y la duración de la protección conferida por los anticuerpos neutralizantes 12 .La rápida extensión del contagio por SARS-CoV-2 ha mostrado que es importante poder tener pruebas diagnósticas específicas que puedan identificar a los pacientes infectados por el virus, así como a aquellos que han generado protección frente al mismo.En pacientes con clínica compatible y PCR negativa, la presencia de anticuerpos ayudaría a confirmar J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f el diagnóstico de COVID-19 11,12 . El curso temporal de la positividad de la PCR y la seroconversión puede variar en niños y otros grupos, incluida la gran población de individuos asintomáticos, que no se diagnostican sin vigilancia activa.Quedan muchas preguntas por responder, particularmente cuánto tiempo dura la inmunidad potencial en individuos, tanto asintomáticos como sintomáticos, que están infectados con SARS-CoV-2.A nivel laboral, la bibliografía reciente permite hacer la siguiente categorización dentro del plantel de trabajo, considerando el análisis de su perfil inmunológico: Personal activo, que no ha mostrado clínica: la presencia de anticuerpos puede aportar datos relevantes sobre su posible infección actual o previa, permitiendo evitar diseminación y nuevas infecciones. Personal incorporado al trabajo que ha pasado la infección: la información sobre el estado de inmunocompetencia es de gran importancia para planificación frente a nuevos brotes de la pandemia. El personal protegido podría contactarse con pacientes COVID19+, con mínimo riesgo tanto propio como hacia pacientes y colegas 13 .Considerando los perfiles inmunológicos teóricos, el personal afectado a las tareas debe concurrir una semana a sus actividades laborales en forma presencial y dos semanas de trabajo remoto, a fin de minimizar, al reintegrarse, las probabilidades de contagio a sus compañeros y al ambiente hospitalario en general.En el siguiente gráfico (Fig. 4) se muestra cómo se desarrolla el perfil inmunológico de un trabajador en caso de contraer la enfermedad en forma asintomática durante su semana de trabajo presencial en la institución de salud.Si el infectado posee manifestaciones muy leves, o dudosas de infección, el perfil inmunológico mostrado en los gráficos anteriores demostraría que esta siguió su curso. Desde el punto de vista bioquímico las variaciones del nivel de anticuerpos a IgM y luego a IgG indicarían que el trabajador adquirió inmunidad 14 .Como lo indica el significado de la palabra ""inmunidad"", el huésped invadido resistió al agente invasor y por lo tanto no sería posible la transmisión, fundamental para evitar contagios masivos de personal.El SARS-CoV-2, como la mayoría de los virus, invade las células humanas con una exclusiva proliferación intracelular, vinculada a sus características particulares de las cuales, actualmente, hay mucho desconocimiento. En cambio, las reacciones particulares del huésped no tienen grandes variaciones. Estas se referirán principalmente, a diferencias en la duración de la inmunidad, siendo en general más prolongada la inmunidad antivirus que antibacterias 15 .Para estudios epidemiológicos y planificación laboral, es importante considerar la presencia de anticuerpos específicos, con el fin de poder contener los contagios, así como para conocer el porcentaje de aquellos trabajadores que han generado inmunidad protectora.Los criterios considerados conducen a valorar el estado de inmunocompetencia ante el virus y la reincorporación del personal a sus puestos de trabajo, a prevenir el contagio y la diseminación viral, y a colaborar con el impacto económico que genera la pandemia por COVID-19.Se concluye que la seguridad del recambio de personal se fundamenta en la inmunidad, y esto respalda el modelo de segregación en tres equipos: un equipo que trabaja presencialmente durante una semana, y luego es reemplazado por otros dos equipos en las siguientes dos semanas (Fig. 5) .

c7280f9e009af773157e6fb8431a14bdebddabdf,14:1100; www.ecancer.org,"In December 2019, a rising number of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was detected in China. A novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered to be the cause of this new type of respiratory illness, called coronavirus disease-2019, or COVID-19 [1, 2] . The rapid global dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic on 11th March 2020 [3] . As of 25th June 2020, there have been approximately 9.2 million confirmed cases and more than 479,000 deaths worldwide [4] . In Brazil, there have been almost 1,220,000 confirmed cases and more than 54,000 deaths have reported [5] .Special concern is raised for patients with cancer, potentially exposed to a higher incidence of COVID-19. Moreover, they seem to have a higher risk of severe events, such as admission in intensive care units, invasive ventilation or death [6] [7] [8] [9] , and even a higher mortality rate than general population [10] . Previous oncologic treatments may also result in a higher risk of severe events [11] . These negative outcomes could potentially be explained by advanced age, immunosuppression, treatment-related effects and complications, the need for frequent hospital visits and admissions, and impaired functional status [12] .Nevertheless, a large proportion of cancer patients require prompt initiation of treatment because of potential risk of deteriorating their clinical status and presenting complications attributable to disease progression. Moreover, treatment delays may incur in a detrimental impact on the risk of recurrence, potentially compromising survival outcomes [13, 14] . Considering the fact that initiating appropriate oncological treatments for cancer patients could result in a higher risk for COVID-19-related severe events, a question about the need to test asymptomatic patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection before initiating systemic treatment has notably been raised. This systematic review will address the current evidence to answer this question.This systematic review was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework [15] . The electronic databases of Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were systematically searched. The included search terms were as follows: 'COVID-19', 'COVID-2019', 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2', '2019-ncov', 'coronavirus', 'neoplasms', 'cancer', 'drug therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'immunotherapy', 'manag*'. The search strategies are presented in the Appendix (Table A1 ). In order to optimise and expand the search results, we also examined guidelines from some of the main international institutions involved with oncology and COVID-19 research: ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology), ESMO (European Society for Medical Oncology), NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) and IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of America).We have included studies which mentioned testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2 of asymptomatic patients before receiving some systemic treatment, such as chemotherapy, targeted-therapy or immunotherapy. Only studies published in English, from 1 December 2019 to 27 May 2020 were considered eligible. We excluded studies published as case reports or systematic reviews, duplicated articles and studies focused on only surgical or paediatric patients.Titles and abstracts identified by the search strategy were imported into Rayyan QCRI web application and blindly and independently reviewed by two investigators (G.H. and F.F.A.). Full texts of screened papers were retrieved and reviewed by the same authors for inclusion criteria. Disagreements between the two reviewers were resolved by consultation with a third investigator (G.C.J). Study design, date of publication, authors, tumour subtypes, recommendations in relation to SARS-CoV-2 test were extracted from included articles by two reviewers (G.H. and F.F.A.) using a data extraction form. Quality assessment was performed based on Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2011 Levels of Evidence [16] . As most of the included studies were expert consensus, meta-analysis was not performed.We identified 1,163 studies based on database searches and 4 guidelines through the literature search. After removing 242 duplicated studies and reviewing the titles and abstracts, 144 were selected for full-text evaluation. One hundred twenty-six studies were excluded, mainly due to the fact that they did not mention any strategy for testing asymptomatic cancer patients and did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. Therefore, a total of 18 articles were considered eligible and were included in the final analysis, of which 14 studies were identified based on database searches, and four were guidelines ( Figure 1 ). Among those identified on database searches, two articles were cohort studies (level 3 of evidence) and the remaining were expert consensus (level 5).All included studies were published in 2020. Out of 18 articles, five alluded exclusively to solid tumours, seven to hematologic malignancies and six to both groups of diseases. Two cohorts were identified. All other studies were expert consensuses. Two cohort studies which discuss some strategies of testing for SARS-Cov-2 asymptomatic patients were identified [17, 18] . The first one was conducted in Lombardy, Italy. In order to reduce the COVID-19 infection rate, a proactive management was developed, including, among others, text messages to patients asking for symptoms, creation of a COVID-19 surveillance zone and a triage process. These procedures included not only asymptomatic patients before immunosuppressive treatments, but also surgical and hospitalised patients.For patients considered at risk of COVID-19 infection, a triage process was started, which included a low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan of lungs. A nasopharyngeal swab real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was performed on all radiologically or clinically suspected patients. For specifically asymptomatic patients who needed treatment which induced neutropenia or lymphopenia, a simplified triage process has been developed, including a swab test before the treatment. Only a preliminary result of the effects of this process was reported and did not contain the asymptomatic population outcomes separately [17] .The second cohort is from Alzahra Hospital Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. Eighty-five asymptomatic cancer patients were enrolled. All patients underwent a RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and, if positive, a chest X-ray was performed. RT-PCR was repeated until two consecutive negative results.RT-PCR was found to be positive in 7 (8.24%) out of the 85 patients, five of them (71.4%) on systemic therapy and two who had not yet initiated therapy. Cancer types among the positive patients were breast (2 (28.6%)), colorectal (2 (28.6%)), lymphoma (2 (28.6%)), and lung (1(14.1%)). All RT-PCR positive patients eventually became symptomatic: five with mild symptoms and two with severe, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The patients with mild symptoms resumed therapy after virologic clearance (median 18 days). One of the patients admitted on ICU had lung cancer in treatment with anti-PD-L1 therapy and died of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the other had colorectal cancer and remained hospitalised. Importantly, no patient recalled having anosmia or dysgeusia and no health care workers of the screening site were diagnosed with COVID-19. This cohort had some limitations, such as: single-centre experience, with no control group and small sample size [18] .Five articles discussed systematic testing for SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients with solid tumours [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Two were related to lung cancer, one to breast cancer, one to head and neck cancer and one to gynaecologic cancer. Four out of five studies considered offering the test to asymptomatic patients before starting the treatment. Table 1 summarises the recommendations of each study.Considering that lung cancer patients can present similar clinical symptoms to COVID-19, and oncologic radiological findings can resemble or overlap with virus infections, these concordances can pose a challenge to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in this specific population. Banna et al [19] recommend that lung cancer patients undergo testing for COVID-19 before treatment initiation and in case of a positive case of a family member or caregiver. Calabrò et al [20] suggest that lung cancer patients should perform SARS-CoV-2 testing before the beginning of treatment. They also emphasise that a greater availability of tests is crucial to the feasibility of this strategy. Head and neck cancers also deserve particular considerations, mainly because of the unique location in the aerodigestive tract, a recognised region that harbours coronavirus. Chaves et al [21] recommend, combined with a detailed medical history and physical examination, SARS-CoV-2 testing before curative treatment, and before any hospitalisation, with the possibility of a 2-week treatment delay in case of a positive test, to protect not only the patient, but also other patients and healthcare workers.Regarding breast and gynaecological cancer, both studies suggest, if tests are available, testing for COVID-19 before initiating immunosuppressive therapies, even for asymptomatic patients [22, 23] . Pothuri et al [23] also recommend that patients receiving immunotherapy should involve careful attention and have COVID-19 testing in case of respiratory symptoms, fever or new CT findings.Patients with haematologic malignancies may have a higher risk of developing COVID-19 for multiple and potentially overlapping reasons. They often receive highly immunosuppressive treatments in addition to the cancer-related immunosuppression and are at high risk of opportunistic infections. Seven articles discuss the management of SARS-CoV-2 testing all patients before starting treatment [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] (Table 2) . Nevertheless, each hematologic neoplasm might be associated with an intrinsic risk of COVID-19, due to diverse disease biology and related treatments. Thus, recommendations are frequently published by neoplasm subtypes separately.At the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, the haematologic cancer patients are not routinely being tested for SARS-CoV-2 before beginning standard chemotherapy. The capability of performing tests should be considered, and the risks of delaying effective therapies when a test is positive are uncertain. Therefore, the tests are prioritised to symptomatic patients and prior to surgeries, stem-cell transplantation (SCT), and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy In some cases, depending on the risk and the disease, such as asymptomatic patients with indolent lymphoma, can be considered deferring therapy for few weeks or months [26] .Paul et al [25] recommended nasopharyngeal swab and COVID-19 serology, if available, for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who will receive myelosuppressive chemoimmuno treatments, such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, or bendamustine plus rituximab. There is a a recommendation to prefer oral regimens to minimise hospital visits (such as ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, and venetoclax). Percival et al [26] 5 May 2020 Not specified (1) SARS-CoV-2 testing are not routinely performed before standard chemotherapy;(2) Tests should be considered prior to SCT and CAR T-cell therapy Paul et al [25] 11 May 2020 Leukaemia (1) SARS-CoV-2 testing for patients with CML on TKI or with CLL who will receive myelosuppressive chemoimmuno treatment, such as FCR or bendamustine plus rituximab; (2) SARS-CoV-2 testing before allogenic SCT Koffman et al [24] 30 April 2020 CLL Survey with CLL specialist: Koffman et al [24] reported a survey performed by CLL specialists. Considering an unlimited capacity of COVID-19 testing, 23% suggested testing for all patients. Nevertheless, in a scenario with limited test availability, most specialists did not recommend universal testing and 62% suggested testing only symptomatic patients. In this setting, as discussed by Perini GF and cols., the testing strategy before treatment should be individualised. They also recommend not delaying treatment in aggressive lymphomas such as Burkitt lymphoma, plasmablastic lymphoma and to prioritise outpatient salvage regimens in the relapsed setting. Besides SCT should not be delayed, SARS-CoV-2 testing should also be performed both before autologous and allogenic SCT [25] . For all lymphoid malignancies, it is recommended to postpone medical appointments for patients in complete remission or for patients in which no immediate change therapy is expected. Virtual consultation/counselling is encouraged [27] .Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) may be at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for several reasons, including disease, treatment and patient characteristics. These patients have a higher age at diagnosis and are more likely to have comorbidities. In addition, the disease can cause immunodeficiency and the treatment can aggravate the immunosuppression. three articles mentioned a strategy of COVID-19 testing these patients before treatment initiation. All three articles recommend performing SARS-CoV-2 testing for all patients before autologous SCT [28] [29] [30] . Al Saleh et al [28] and Terpos et al [30] also consider the testing before starting any immunosuppressive treatments.Four guidelines of the main international institutions involved with oncology and COVID-19 research were selected and discuss systematic testing for SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic cancer patients (Table 3) .All ASCO recommendations are based upon available testing resources and laboratory capacity; therefore, they allocated cancer patients into priority groups to be tested. Asymptomatic individuals prior to receipt of immunosuppressive therapy are priority 3 for testing, after symptomatic and hospitalised patients. ASCO recommends that all new patients prior to receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, SCT, biologic therapy, immunotherapy or high-dose corticosteroids, should be tested 72 to 48 hours before commencing treatment and, during treatment, every patient should be screened with a standardised questionnaire. If possible, they recommend the test occurs at a site other than the hospital or cancer care clinic [31] . Table 3 . Guideline recommendations.After considering availability of tests and laboratory capacity: (1) asymptomatic new patients should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 48-72h prior to initiating treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, long acting biologic therapy, cellular immunotherapy or high-dose corticosteroids; (2) screening 48-72h prior to each new cycle of treatment with a standardised questionnaire ESMO [32] (1) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing should be proposed to all patients undergoing chemotherapy or immunotherapy and ideally before each treatment cycle; If availability of tests is limited, RT-PCR should be offered only for symptomatic patients; (2) serology should be offered to all cancer patients. If not available, limit tests to all patients undergoing chemotherapy or immunotherapy or any other active anti-cancer treatment IDSA [33] (1) SARS-CoV-2 testing asymptomatic patients before immunosuppressive procedures (i.e. cytotoxic chemotherapy, solid organ or stem cell transplantation, long acting biologic therapy, cellular immunotherapy or high-dose corticosteroids) regardless of known exposure to COVID-19, 48-72h prior to treatment initiation; (2) screening with a standardised questionnaire for symptoms and exposure should be performed in between hospital visits.NCCN [34] For hematologic malignancies and stem cell transplant: testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered asymptomatic patients before receiving chemotherapy that will result in significant and prolonged immunosuppression. ESMO consensus also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing should be recommended to all patients undergoing chemotherapy or immunotherapy and ideally before each treatment cycle. Considering the availability of resources in each cancer centre, and limited access to testing, RT-PCR should be offered only to symptomatic patients [32] .IDSA recommends routinely testing all cancer patients, including asymptomatic individuals, before immunosuppressive therapies, regardless of a known exposure to COVID-19. IDSA also advises that testing should ideally be performed as close to the planned treatment as possible (within 48-72 hours). In the outpatient setting, where patients require frequent visits to the clinic or infusion room, IDSA recommends regular screening with a standardised questionnaire for symptoms and known exposures between visits [33] .Opposed to the other guidelines, NCCN does not recommend testing for all asymptomatic patients being considered for systemic therapy. Instead, they suggest several measures that can be implemented to provide cancer care safely, such as considering alternative dosing schedules, switching to oral therapies (if available) and administration at home through home care nurses. There is only one exception, namely, patients with hematologic malignancies and/or undergoing SCT [34] .Cancer centres all over the world are dealing with different challenges regarding cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic, which go from lower availability of diagnostic/workup studies to deciding which patients should go in-person to the centre and even if treatments should be postponed [13, 35] . In a large cohort including only oncologic patients, approximately 4% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were reported as asymptomatic [10] . The fact that cancer patients represent a population at a higher risk of developing COVID-19 makes the decisions regarding the patients more critical. A mortality rate of 13% among cancer patients has been described [10] , compared to 1.4% in an unselected patient population [2] . In patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, delaying systemic therapies should be strongly considered [31, 36] . Therefore, deciding whether to test asymptomatic patients before starting systemic treatment is one of the oncologists' daily practice issues.Our systematic review failed to identify a good level of evidence to support the routine test for SARS-CoV-2 before initiating systemic treatment even though this routine was uniformly recommended among the selected publications. This brings some limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results of this review.A positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test could guide the decision of delaying the systemic oncologic treatment and possibly avoiding COVID-19 severe complications in an immunosuppressed patient [12] , but this assumption has not been confirmed to date. In general population, COVID-19 asymptomatic patients seem to have less decrease in CD 4+ lymphocyte counts and a shorter duration of viral shedding, but this has not yet been reported in cancer patients [37] . In addition, confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients must be isolated, protecting other immunocompromised patients who frequent the cancer care facilities and the health workers against COVID-19 [38] . Testing patients before initiating a systemic treatment could also prevent legal issues in case of poor outcomes due to COVID-19 during chemotherapy nadir, for instance.In contrast, there are negative points in performing the SARS-CoV-2 test before starting the systemic treatment. The RNA test for prevalent infection is an essential part of the diagnosis strategy [39] . The RT-PCR method for viral detection is usually characterised by fast results, high sensitivity and specificity. The clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR tests for the new coronavirus varies from 50% to 80% [40] [41] [42] . However, it is worth mentioning that this is true when we are dealing with symptomatic patients, but the role of testing for asymptomatic cancer patients remains unclear [43] . In a prospective study with 400 asymptomatic health-care workers weekly tested for SARS-CoV2, only 12 patients who tested positive had no symptoms the week before or after the test and were diagnosed with COVID-19 [44] . FDA granted accelerated emergency use authorisation for COVID-19 RT-PCR test for patients with suspected upper respiratory tract infection, but asymptomatic patients were exclusion criteria for testing [45] .A review analysed seven previously published studies providing results on 1,330 RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 and time since onset of symptoms or exposure. The results demonstrated over the 4 days of infection before the typical time of symptom onset, the probability of a false-negative result in an infected person decreased from 100 on day 1 to 67% (95% CI, 27%-94%) on day 4. On the day of symptom onset, the median false-negative rate was 38% (95% CI, 18%-65%). Thus, the false-negative rate for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing is highly variable especially within the days of no symptoms [46] .Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities are related to multiple pre-analytical and analytical factors [47] . The main points highlighted were the lack of standardisation for the collection of material, insufficient viral load, and specimens, time and conservation of samples, use of nonvalidated tests, contamination during the procedure, disease incubation period and risk of recombination and active mutation [48] .Health systems can be overwhelmed during a viral pandemic emergency in all areas, from preventive and diagnostic measures to resources for treatment [49] . The rapidly growing imbalance between supply and demand for medical resources in many countries represents a worrying issue [50] . Hence, in countries like Brazil, where financial resources directed to health care are scarce, the expense of recommending testing for everyone, including asymptomatic individuals, should be taken into account.Other concerns on this theme would be the ideal frequency for performing RT-PCR and the possibility of patients being infected between the test day and the medical appointment. In this systematic review, we were unable to answer this question, and hence, these are matters that each service tended to follow its own recommendation.As mentioned, the main oncological societies in the world have developed guidelines to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients. The scope of these proposed guidelines is to categorise patients as high, medium or low priority, based on the clinical criteria intrinsic to the patient and the disease, in order to plan their management course accordingly [31] [32] [33] [34] .That said, a question is raised when we come across a positive test an asymptomatic cancer patient. In our view, it is necessary to make an individual risk-benefit assessment, evaluating case-by-case, and proceed with cancer treatment whether the benefits outweigh the risks. Table 4 summarises the pros and cons of RT-PCR test for asymptomatic cancer patients.Given the current unusual situation, pragmatic approaches are required to deal with the challenges of treating cancer patients, without risking their care. Clear communication and education about hand hygiene, face masks, infection control measures, signs and symptoms of the COVID-19, high-risk travel or exposure and the importance of reporting new symptoms to their health care providers should be reinforced.Due to the paucity of structured data to routinely submit patients initiating treatment to COVID testing and the high false-negative rates, our institution has considered among our group of oncologists and haematologists all the pros and cons in regard to SARS-CoV-2 testing for asymptomatic patients before initiating oncologic treatment, and decided to follow a selective approach. We do not recommend routinely testing all cancer patients before initiating systemic treatments. Based upon the highest frequency of severe events, we advise testing asymptomatic patients prior to SCTs, any systemic treatment of hematopoietic neoplasms, concurrent chemoradiation regimens (presenting with high frequency of post-treatment lymphopenia) or in those patients with lung cancer or head and neck cancer initiating systemic treatments with immunosuppressive properties.Suggested steps to reduce the risk of exposure include a call to the patient 48 hours prior to their scheduled appointment and on the day of treatment to screen for any symptoms associated with COVID-19, contact history, as well as recent travel history. During treatment, all patients should be screened 48 hours before each new cycle of therapy. We strongly recommend a detailed questionnaire that embraces all relevant aspects of COVID-19. The questionnaire which we proposed in our institution is presented in the Appendix Figure A1 . Based on screening results, health care workers should test any patient identified as having whichever suspected symptom, besides considering including a chest computed tomography scan. The combination of clinical features with RT-PCR might increase the pretest sensitivity. As testing becomes more widely available, it may be reasonable expand this approach to test all asymptomatic patients who will be receiving immunosuppressive anticancer therapy. This systematic review has demonstrated that there is a lack of robust evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 testing of asymptomatic patients before cancer treatment even though this routine is mostly suggested among the guidelines and expert consensuses.The crucial point is to individualise the centres and their socioeconomic circumstances, considering the accessibility to testing resources, laboratory capacity and regional epidemiology. Based upon this review our group proposed our own recommendations. We plan to collect and publish prospective data after adopting our institution`s consensus. Finally, it is important to mention that these recommendations may change in the future, depending on new scientific evidence.This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest. What is the name of your medical oncologist/ hematologist or radiation oncologist? _______________________. He/she will be contacted to plan the next steps based on this questionnaire.If you have reported some of these symptoms and are undergoing cancer treatment, you do not necessarily have COVID-19, as these symptoms may be associated with cancer treatment. You will be required to undergo a diagnostic test to verify or rule out COVID-19.Most patients with COVID-19 will be treated at home. Only the most severe cases will undergo hospital treatment.

3788c95220f40db41f027ecaa28b9cb9d0920391,Perspective Piece Malaria Situation in the Peruvian Amazon during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Malaria continues to be a high-priority public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, 1 including the Peruvian Amazon, which is also endemic for several other acute febrile diseases such as dengue and leptospirosis. In Peru, malaria is concentrated primarily in the Loreto department, where transmission is maintained in rural and periurban communities.In 2017, the Peruvian government brought a formal malaria elimination plan into law, the Malaria Zero Program (MZP), that takes a community-level approach to control malaria with the goal of elimination by 2030. The MZP has three complementary and partially overlapping phases: 1) the control phase, testing and treating, which focuses on the elimination of symptomatic infections and has a duration of 3 years; 2) a firstphase (elimination phase), the goal of which is to eliminate malaria parasites from individuals at a regional level by targeting asymptomatic and low-parasite-density infections (in addition to symptomatic infections) for an extended span of 10 years; and 3) a final elimination phase, to identify and ameliorate residual malaria transmission foci, including reintroductions which is expected to last 15 years. 2, 3 The MZP is currently in the first (control) phase prioritized in the high endemicity region of Loreto. Since 2018, the number of malaria cases has decreased significantly ( Figure 1 ), a reduction of 50% from 2017 to 2019. This reduction has been attributed to work carried out in Loreto, such as test-and-treat strategies, provision of free antimalarials under control of the Ministry of Health (MoH), and larviciding and pyrethroid spraying. 4 Malaria control activities in Peru take place primarily in areas with a high number of indigenous communities which are most affected by malaria. Activities focus on active case detection and include the delivery of malaria rapid diagnostic tests and antimalarial drugs to trained health promoters, who are key to diagnosing and treating uncomplicated malaria cases in their communities. Another important malaria control activity in the Loreto region is based on the use of insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets for vector control. Community health promoters also conduct educational activities in communities, another part of malaria control programs. All of these activities are routinely carried out by each institution that provides health services in malaria-endemic areas. 2,3,5 These activities are strengthened by the MZP, which has an assigned budget for malaria control in areas of very high and high risk of malaria transmission. All of these organized activities require inperson work and contact, which make them vulnerable to interruptions by external events such as COVID-19.The health system in the Loreto region is structured as health networks (Redes) and, within them, micro-networks (MicroRedes), where each MicroRed has a number of health posts as the unit providing basic health care. Each health post is required to report the number of malaria cases every week to the Directorate of Health of Loreto.When COVID-19 started to spread throughout Peru, the Peruvian government established strict quarantine measures and a nationwide lockdown in March 2020. Despite the relatively quick response, the pandemic continued to spread, hitting the Loreto region particularly hard. In the face of the current obvious urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic impacting a region with many other acute febrile illnesses, we aimed to gain insight about possible associations of the pandemic with the malaria situation in the Loreto region of the Peruvian Amazon.During the first months of lockdown in Peru, the rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections destabilized the Peruvian health system in manifold ways, especially in the capital of the Loreto region, Iquitos. The urgency and rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in Iquitos (Table 1) , 6 the lack of evidence-based clinical protocols, the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), the lack of oxygen, and, in some way, frank panic at all hospitals throughout the country have exacerbated the public health crisis. This crisis was prominent at all hospitals in Iquitos-which became dedicated COVID-19 hospitalsbecause healthcare workers lacked PPE, leading to many becoming ill from COVID-19, and some even dying. Hence, MoH-supported facilities (health posts and hospitals) have closed for all clinical activities, except for COVID-19. These closures have contributed to delays in reporting malaria testing and confirmed cases in the entire region. On the other hand, people at home were also affected in diverse ways, many seemed to be dominated by fear, especially of attending health facilities. All of this has limited the collecting of key data, which hampers the determination of whether COVID-19 may have negative effects on national programs and research after 4 months of lockdown, and after that critical situation in Iquitos.At first sight, available data and observations seem to be limited by the availability of routine surveillance and basic implementation strategies in Loreto communities, which are usually carried out as part of regular activities of the MoH and supplemented by MZP and funded research projects. Regular interventions carried out by the MZP plummeted from the second half of April, when COVID-19 cases began their exponential increase in Loreto. Other malaria control activities, such as vector control, active detection, and community education, were postponed because of COVID-19, although from February 10 to February 28, the intra-household recycling activities with residual insecticide were reported for 656 houses in communities around the Iquitos-Nauta road between the 15th and the 23rd km, protecting 1,815 people. According to MZP preliminary reports, the number of malariaspecific interventions and activities to date in 2020 has dropped by at least 60% compared with the same period in 2019. This situation may well continue until regional authorities organize the new way to do routine public health interventions under the COVID-19 situation. In addition, from 414 health posts, only 80% have been able to comply with the weekly notification in recent reporting periods, likely because of the COVID-19 situation. Thus, the health post malaria notification rate decreased to 62% during the pandemic lockdown. Nevertheless, recently, the malaria regional database has experienced some variability in the quality of information provided. Importantly, malaria is likely to resurge in the region in the absence of malaria diagnosis and treatment, leading to increased mortality and morbidity.The apparent decline observed on the number of malaria cases since the pandemic started is remarkable. The reduction from February to March was 20%; from March to April, 44%; from April to May 21, 88%; and from May to June 21, 99%, ultimately reaching as few as 35 malaria cases in the last week of June. These reductions are striking for the region's known high transmission season (January-May). Moreover, the decrease in cases in Loreto after the outbreak was not only reported for malaria but also for dengue and leptospirosisother major causes of acute undifferentiated fever-the highest number of cases reported before the pandemic ( Table 2 ).The precise reasons why this COVID-19 situation may be associated with problems with malaria control cannot be fully determined at this time. Several factors likely contribute to an apparent decrease in cases. In addition to administrative shutdown, it is likely that people are not going to health facilities to get diagnosed (in case they do not have a health promoter in their communities) because the health centers are closed, or because of the convenience of feeling safe taking just an antipyretic at home and avoiding the risk of getting COVID-19. Furthermore, quarantine has compelled people to stay at home and limited their access to public transportation. Research projects have also been affected at many institutions after the government declared the lockdown. Universities and research institutions had to completely suspend all laboratory and fieldwork activities. Consequently, research studies on diseases other than COVID-19 were paused. Closing laboratories and stopping research studies challenge the collaborative relationship between government and academia, so this situation could be a setback on the way to eliminate malaria. This situation is particularly worrisome because previous attempts to eliminate malaria in the region suggest that without focused control, a rapid bounce back effect can take place even after years of efforts. 5 However, the full association of COVID-19 with this unprecedented situation of malaria control has yet to be determined. Not only will this pandemic challenge our advances in malaria control in the Loreto region of Peru but it will also affect the way we conduct research and interventions from now on. Because these activities cannot be indefinitely halted, they must be restarted following appropriate biosafety measures. New biosecurity strategies should be implemented, specifically the use of PPEs to protect us from the hazards of field and laboratory work, especially when we have to take samples, because of the high rate of COVID-19 infections in this area.In Iquitos, COVID-19 cases (symptomatic and asymptomatic) are being controlled (Figure 2 ), but expansion remains of high concern, especially after the suspension of the lockdown in Peru, which obligates the MoH to strengthen the strategies to control not only COVID-19 but also other endemic diseases in the Loreto region.The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have direct, measurable impacts on patients with endemic tropical and neglected infectious diseases and on related research. Here, we have described an apparent associate of COVID-19 with reduction in malaria control activities as carried out by the Peruvian MZP. We now confront the challenge of delivering malaria-related health care in remote areas where COVID-19 cases increase, especially affecting endangered indigenous communities. National and regional health systems remain challenged to provide adequate quality health care for those vulnerable, affected populations. The effect of COVID-19 on malaria resurgence and excess morbidity and mortality due to malaria can only be determined by prospective surveillance; however, this may be accomplished.",Peru,first author,2020-09-03,9
a59886b66fb7f2a2c1c18dd87ef94d5adbe1ba70,Genomic analysis reveals local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in early pandemic phase in Peru,"A new coronavirus called SARS-COV-2 causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that currently produced a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus of the beta coronavirus genus that belongs to SARS-type viruses (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) (1) . These viruses usually cause mild respiratory infections in healthy adults and more severe and sometimes fatal effects in older adults and people with comorbidities (2) . The SARS-CoV-2 virus is an enveloped virus with a 29.903 kb, positive sense, and single-stranded RNA genome. This genome is one of the largest among RNA viruses, and it encodes four structural proteins (E, M, N, and S), whose function is to protect the viral genome and 16 non-structural proteins (NSP) that regulate RNA synthesis and its processing, such as RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (NSP12) and helicase (NSP13). Simultaneously, other proteins facilitate the function of viral enzymes, such as NSP7 and NSP10 (3) .In December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus initially caused an outbreak of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, China; since then, it has spread to almost all countries in the world.For this reason, the WHO declared it a pandemic on the 11th March, and later this new disease was named COVID-19 (4, 5) . WHO ranked the COVID-19 as the sixth international public health emergency of global concern after H1N1 (2009), Polio (2014), Ebola from West Africa (2014), Zika (2016), and Ebola from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2019).Thus, due to the virus´s high transmission capacity, a growing incidence of infection, and the ability to be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, and call on the world's health systems to cooperate to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (6) .At the date of this publication, the COVID-19 has caused more than 16 and a half million confirmed cases and more than 650,000 deaths worldwide. America is one of the most affected regions by the disease, with more than 8,800,000 affected patients, where the USA and Brazil are the most affected countries (4,263,531 and 2,442,375 confirmed cases respectively). Peru ranks seventh among the countries with the most confirmed cases worldwide (more than 600,000 infected) , and first place in mortality rate (more than 28 000 deaths) (8) . The first Peruvian case of COVID-19 was notified on 5 th March 2020 in a 25-year-old man who arrived in the country after visiting Spain, France, and the Czech Republic.Subsequently, new cases began to be notified in other cities of Peru in such a way that the Peruvian government decreed the international closure of borders and mandatory quarantine at the national level on 16 th March.To control the COVID-19 burden, it is necessary to understand the genomic structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, identify new mutations associated with its transmission, and infer these transmission routes. Knowledge of these aspects will allow the development of vaccines, implement better disease control, and generate new diagnostic methods. In this context, our study seeks to contribute with genomic analysis of the early transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus circulating in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemics in Peru.We produced seven overlapping fragments of a size between 5 Kb to 6 Kb from the genome of SARS-COV-2 by RT-PCR ( Figure 1 ). In some cases, we also get nonspecific amplification, eliminated during the fragment's purification.We submitted 34 SARS-COV-2 genome sequences from Peru to the international Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database. We identified six SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages (A2, A5, B.1, B1.1, B1.1.1, B1.5) according to GISAID and Pangolin analysis ( Table 2) . Most Peruvian SARS-CoV-2 sequences here obtained were classified as clade B.1 (38%, n = 13), and particularly within the sub-clade B.1.1.1 (29.4%, n = 10) ( Table 2) .The genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus from Peru, compared to the genomes of the viruses reported in different countries, were grouped into genetic clades G (85.3%) and S (14.7%), probably transmitted to people returning from Europe countries (such as Spain, Italy and Germany) and Asians countries (Taiwan). We also observed the presence of new Peruvian genotypes of the virus in early March and early April 2020, consistent with a local transmission ( Figure 2 ).The Peruvian SARS-CoV-2 grouped in clade G presents the characteristic D614G mutation in the Spike (S) protein. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that case zero (LIM-01-2) was closely related to cases reported between 6 th and 10 th March (LIM-INS-002, LIM-INS-003,   LIM-INS-004, LIM-INS-009, LIM-INS-013, and LIM-INS-014) The other cases began to circulate after the border closure. These introductions gave rise to other cases, which originated viruses with their unique mutations, generating an autochthonous transmission of the virus.We found various nucleotide variations in the Peruvian SARS-CoV-2 genomes compared with the reference genome of the Wuhan strain (NC_045512), some of which suffered amino acid changes (Table 3 and S1). We observed the C241T nucleotide variation in the 5'-UTR region in 30 of 34 genomes. Some genomes present the D3G variation (9/34) in the M protein, a variation found only in samples from the PER-CII cluster. In ORF6 we found the amino acid variation I36T (1/34).Other variations encountered were V29L (1/34) in ORF7a and S5L (1/34) in ORF7b.In ORF8, we found the L84S variation (5/34) , while the protein N presented the following changes, S197L (2/34), R203K (13/34), and G204R (13/34). In this gene, we observed that R203K, G204R, and the synonyms change 28881G>A, are characteristic of PER-CI cluster.We do not find amino acid variations in the gene E and ORF10 (Table 3 and S1). Likewise, we found nucleotide variations in a minority of reads in some positions of 13 sequenced genomes that we do not observe in the final assembled genome (Table 4) .At the end of December 2019, discovering a new virus that could cause respiratory disease in humans was announced in Wuhan-China. At that time, we all thought that the virus would take a long time for it to spread to other continents; however, after three months, the first case was reported in Peru, and from that time to the present, we continue with more positive cases per day being difficult to control this pandemic.In this context, it is necessary to research to know the genomic diversity of SARS Cov2 in different regions of the country and share this data with scientists interested in developing diagnostic methods and possible vaccines.In this study, we report the main clades and genomic lineages of 34 genomes of SARS- (Table S1 ).We observed several mutations at different positions in the genome of circulating SARS-COV-2. It is worth highlighting the presence of the C241T (30/35) mutation in the 5 'UTR region important for transcription and viral packaging (12, 13) . The P4715L mutation (14408 C>T) in the viral polyprotein ORF1ab located in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region (position 323 of RdRP), which could be related to the increase in the mutation rate (14) . This polymerase dynamics simulation indicates that this P4715L is a more stable RdRP variant (15) . The spike protein´s D614G mutation is related to the increase of the virus´s infectivity and is present in 29 of the 35 genomes reported in Peru (16) . Likewise, it is remarkable that the I119V mutation (present in 8 from the 34 genomes) is present in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 region of the spike, and we detected no variations in the RBD region.Meanwhile, the R203K (13/34) and G204R (13/34) variants of the N gene could contribute to the reduction of the nucleocapsid´s conformational entropy (17) . ORF3a is a carrier for K+ and Ca2+ ions (18) Laboratory of the Peruvian National Institute of Health for diagnostic confirmation were stored at -80 °C. We selected samples from the first cases reported in Peru and from different regions of the country. The first 34 samples, from early March to early April, were chosen following the criteria that they had an adequate viral load (Ct ˂30) after analyzing the molecular diagnosis results by real-time RT-PCR. Viral RNA was purified from 140 L of viral transport medium, using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. The purified RNA samples were processed by reverse transcription and PCR to amplify overlapping fragments, using primers designed (Table 1) The amplified fragments (2 ng) were processed using the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep kit and indexes adapters (Illumina) following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer.The library was sequenced using a Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit, a MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 cartridge (500-cycles), and the MiSeq sequencer (Illumina). The fastq files generated were cleaned using Groomer and Trimmomatic (https://usegalaxy.org/). The reads mapped to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=Severe+acute+respiratory+syndrome+coronavirus + 2 + AND + Wuhan) using BWA-ME (https://usegalaxy.org). Finally, the genomes were assembled using SPAdes and compared to the reference genome using CONTIGuator ",Peru,abstract,2020-09-06,9
ab4e5ed32aa269ab5ee1f7801460bf8747094bf3,Is It High Time to Increase Elite Soccer Substitutions Permanently?,"The overall load of soccer matches (i.e., cognitive decision making, tactical and technical proficiency inside a set of well-advanced physical capacities) results in postmatch fatigue which is associated with high match-induced muscle damage and inflammatory responses, dehydration, and glycogen depletion [1] [2] [3] . A systematic review concluded that a period of~3 days postmatch, for example, is insufficient to fully recover homeostatic balance caused by a soccer match load [1] . Compared to basketball, volleyball, and handball, soccer is the most demanding sport with much higher muscle damage and inflammatory markers than the other sports [4] . Indeed, another systematic review showed that soccer has the largest total running distances, including high-intensity running and sprinting in comparison with futsal, basketball, and handball [5] , and increments in soccer demands have been recognized through the years [6] . Barnes et al. investigated physical and technical soccer performance across a 7-season period in the English Premier League. Their data confirmed an increment of ""only"" 2% in total distance covered per match, however they reported impressive increments in distances covered in high-intensity running distance (~30%), actions (~50%), sprint distance (~35%), and the number of sprints (~85%) [6] . This high-intensity increment may be a concern because there is a strong association between high-speed running and injuries [7, 8] . Additionally, due to commitments for economic and entertainment reasons, soccer has presented congested schedules (i.e., multiple games within 72-96 h), which is a relevant issue for medical staff [9, 10] . For instance, data over 11 seasons (from 27 teams) exhibited that matches with short recovery (≤four days) were related to augmented muscle injury rates when compared with longer recovery periods (≥six days) [11] , generating the average cost of an elite player injured of~€500,000 (~1 month) [12] . Soccer is also associated with long-term sequelae due to the high loading on hip and knee joints [13] , early osteoarthritis and poor quality of life after retirement [14] . Additionally, soccer injuries may produce a meaningful loss of time from participation, or even early retirement [15] .To confront the issues aforementioned, several studies have investigated strategies to improve recovery, and to minimize soccer-induced muscle damage and fatigue [2] . For example, compression garments [16, 17] , cold water immersion [2] , myofascial release [18] , etc. The literature has a myriad of studies seeking to find smarter training programs or better control of the training load [8] , nutritional aids [19] , sleep hygiene [20] , and other strategies. Surprisingly, there are no scientific studies investigating the potential issues caused by the rules of the game itself. Reasoning scientifically, the rules of any sport are the ""cause"", and the ""way to play"" is the effect. The injury rate is noticeably higher (~10 times) during soccer matches than during training sessions [21] . Therefore, rule evaluation to manage the main causes of issues (i.e., match) is necessary, since rules should often be updated to enhance any sport for safety (e.g., shin guards), prevention (e.g., time for hydration), entertainment, cleaner (e.g., video referee), etc.On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization announced the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic, and the regular sports season worldwide was interrupted. After months of interruption (~3 or 4 months), most sports leagues have resumed the season. Due to the overlap of competition schedules caused by the COVID-19 interruption, most soccer teams will face very congested schedules on returning (e.g., games every Sunday and Wednesday), which potentially increase the risk of injuries (e.g., muscle and ligament injuries) [10, 11] . Thus, The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) has changed the substitution rule (temporarily) increasing it from three substitutions to up to five for each team (each match), aiming to minimize the impact on player welfare [22] . There is no research regarding a deep investigation on the impact of potential rule-induced physical demands in soccer (e.g., area per player and fewer substitutes forced by the law of the game), and none comparing different sports in this context. Understanding the potential differences between the rules which may impact sport-specific fatigue and eventually injury risk [10] might be useful for practical applications (e.g., updating and enhancing rules for a safer/healthier sport). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of the rule-induced physical demands among soccer, futsal, basketball and handball, focusing on the substitution rules (including changes due to . We hypothesized that soccer would have potentially higher rule-induced physical demands than other team sports, even considering the changes due to COVID-19.In order to meet the aims of this study, first, rule-specific information for the international top men (elite) was obtained from each team sport selected. Two authors independently highlighted which rules (in each sport) might have an impact on the physical demands of the players (e.g., total distance covered). For example, the size of the goal (or basket) has a minimal potential effect on physical demands. On the other hand, the dimensions of the court/field (absolute area and relative area per player), time of playing, and the number of substitutes (absolute and relative) logically impact the demands of the sport.After a consensus between the two authors, the data were collected. Then, data were organized in Excel sheets for calculations (e.g., percentage of players available-relative substitutions allowed/total players available). Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed and confronted with the literature already existent on physiological (e.g., muscle damage and inflammatory markers) and time−motion (e.g., number of sprints, jumps, distances covered in several speed zones) sport demands.Four invasive team sports (i.e., soccer, futsal, handball, and basketball) were selected because these sports have several similarities, and are popular worldwide. All are invasive intermittent team sports, have body contact, require quick (and accurate) decision making and optimum scanning (reading the game), and the purpose is to score a goal or a basket on the opponent's territory [23, 24] .The specific rule information of each team sport was obtained from official websites in June of 2020: soccer, futsal [25] , basketball [26] , and handball [27] . To meet the current research aims, specific information from the rules which may impact the physical demand of the players was collected. For instance, information about the number of players on the field (soccer) or court (other team sports), availability of substitutes on the bench area and when they are allowed to play (including the substitutions changes due to COVID-19), time load of each team sport, time-outs, field/court dimensions and the relation between and among that information.The number of games per season (2018-2019) from the top four teams (international, men, elite) of each sport were obtained from websites of each team or official federation. The teams for each sport are presented as a table in the supplementary document (Table S1 ).This study developed a descriptive, cross-sectional design, therefore quantitative data presentation is essentially descriptive in nature. Due to the nature of this study (i.e., there is only one rule for each sport), the data were not judged from a traditional statistical point of view (e.g., p value, mean values, and standard deviation). Alternatively, a qualitative analysis was performed, conducted by two authors focusing on the potential practical implications. All other authors read this analysis carefully, and edits have been combined. Such kind of data analysis (e.g., progressive statistics and case research) has been used in Sports Medicine and Sports Science fields [28, 29] .Data about the number of players, substitutions, time (total, breaks, time-outs), and dimensions of the field/court are presented in Table 1 . Overall, soccer rules demand higher dimensions of the field and lower substitutions, both in absolute and relative values.Soccer has no time-out during the game, but futsal, basketball, and handball do not have this rule. The offside rule may increase the physical demand (please, see discussion). Table 2 shows simulations to equate the soccer dimension, changing the current court dimensions. * international and official competitions-minimum dimensions (for soccer); maximum allowed by rules; ** soccer has changed number of maximum substitutions allowed from 3 to 5, due to postponing the regular calendar caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; *** unlimited, using total players available (C).

Note that for soccer we added the C-19 * and S100% ** simulations to equate (like panel B explanation).This study shows for the first time that elite soccer presents remarkably higher overall rule-induced physical demands than futsal, basketball, and handball, and increasing elite soccer substitutions permanently (e.g., unlimited) might mitigate the overall soccer demands. Our findings corroborate our hypothesis, and also studies involving time−motion and physiological demands [4, 5] . The principal reason is the higher surface area of the soccer field, in both absolute (eight to fifteen times) and relative terms (per player; four to eight times), than those of the other sports here studied. The restricted possibility to replace players during the games (i.e., only three substitutions according to the regular rule) is crucial; the other team sports (i.e., futsal, basketball and handball) can limitlessly replace players. Even considering the increased number of substitutions during the match due to the COVID-19 changes (i.e., from three to up to five substitutions), the discrepancy in the soccer rule-induced physical demands is still too big (Figure 3 ). The current data (see H, I, N, O, P and Q in Table 1 and Figure 3B ,D) support that soccer rule-induced physical demands may cause an overload (overall demands) on the players compared with the other team sports here investigated. As the injury rate is clearly higher (~10 times) during the matches than during the training sessions [21] , the rule change due to COVID-19 seems not to be enough.Recently a study concluded that nonstarters (i.e., substitutes who played) had a lower internal and external load, considering matches and training sessions, during congested schedules [30] , confirming that matches are a crucial training component (i.e., substitutes might be detrained). Allowing soccer to increase substitutions permanently across the games, would potentially be a ""game changer"". This would be easier to implement in comparison to other actions; e.g., reducing the number of competitions, since soccer has a huge economic impact [31] . Because the congested schedules in soccer are a relevant concern, and it is related to accumulated fatigue and higher risk of injuries [9] [10] [11] 32] , unlimited substitutions might be an intelligent decision. Allowing soccer unlimited substitutions (e.g., only three opportunities to make substitutions to avoid disruption or allowing the turnover of players like futsal), would likely prevent the drop in the intensity of the matches, especially in the second half [1, 33, 34] . Evidence exists for an improvement. For example, substitutes covered a greater high-intensity-running distance [35] , and midfield substitutes covered a greater overall distance and distance at high-intensity compared to other midfield team-mates who remained on the pitch for the same period of the game [36] . Additionally, Hill et al. [37] concluded that substitutes may provide physical and/or tactical impetus, corroborating a basketball study that showed better scoring after substitutions [38] .Although a comparison among different sports is limited for obvious reasons (i.e., they ""really"" are different sports), the disparity between the soccer load (due to its rules) and the others is enormous. It could be considered as ""villain"", the current rule of substitutions (regular and COVID-19 alteration). For example, from all players available in a match (soccer: 11 playing and 12 on the bench), the soccer coach can use only 13% or 21.7% (three players according to the regular rule and five during COVID- 19) against 100% in the other sports (Table 1) . Besides, in all other sports here investigated, a replaced player can play again. A long time ago, a study compared the epidemiology of injuries between soccer and handball concluding that a modification in soccer rules concerning substitutions was a must [39] . The author showed that 80% of the soccer players had to wait on the field despite an injury because all the substitutions had already been done, probably worsening the injury [39] . If, in 1984, it already was nonsensical, nowadays we cannot find an adjective to mention, since soccer matches are now much more demanding [1, 4, 6] , and the number of games per season probably also. Unlimited substitutions potentially would reduce the injury risk during a soccer match/season, which can improve team performance since an 11-year follow-up of the UEFA Champions League concluded that injuries affect team performance negatively in soccer [40] . Recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic, two more substitutions per match were allowed (up to five total) in soccer. The contradiction is that the reason is to ""protect"" the physical integrity of the players [22] . Why not release the substitutions regularly, if the reason is to prevent injuries? In the same way that coaches change the rules during small-sided games (e.g., different number of players, smaller area per player) during training to target specific effects [41] , why not change the substitution rule in elite official matches to obtain the benefits?Beside the substitution limitations, elite soccer is the only sport (here investigated) which does not allow the substituted player to return to the same match, has no time-out (i.e., no chance for brief recovery), and has the offside rule (which obligates the players to move back and forth). Such conditions require even more physical effort from elite soccer players. In this sense, it is interesting to note that the time load would be reduced by~40% if soccer could use all players available (Table 1 , Q). In our data, we performed simulations to equate soccer to other sports by increasing the court dimensions ( Table 2 , Figures 1 and 2) . It is relevant to realize the huge changes that are necessary to have similar conditions. For instance, it does not make sense a basketball match ""1 vs. 1"" (Figure 1) , or a soccer match with 76 vs. 76 players on the field (Figure 2) .Our data showed that basketball has the highest number of matches during a season, while soccer and futsal are similar, and handball has the lowest number of matches per season (Table 3) . Although soccer has fewer matches per season than basketball, when we investigated the ratio of matches and time load exposure, soccer shows around a two-fold greater time played (matches and season) than the other sports ( Figure 3C ,D). Even assuming together (i.e., futsal plus basketball plus handball) the soccer relative load time is higher ( Figure 3D ). When the COVID-19 changes in substitutions is considered, the scenario is better, but still, soccer alone is most demanding (i.e., higher time load per season). However, when allowing unlimited substitutions in soccer (simulation), then, soccer would have lower load time per season than the other three team sports ""together"" ( Figure 3D ). Therefore, it seems crucial to increase the number of substitutions in elite soccer, beyond the COVID-19 changes. The same reasoning would apply to the dimension of each team sport ( Figure 3A,B) . Although the field area would not be equal, the increment on soccer substitutions would make elite soccer less physically stressful.It has been shown that soccer promotes higher metabolic demands [1] , and causes greater inflammatory responses and muscle damage, compared with handball, basketball and volleyball [4] . Lastly, but not least, beside the higher overall physical demand from elite soccer, especially on the lower limbs (to run, sprint, jump), all the technical skills are performed (e.g., passes) by the ""same"" lower limbs. Although the lower limbs are fully in demand (e.g., runs, sprints, accelerations, decelerations) during a basketball or handball game, they may not kick the ball. Soccer-induced fatigue worsens the quality of skills such as passing and shooting [42] , which are decisive for soccer. Indeed, lower extremities are more injured in soccer [43] . Those facts are additional points to suggest unlimited substitutions during elite soccer games (permanently) as a strategy to improve recovery, prevent injuries, and improve performance.One limitation of the current study is that it is difficult to compare different sports, since they are naturally different. We also cannot confirm that all players participate in all the matches during a season. However, the same might happen for other sports too. Thus, such limitations do not obscure our conclusions. Although the increment in substitutions might be an interesting strategy to mitigate the high overall fatigue from elite soccer, we acknowledge that many substitutions during a game may influence a team's tactics. Therefore, the coaches should handle it to take advantage of this possibility. Another potential limitation of the current study is that we did not consider the surfaces. The playing surfaces of the field (soccer) and courts (futsal, basketball, and handball) of these sports are different and may influence the physical demands.We conclude that elite soccer has remarkably higher overall rule-induced physical demands than futsal, basketball, and handball, even acknowledging the change in substitutions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a practical application, allowing the increase of elite soccer substitutions permanently (e.g., unlimited) across the game is a simple strategy to improve recovery and to mitigate the enormous overall soccer demands. Since soccer injury rate is much higher during matches (vs. training sessions [21] ), this rule change may help to face congested schedules and benefit injury prevention.Supplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/19/7008/s1, Table S1 : Top four teams to obtain the number of games per season (2018-2019), international, men, elite of each sport.

To encourage adoption of these behaviors, calls have been issued for governments and health agencies to disseminate timely, accurate, and science-based information to the public, assuming this will result in behavioral change [21] [22] [23] .Effectively changing human behavior, however, often requires going beyond providing information [24] [25] [26] . Adoption of preventive measures, particularly in the context of infectious disease, is largely determined by KAPs [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . In this study, we explored the understanding of COVID-19 by the Ecuadorian public, in order to inform the design of effective prevention and control strategies in the context of the current pandemic.All data for this study were collected online from April 8 to 15, 2020. We used a snowball and referral methodology comprised of three parts. Initially, an invitation was emailed to individuals within the author's personal networks, requesting they forward the message to other people who might be interested. Second, we leveraged social media with a Facebook post boosted through advertising with a link to the survey. Finally, we forwarded the invitation through WhatsApp to the authors' personal networks with an invitation to share it forward. Ecuadorians aged 18 or greater, interested in participating, were asked to click the link to an online description of the study hosted on a Qualtrics platform.Participants were informed that the study was completely anonymous and participation voluntary. After confirming voluntary participation and completing two screening items designed to confirm their age and nationality, participants were directed to the questionnaire.The KAP questionnaire employed in this study was based on a previous one developed by Zhong and colleagues in Hubei province, People's Republic of China [32] . Zhong et al.'s questionnaire was translated into Spanish, adapted to the Ecuadorian context, and updated for recommended prevention practices. The first author, an Anglophone researcher, reviewed the English-version constructs, anchored their conceptual expressions in Spanish and translated the instrument. The fourth author, a Hispanophone researcher reviewed the Spanish-version and made minor edits. The questionnaire was then sent to two additional Hispanophone researchers, one informed of the research purpose and the other not, to account for linguistic and conceptual equivalences. The first author then synthesized the translations in reference to their equivalence to the English questionnaire.The first part of the questionnaire consisted of demographic variables. These included age group (18-29, 30-49, or 50 +, following Zhong et al.'s groupings), gender, marital status, education, occupation, and place of current residence (the three cities in Ecuador, an open-ended option to name another large city, or living outside of a city).The second part of the questionnaire consisted of KAP items. Following Zhong et al., the knowledge component had 12 questions: 4 discussing the clinical presentation of COVID-19, 3 regarding transmission pathways, and 5 regarding prevention and control. Participants could answer ""true"", ""false"", or ""do not know."" The term ""COVID-19 virus"" (as opposed to the more technical SARS-CoV-2) was employed, following Zhong et al., because it is more easily understood by non-specialists. Each correct answer was assigned 1 point; incorrect answers or unknown answers were assigned 0 points. A participant could receive a total knowledge score ranging from 0 to 12; higher scores indicate better knowledge of COVID-19.Additionally, following Zhong et al. attitudes towards COVID-19 were measured by 2 questions. The first question assessed agreement or disagreement on whether COVID-19 would ultimately be controlled. The second question assessed confidence in Ecuador's ability to win the battle against COVID-19.Finally, practices were assessed using 3 items regarding behaviors. In addition to Zhong et al.'s item asking participants to report whether they had gone to crowded places and whether they wore a face mask when outside their home during the week before taking the survey, we also assessed whether participants reported washing their hands each time they returned home or were in contact with another person. In addition to Zhong's assessment, if a participant indicated that they had ventured out of their home in the week before taking the survey, they were also requested to specify how many times they had done it, the reason, and whether they maintained a distance of at least 2 m from other people while out.Frequencies of correct answers and various attitudes and practices were described (see Table 1 ). Independent-samples t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Chi-Square tests, as appropriate, were used to compare members of different demographic grouping's knowledge scores, attitudes, and self-reported practices. We used binary logistic regression analyses to identify demographic factors associated with each attitude and practice. Factors were selected with an enter method to avoid both inflationary and deflationary effects. Unstandardized regression coefficients (β) and odds ratios (ORs), respectively, and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the associations between demographic variables and KAP. Since only some of the individuals reported leaving their homes during the week before the survey, the follow-up questions were applied only to this subset of the study population, and the resulting data did not meet assumptions for regression Therefore, we only report frequencies for this subset. All data analyses were conducted with SPSS version 26.0. The statistical significance level was set at p < 0.05.A total of 2491 individuals consented to participate in the survey. Participants who reported either being under 18 years of age (n = 37) or not being Ecuadorian (n = 55) on the screening questions were excluded, and no further data were recorded for them. After removing participants who skipped all substantive questions, 2399 individuals were retained. This final sample was majority female (1491, 62.5%). About half of the participants (1197, 49.9%) were between 30 and 49 years of age, married (1106, 46.1%), and college educated (1227, 51.1%). Participants represented all labor sectors and nearly all major population centers in Ecuador. A large proportion of participants (1091, 45.9%) were from the national capital, Quito. Full demographic characteristics are shown in Table 2 .The correct answer rates for the 12 questions on the COVID-19 knowledge questionnaire ranged from very low (with only 13.8% answering correctly that zoonotic transmission is not a major pathway) to near universal knowledge (with 98.6% answering correctly that isolating positive cases and avoiding crowded places each are appropriate responses to COVID-19). Table 1 reports correct answer rates for each item. The mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 9.88 (SD 1.46, range 0-12), suggesting a moderate to high rate of knowledge. Knowledge scores significantly differed among educational levels, with individuals who had only completed elementary education scoring significantly lower than all other education levels, and individuals who held a master's degree or higher scoring higher than all other educational levels. Knowledge scores also differed by employment status, with persons who were unemployed, househusbands/ housewives, or manual laborers scoring lowest, and individuals who work in health and medicine scoring highest (see Table 2 ). Gender, age, marital status, and place of residence were not associated with differences in levels of knowledge. Respondents displayed mixed opinions regarding whether COVID-19 will be successfully controlled. Almost one-half of the participants (n = 1134; 47.5%) agreed that COVID-19 will eventually be successfully controlled, while about one-fifth (n = 504; 21.1%) disagreed. The remainder (n = 750; 31.4%) stated that they did not know. Respondent's attitudes toward final success differed significantly by all demographic variables (see Table 3 ). Overall, the binary logistic regression model successfully classified 69.9% of cases and explained about 9% of all variance in attitudes to toward final successful control of COVID-19 (Nagelkerke R2 = 0.088; ""Don't Know"" excluded). Binary logistic regression revealed that women were less likely to predict successful control than men were (OR 0.70; (95% CI 0.56, 0.90) p < 0.01). Additionally, older participants were more likely to believe successful control will eventually be attained (oldest group as compared to younger groups, OR 1.42 (95% CI 1.03, 1.96, p < 0.05). Participants holding Bachelor's or Master's degrees were more optimistic as compared to those with less schooling (OR 1.50 (95% CI 0.31, 0.79), p < 0.01 and OR 1.27 (95% CI 057, 0.95), p < 0.05, respectively). Participants who predicted unsuccessful control displayed lower levels of knowledge than those who predicted successful final control (OR 0.90 (95% CI 0.83, 0.99), p < 0.05). Although preliminary Chi-square analyses indicated significant differences by occupation type, place of residence and marital status, they did not emerge as significant predictors in the regression model. Similar to their view regarding the global situation, participants reported mixed opinion as to whether Ecuador will successfully control COVID-19. About two-thirds of participants (n = 1510; 63.5%) were confident that Ecuador would succeed, while the remainder disagreed (n = 868; 36.5%). Respondent's attitudes toward Ecuador's success differed significantly by several demographic variables: gender, age, marital status, city of residence, as well as knowledge (see Table 3 ). Overall, the binary logistic regression model successfully classified 64.0% of cases and explained about 8% of all variance in attitudes to toward Ecuador's winning the battle against COVID-19 (Nagelkerke R2 = 0.077). Binary logistic regression revealed that, as participants were older, they were more likely to believe successful control will eventually be attained (middle group as compared to youngest, OR 2.73 (95% CI 1.94, 3.85), p < 0.01; oldest group as compared to younger groups, OR 2.03 (95% CI 1.56, 2.64), p < 0.01).Divorced persons were more optimistic as compared to all other groups (OR 5.40 (95% CI 1.12, 25.92); p < 0.05). Although preliminary t-test analysis indicates significant differences by knowledge, and although Chi-square analyses indicated significant differences by place of residence and gender, they did not emerge as significant predictors in the regression model.In the realm of practices, participants overwhelmingly stated that they followed approved practices. Most participants (n = 2122; 88.7%) stated that they have not gone to a crowded place in the prior week. Respondent's self-report that they had avoided crowded places differed significantly by gender, age grouping, marital status, and place of residence (see Table 4 ). Overall, the binary logistic regression model successfully classified 88.7% of cases and explained about 9% of all variance in approaching or avoiding crowded places (Nagelkerke R2 = 0.089). Binary logistic regression revealed that men were less likely to have avoided crowded places than women (OR 0.62 (95% CI 0.47, 0.82); p < 0.01). Furthermore, as participants were younger, they were less likely to have avoided going to crowded places (youngest group as compared to middle group, OR 0.41 (95% CI 0.23, 0.73), p < 0.01; younger groups as compared to oldest groups, OR 0.70 (95% CI 0.19, 0.48), p < 0.01). Persons who were single-never married were more likely to have gone to crowded places than all other groups (OR 1.47 (95% CI 0.07, 4.21), p < 0.05). Residents of some cities, specifically Guayaquil (OR 0.56 (95% CI 0.23, 0.56), p < 0.01), Machala (OR 0.28 (95% CI 0.12, 0.86), p < 0.05), Manta (OR 0.34 (95% CI 0.13, 0.78), p < 0.05), or Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas (OR 0.27 (95% CI 0.09, 0.81), p < 0.05) were less likely to have avoided crowded places. Although preliminary t-test analyses indicated significant differences by knowledge and chi-square analyses by occupation type, they did not emerge as significant predictors in the regression model.Similarly, most participants (n = 2212; 93.2%) reported that they had worn a face mask when they had left the home in the prior week. Respondent's self-report that they had worn a mask whenever they leave the home differed significantly by all demographic variables except marital status (see Table 4 ). Overall, the binary logistic regression model successfully classified 93.4% of cases and explained about 9% of all variance in mask wearing (Nagelkerke R2 = 0.087). Binary logistic regression revealed that women were less likely to report wearing masks than men (OR 0.56 (95% CI 0.37, 0.83); p < 0.01). City dwellers were more likely to wear masks compared participants who reported living outside of big cities (OR 2.65 (95% CI 1.47, 4.76), p < 0.01). Although preliminary Chi-square analyses indicated significant differences by educational level, occupation type, marital status, and t-test indicated significant differences by knowledge they did not emerge as significant predictors in the regression model. Nearly all participants (n = 2300; 96.6%) stated that they had washed their hands for at least 20 s every time after returning home or touching another person. Respondent's self-reports of handwashing significantly by age, marital status, and knowledge (see Table 4 ). Overall, the binary logistic regression model successfully classified 69.9% of cases and explained about 8% of all variance in handwashing (Nagelkerke R2 = 0.075). Binary logistic regression revealed that persons who were unemployed were most likely to report always handwashing as compared to all other employment groups (OR 4.09 (95% CI 1.41, 16.35), p < 0.05). Persons who reported not always handwashing held lower levels of knowledge than those who reported always handwashing (OR 0.81 (95% CI 0.71, 0.93), p < 0.01). Although preliminary Chi-square analyses indicated significant differences by age and marital status, they did not emerge as significant predictors in the regression model.Most participants stated that they had not left home in the prior week (n = 2130; 88.8%). Among those (n = 269) who had left the home the week before the survey, a majority had only left the home once (n = 151; 56.1%). Seventy-eight (29.0%) had left home two or three times, and only 40 people (14.9% of those who had left home, 1.7% of the total sample) had been outside their home four or more times. Most people who had left the home reported maintaining a distance of at least two meters from other people (n = 211; 78.4%), with the rest (n = 58; 21.6%) admitting that they had not maintained distance. Reasons reported for leaving home included performing essential work (n = 69; 25.6%), purchasing food for self, family, or pets (n = 190; 70.6%), purchasing medicine (n = 62; 23.0%), or visits to physicians or veterinarians (n = 18; 6.7%). Indeed, of the 269 people who had ventured outside, only one had left for a reason other than essential travel; he reported leaving home to purchase marijuana.This study was conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak in Ecuador. These findings outline areas that should be addressed by the Ministry of Health in Ecuador, the private sector, and non-profit actors to help prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.In comparison to Zhong et al.'s Chinese sample, the Ecuadorian participants reported a substantially lower rate of knowledge about COVID-19. Among the Chinese sample, participants scored 90% on the knowledge questionnaire; however, Ecuadorian participants answered 82.3% questions correctly. Transformed into school marking terms, their grades were a letter grade lower, indicating substantial room to educate the population about SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Our data indicate that four items should be specifically addressed. First, there is substantial misconception about potential zoonotic transmission that should be countered. Second, the role of medical masks in limiting the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 could be promoted. Third, differences between symptoms of the common cold and of COVID-19 are often confused in our sample. Finally, the public may wish to be aware of the populations that are most vulnerable to COVID-19-older people, people with chronic illnesses, and persons who are obese-so that they may know who in their social networks are most at risk.Promoting improved understanding of COVID-19 may also help promote confidence that COVID-19 will eventually be controlled. Less than half of the participants were confident that COVID-19 would ultimately be controlled, and only two-thirds had confidence in Ecuador's ability to defeat COVID-19. This stands in sharp contrast with Zhong et al.'s findings where over 90% of the Chinese participants believed that COVID-19 would eventually be controlled and over 97% believed that China would be successful in its battle against COVID-19. Ecuadorians, at least in this sample, are much less optimistic. Women, older people, and more highly educated people are the least optimistic about succeeding against COVID-19, representing primary targets for persuasion. This persuasion will not be a problem of simple education. Our data indicate that people with higher knowledge of COVID-19 had fewer ""I don't know"" answers about eventual success, but they were not more likely to believe in eventual success. Moreover, greater knowledge had no association with optimism about Ecuador's ability to win this battle. These findings indicate that greater knowledge is insufficient to change attitudes by itself. Attitudes are a primary motivator for action on threats to health [25, 33, 34] . That is, when people believe that success is likely, they are also more likely to act. Therefore, it is essential that future studies determine why people are not optimistic about the world's and Ecuador's ability to overcome COVID-19. Reasons for this could include distrust in governing institutions, pessimism about science and medicine, or other potential explanations.Overall, participants in this study reported adopting the practices recommended to limit the spread of COVID-19. A supermajority of the participants reported avoiding crowded places, always wearing a mask when outside the home, and washing their hands for at least 20 s upon returning home. When leaving their home, usually once a week, participants reported having done so for essential purposes, ‡ For A1, F value for ANOVA, t value for t-test for A2 significant at p < 0.01 and maintaining the recommended 2-m distance from other people. Men, young people, single people, and unemployed people engaged in the riskiest behaviors. Even among these populations, however, reported compliance with recommended behaviors was extremely high. Importantly, knowledge was not a predictor for avoiding crowded places or wearing a mask.Although handwashing was associated with knowledge, it only explained part of the variance. Rather than repeating information about the importance of these practices, it may be more important to look at why men, younger people, single people, and unemployed people are less likely to adopt the recommended behaviors. Expected gender roles may be encouraging men to take more risks of going out in public. Younger people may believe they are less vulnerable to COVID-19 or its complications. Single persons may have no one else in the household to purchase food and medicine or have less access to protective resources, and unemployed persons may be unable to afford to stockpile food or to purchase face masks. Additionally, many unemployed individuals in Ecuador (46.3% in 2018) subsist through informally selling products or services in the streets [35] . Certainly, the informal sector is larger in Guayaquil (40.3%), the most populous city in Ecuador, than in Quito (20.8%). These people depend on their daily earnings to survive and, therefore, may be forced to leave their homes on a daily basis. Therefore, public messaging campaigns should be accompanied by even stronger efforts to provide goods and resources to the most in need segments of the population to encourage these groups to adopt the actions recommended to prevent the spread of COVID-19.Although this study is the first, to our knowledge, to examine knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to COVID-19 in a South American population, there are some limitations. In our sample women, people living in urban areas and people with high levels of education were overrepresented. Greater participation of individuals from rural areas or with lower educational levels could have reduced the measured knowledge about COVID-19. Therefore, KAP towards COVID-19 among these populations deserves attention. However, in the present context, face-to-face methods of recruitment would place both researchers and participants at greater risk of COVID-19. Therefore, studies like this one should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks of face to face data collection methods.In summary, our findings indicate that people in Ecuador are likely to have moderate to high levels of knowledge related to COVID-19 and are likely to practice recommended behaviors to prevent the further spread of COVID-19. The greatest area for improvement is regarding pessimistic attitudes on the eventual control of COVID-19, which suggests that health education and outreach should not only focus on knowledge and prevention practices, but should also promote optimistic attitudes.",Ecuador,abstract,2020-09-11,9
6728222327ff2f144506590daf0f0127bca12929,Comunicación breve Recomendaciones para la reapertura de servicios de cirugía electiva durante la pandemia por SARS-CoV-2,"Los pacientes en quienes la cirugía se considera ""electiva"" son aquellos con problemas agudos y crónicos cuya intervención quirúrgica ciertamente puede retrasarse sin un daño significativo para el paciente o el resultado final. Aunque se puede argumentar la necesidad de cirugía en algunas personas debido al dolor o al deterioro funcional, el principio determinante es que retrasar el tratamiento no alterará significativamente el resultado final (1, 2) . La pandemia ocasionada por el SARS-CoV-2 y la enfermedad resultante (coronavirus 2019 disease, COVID-19), llevó en todo el mundo a cambios significativos en la forma de prestar los servicios de salud, incluida la actividad quirúrgica. La situación epidemiológica de la pandemia en cada país es diferente, y cada semana se modifica la incidencia de casos, muertes y pacientes recuperados (3) . En algunos países se está alcanzando el denominado pico epidemiológico de la pandemia, mientras que en otros ya se vislumbra un descenso en el número de casos. Dado lo anterior y las recientes directrices gubernamentales orientadas al reinicio por fases de las actividades comerciales y económicas denominadas esenciales (4), desde la prestación de servicios de salud se debe buscar un equilibrio entre las necesidades económicas y de salud pública frente al reto de reiniciar los procedimientos que se consideran electivos de una manera que no se afecten los sistemas de salud en tiempos de pandemia pero que tampoco se afecte la salud y la calidad de vida de las personas que tienen indicación de un procedimiento quirúrgico (5) .Las diferentes proyecciones muestran que el SARS-CoV2 continuará afectando a las poblaciones por un periodo largo aún no establecido. Según modelos matemáticos, los brotes recurrentes pueden llegar hasta el año 2024 o 2025; se menciona incluso que las medidas de aislamiento físico se deberían prolongar por lo menos hasta 2022 (6) . Muchos procedimientos de cirugía electiva fueron suspendidos al inicio de la pandemia acatando las recomendaciones de protección individual y el distanciamiento físico para proteger a niños, adultos mayores y personas con comorbilidades definidas como de riesgo para la COVID-19. También se acataron en gran medida para proteger y preparar la respuesta de los servicios de salud.

Tomar la decisión de programar nuevamente una cirugía electiva obedece a múltiples propósitos; sin embargo, hay varios lineamientos que deben ser tenidos en cuenta para lograr un proceso exitoso mientras continúe la pandemia (6) . En este artículo se sintetizan las recomendaciones basadas en la mejor evidencia disponible hasta el momento y las lecciones aprendidas durante el proceso de reapertura de servicios de cirugía electiva de alta complejidad, cirugía ambulatoria mayor y cirugía de corta estancia instaurados en instituciones de mediana y alta complejidad en Colombia tomando como marco de referencia el riesgo individual de infección por COVID-19, la disminución de casos en el área geográfica de influencia de cada hospital y el riesgo de que pueda empeorar la salud de los pacientes que requieren una cirugía electiva si se demora la intervención.• Tanto la apertura como la decisión de suspender la programación de procedimientos de cirugía electiva se regirán por decisiones informadas con datos derivados del monitoreo diario institucional, contrastados y acatando las alertas dadas por las autoridades locales y nacionales. Para que dicho monitoreo sea efectivo y eficiente, cada institución conformará un centro de mando que puede ser denominado Comité Multidisciplinario de Quirófanos (CMQ); este es un comité asesor de las decisiones que con responsabilidad ejecutiva recaen tanto en el director científico como en la gerencia de cada clínica u hospital durante la pandemia. Se recomienda que el CMQ incluya líderes de áreas quirúrgicas, anestesia y cuidado crítico, infectología, epidemiología, salud mental, bioética y asociación de pacientes. • Las funciones de los CMQ son la recolección, el monitoreo, el análisis y la evaluación diaria del avance y comportamiento del plan de reactivación de cirugía electiva, incluida la decisión de programar y cancelar procedimientos. También se encargará de dar a conocer y promover el cumplimiento de las normas e informar las dudas o situaciones que se presenten durante el proceso de reactivación facilitando su gestión y resolución. • Es prioritario que el CMQ incluya las cifras de disponibilidad de camas en la unidad de cuidados intensivos (UCI) dado que con el incremento proyectado en el número de casos es el indicador más fiable de la capacidad de respuesta institucional y de la red hospitalaria. Aunque la oferta de camas UCI se ha incrementado por los planes de expansión en clínicas y hospitales, también es necesario contrastarla con el indicador de personal idóneo para su operación. • Considerar siempre la ocurrencia de casos de emergencia quirúrgica y prever la capacidad de las instalaciones para su atención. • La programación de una cirugía estará condicionada a la evaluación y el seguimiento del recurso hospitalario, al comportamiento de la pandemia y a las decisiones de tipo administrativo y de salud pública que se generen a partir de las autoridades competentes (Figura 1). Debe determinarse el número de profesionales de los equipos quirúrgicos y de apoyo sospechosos o confirmados para la COVID-19 y el número de pacientes llevados a cirugía electiva que durante el posquirúrgico inmediato de 14 días son reportados como positivos para la COVID-19. En ambos casos, se requiere realizar de inmediato la investigación de campo para identificar los contactos efectivos en la institución y apoyarse con las autoridades de salud y de aseguramiento en la búsqueda activa, el tamizaje, la atención y la protección de contactos ambulatorios. • Cada institución debe censar y conocer las comorbilidades y la edad de los miembros del equipo quirúrgico con el fin de estratificar sus riesgos y establecer las medidas de protección apropiadas en forma individual. • Instaurar una rotación del personal de quirófanos y áreas de apoyo para evitar la sobreexposición. • Establecer procesos de seguimiento y apoyo para el personal de salud definiendo estrategias de detección de conductas emocionales atípicas que permitan hallar alteraciones del estado emocional, fatiga y riesgo de burnout. • Flexibilizar los horarios del personal con afectación emocional o con familiares contagiados (4,7-9).• Evaluar las listas de pacientes cancelados y priorizar su atención según su patología quirúrgica de base (se recomienda el uso de la escala de estratificación MeNTS-Medically Necessary Time Sensitive) (10) . • Organizar bloques quirúrgicos que puedan realizarse con anestesia local o regional para reducir la generación de aerosoles. • Los procedimientos diagnósticos ordenados deben realizarse según se consideren domiciliarios o ambulatorios cumpliendo medidas de bioseguridad. • En todo paciente con indicación de cirugía electiva, documentar de manera estricta los antecedentes de comorbilidades como inmunosupresión, VIH, cáncer, quimioterapia, diabetes, hipertensión, obesidad, falla renal, hipotiroidismo, malnutrición, uso de corticoides, enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva crónica/asma y tabaquismo; estos pacientes tienen mayor riesgo de ingreso a la UCI y de morbimortalidad en caso de resultar afectados por la COVID-19. • Diseñar y diligenciar a todo paciente programado para cirugía electiva un consentimiento informado sobre el riesgo de COVID-19. • No se recomienda la formulación de ""dispensa laboral"" para dar cumplimiento a medidas de autocuidado previo a la cirugía. • El paciente y su familiar deben conocer con la debida anticipación la ruta de acceso y las estaciones de control necesarias para lograr un rápido ingreso al quirófano y los controles administrativos. • Inhabilitar las salas de espera; de esta manera la visita al paciente se concentrará en su habitación y no en áreas comunes (solamente debe permitirse un acompañante). • Velar por el adecuado estado de los equipos que minimicen la exposición al gas o el humo (neumoinsufladores con filtros) o pantallas que mejoren la visión en presencia de humo para los equipos quirúrgicos. • Después de la aplicación de la escala MeNTS y en presencia de un puntaje ≥55 puntos, reconsiderar la realización del procedimiento quirúrgico. Debe destacarse que la aplicación de la escala no reemplaza el juicio clínico del cirujano; más bien supone una evaluación detallada de cada paciente que permita la toma de decisiones conjunta con este, quien debe tener muy claros los riesgos particulares de ser operado durante la pandemia y así debe quedar registrado en la historia clínica. • En casos particulares será útil citar una junta de varios especialistas para la discusión del caso, y en situaciones de mayor complejidad se debe acudir a la instancia de un comité de ética (7, 8, 10) .El CMQ definirá y modificará la distribución de las jornadas quirúrgicas con el objeto de establecer la programación de los • Restringir el uso del vestido de calle y de calzado dentro de la institución hospitalaria, donde debe ser utilizado el vestido y calzado de dotación, y evitar el uso de gorros extrainstitucionales. • Minimizar el uso de dispositivos que generen humo y aerosoles. • Asegurar en instituciones con cirugía ambulatoria mayor un plan de atención quirúrgica para la reanudación de las actividades, que garantice un adecuado proceso de evaluación y de selección de pacientes que incluya, como mínimo, cuestionarios para la evaluación de signos y síntomas relacionados a la infección por COVID-19. • Poner en marcha mecanismos o recordatorios 72 o 48 horas antes para disminuir el abandono de la cita planeada para la cirugía (2, 7, 9, 10) .• Buscar la presencia de fiebre, odinofagia, anosmia, disgeusia, tos seca, disnea, adinamia o fatiga, síntomas gastrointestinales (náusea, diarrea), antecedente de confinamiento, o contacto en los últimos 14 días con paciente sospechoso/ confirmado COVID-19. La presencia de cualquiera de los síntomas o contactos mencionados constituyen un tamizaje clínico [+] y se debe cancelar la programación del procedimiento, recomendar aislamiento físico por 14 días, solicitar estudios de PCR-TR y, de acuerdo con el resultado de la pruebas y la resolución de los síntomas, evaluar al paciente una vez se encuentre completamente recuperado para programar su cirugía. • Frente a un tamizaje clínico [-] y si la institución cuenta con pruebas rápidas IgG e IgM se recomienda realizarlas 24 • Vigilar y exigir el cumplimiento de las listas de seguridad para el paciente. • Respecto del abordaje quirúrgico (cirugía abierta o laparoscópica), el cirujano elegirá la vía de acuerdo con su pericia. No existe evidencia que permita recomendar el no hacer cirugía laparoscópica. Debe monitorizarse la información con relación a los dispositivos de energía avanzada, que a la fecha no es concluyente. • En la cirugía laparoscópica se recomienda el uso de un circuito cerrado de eliminación del gas y del humo para disminuir el riesgo de exposición. • Emplear presiones bajas de neumoperitoneo, para lo cual es indispensable una adecuada relajación del paciente. • Preferir trocares desechables, que brindan un sello más hermético. • Realizar incisiones pequeñas ajustadas al trocar.• Manipular cuidadosamente los instrumentos. • En instituciones que cuenten con médicos residentes de especialidades quirúrgicas será responsabilidad del cirujano tratante la delegación de funciones, y decidir el momento y caso que puede asumir el residente en entrenamiento cumpliendo las mismas recomendaciones de cuidado de todo el equipo quirúrgico. • Extraer trocares y especímenes quirúrgicos después de evacuar por completo el neumoperitoneo. • Se recomienda el cierre de las heridas quirúrgicas con material que no requiera ser retirado (como cianoacrilato o suturas monofilamento absorbibles a corto plazo), así como evitar el uso de drenes o mechas, lo cual facilitará el control no presencial del paciente (7, 8) .• Se recomienda que el control posquirúrgico se realice de manera virtual cuando sea posible en los tiempos que determinen los protocolos institucionales. • Cada institución generará instructivos para los pacientes, quienes deben mantener un aislamiento preventivo por dos semanas en el período posquirúrgico (2, 5, 7) .• Cada institución deberá realizar un seguimiento de los pacientes de cirugía electiva hasta 14 días posteriores a la fecha de la cirugía, enfatizando la posibilidad de detectar pacientes que se contagiaron con SARS-CoV-2. • Garantizar un adecuado seguimiento posoperatorio, incluido un programa de atención domiciliaria en los casos que se requiera y que se disponga del servicio, o coordinar dicho seguimiento con las autoridades locales de salud (8, 9) .• Durante la pandemia, salvo atenuantes mayores, el CMQ realizará sus actividades de forma diaria; debe adoptar medidas suficientes que garanticen la continuidad de su funcionamiento (2, 8) . • La revisión constante de literatura científica bajo los preceptos de la medicina basada en evidencia es una estartegia fundamental para informar la toma de decisiones durante la pandemia.casos que deben realizarse teniendo en cuenta la prioridad, la complejidad quirúrgica y el estado del paciente, considerando asimismo la fase de la pandemia o el escenario en que se encuentre la institución. El CMQ definirá los horarios teniendo en cuenta la recomendación de prolongar los tiempos de programación en salas, por lo cual se puede considerar la extensión del tiempo de funcionamiento durante las horas de la noche y los fines de semana para responder a la demanda de cirugía electiva. Se recomienda mantener una programación escalonada para evitar aglomeraciones (7).• Toda institución deberá adherirse a las definiciones establecidas por las autoridades nacionales sobre la calidad, la disposición y el uso adecuado de los EPP. Entender los mecanismos de transmisión del virus es muy importante, tanto para el manejo de los pacientes como para el adecuado uso de los EPP. • Evaluar a corto y mediano plazo la disponibilidad de EPP tomando en cuenta el aumento exponencial de casos y la posibilidad de una segunda ola de la pandemia, así como escenarios de desabastecimiento del mercado. • La institución debe garantizar la disponibilidad y protocolizar el uso, retiro y destino final de todos los EPP, tanto para la protección contra gotas y aerosoles como los necesarios para disminuir el riesgo por contacto. Lo anterior es una medida complementaria al mantenimiento de conductas individuales y colectivas de autoprotección (cultura de seguridad y calidad) sumada a los protocolos de limpieza e higiene exhaustivos de equipos e infraestructura. • Incentivar el reporte de signos y síntomas, así como de la ocurrencia de contactos estrechos no protegidos con pacientes confirmados o sospechosos para la COVID-19 (8, 9) .• Realizar la cirugía electiva de pacientes sin COVID-19 en circuitos completamente diferenciados desde el ingreso a las clínicas hasta el egreso, a través de habitaciones en pisos, camas en UCI, unidades de cuidado posanestesia o cuidados intermedios diferenciadas físicamente y quirófanos preferenciales limpios y seguros. Los quirófanos de urgencias y para pacientes con COVID-19 deben estar claramente definidos. • Determinar según el tipo de salas, el recambio del aire que permita definir el tiempo entre procedimientos y los momentos de circulación en el quirófano. • Establecer protocolos de verificación de equipos y cambio de filtros de los sistemas de ventilación. • Recomendar la disponibilidad de personal de apoyo para circular los diferentes quirófanos, desestimando la entrada y salida continua de la circulante de la sala, disminuyendo así la turbulencia del quirófano y la posibilidad de contaminación cruzada. • Definir los protocolos quirúrgicos y anestésicos antes de iniciarse el procedimiento para disminuir la rotación de elementos en la sala. • Definir con el servicio de patología las normas de embalaje y transporte de las muestras, y suprimir el uso de biopsias por congelación durante la pandemia.Contribución de los autores.

bf25396f71bb6bf4e41a6851822dce75cdd07aef,Case Report: Recurrent Clinical Symptoms of COVID-19 in Healthcare Professionals: A Series of Cases from Brazil,"The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and quickly spread throughout the world, 1,2 with Brazil being one of the countries with the highest number of cases. 3 Most cases evolve in a benign and self-limited manner. There is little definitive evidence for the development of immune protection after natural infection. In February 2020, four confirmed patients were reported, who were discharged after two negative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR tests, but reverted to being positive by RT-PCR 5-13 days after hospital discharge. 4 Soon after that, several groups reported a similar phenomenon, which has received variable designations in the literature (recurrence, possible human reactivation, or reinfection by SARS-CoV-2). 1, [5] [6] [7] A distinct situation seems to happen when COVID-19 relapses with clinical manifestations of the disease associated with viral RNA detection on molecular testing, characterizing a condition compatible with the recurrence of COVID-19. A retrospective cohort of 55 individuals identified five cases (9%) that required readmission because of symptom recurrence between 4 and 17 days after discharge. Clinical progression was benign, with no differences observed from the acute phase. 8 More recently, a case series was described involving 11 individuals in a similar situation, with reappearance of symptoms between 24 and 49 days after the beginning of the first episode. In this series, three deaths were reported, and viral detection was possible in cultured samples from one of the two recurrent cases tested. 9 However, so far, there is no consensus on the possibility of recurrence, much less the distinction between possible human reactivation and reinfection by SARS-CoV-2. [5] [6] [7] In Ceará, northeastern Brazil, more than 140,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, with more than 7,000 deaths, 10, 11 which has led the health system to collapse. Here, we describe six cases of healthcare professionals who recovered but again presented symptoms consistent with COVID-19, with new positive RT-PCR test results.The cases reported herein presented symptom onset between March 16, 2020 and April 9, 2020. All were health professionals (four medical doctors), five were female, with a median age of 43.5 years, and three had comorbidities ( Table 1 ). The cases presented were officially notified by the state epidemiological surveillance service of Ceará government. After information gathering, all patients agreed with the use of their anonymous medical data.All patients were confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR in naso and/or oropharyngeal swab samples, which were collected between 0 and 11 days after the first symptoms. Among the reported cases, 50% (3) underwent RT-PCR testing in the period between the two symptomatic episodes, with negative results. Only one of the patients underwent serological rapid testing in the same interval, which was also negative in two separate samples. In four cases, serological testing was also performed, but only after the second clinical episode, with negative initial results. Three cases later seroconverted positive by chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay serology, collected on the 11th, the 28th, and the 37th day after the onset of symptoms in the second episode ( Figure 1) .The time elapsed between the onset of symptoms in both episodes ranged from 53 to 70 days (median, 56.5 days). In the first episode, the main symptoms described were fever (4/6), myalgia (3/6), sore throat (3/6), and cough (3/6). Meanwhile, during the second episode, fever (4/6) and weakness (3/6) predominated. Myalgia and diarrhea were reported only in the first episode, but the highest number of symptoms was described during the second episode. In two cases, anosmia was observed in the second episode. Most of the cases progressed without complications, although one individual presented hypoxemia (minimum SatO 2 of 90%) in both episodes, and two, only in the second, one of which required intensive care unit (ICU) admission, progressing with improvement after medication and receiving noninvasive ventilatory support.During the first episode, patient 1 received oseltamivir for 10 days, and in the second, symptomatic medications, azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, were prescribed, in addition to oseltamivir. Patient 2 was treated with symptomatic medication and oseltamivir in the first episode, whereas in the second, only symptomatic medication was prescribed. Patient 3 presented a high-resolution chest tomography (HRCT) with slight scattered and bilateral ground-glass pulmonary opacities, more evident in peripheral regions (less than 50% extension) and was treated with prednisone and azithromycin only in the second episode. Patient 4 required hospitalization only in the second episode, when he used hydroxychloroquine (800 mg on the first day, and then 400 mg/day for another 6 days), azithromycin (500 mg/day) for 5 days, and levofloxacin (750 mg/day) for 7 days. He evolved without improvement, being transferred to the ICU to receive high-flow oxygen therapy. He had HRCT with pulmonary involvement of 50-75% in extension. A schedule was planned for piperacillin-tazobactam (8 days ago) and methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day for 5 days, with progressive reduction) and prophylactic anticoagulation. Patient 6, who exhibited hypoxemia in both episodes, used hydroxychloroquine 400 mg, azithromycin 500 mg for 5 days, and levofloxacin 750 mg from the 6th to the 10th day. On the second visit, the patient was prescribed ivermectin 6 mg (two tablets, 24/24 hours) for 3 days, azithromycin 500 mg/day for 5 days, and prednisone 80 mg/day from the 6th to the 10th day.We report cases with recurrence of symptoms compatible with COVID-19, with positive RT-PCR results, that could represent the occurrence of viral reactivation or reinfection. The interpretation of this phenomenon is subject to questioning because the detection of the viral genome by RT-PCR has persisted in some cases for up to 6 weeks. 6 The long asymptomatic period and characteristics of the symptoms reinforce the possibility of recurrence. However, our data are not sufficient to prove the occurrence of such phenomena, nor to characterize their nature.Despite efforts to produce a vaccine, a licensed one remains unavailable. 12 It is likely that health professionals with COVID-19 will require post-discharge and post-recovery surveillance of signs and symptoms, with retesting for SARS-CoV-2 for those who present recurrent clinical manifestations of the disease. We emphasize the importance of maintaining the use of personal protective equipment and hand hygiene even after curing COVID-19 when returning for assistance. Determining the possibility of reinfection or reactivation of the virus and Time between episodes  53  58  70  54  56  57  Time test: symptom 1  11  11  0  4  0  6  Time test: symptom 2  5  5  5  3  4  3  Adynamia Yes immunological protection after natural infection has important implications for coping with the COVID-19 pandemic in the future.One limitation found in the present investigation was the absence of cultures and sequencing of the virus, which were not possible. After the occurrence of these cases, the local government implemented surveillance by electronic means, with the objective of detecting earlier new suspected cases with this profile. In addition, longitudinal cohort studies will assist in better understanding the prognosis of the disease.",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-04,9

It is known from a systematic review and meta-analysis that, in hospitalizations of patients aged 18 years and older, ICU mortality due to COVID-19 is higher than that normally seen in patients with other viral pneumonias. As the pandemic progressed, reported death rates dropped from more than 50% to close to 40%. There were no significant effects by geographic location. Countries that faced the pandemic later appear to have better dealt with cases, but in order to better understand the mechanisms, it would be necessary to study the admission criteria applied, patient status upon admission and treatments administered in the ICU 4 . Another systematic review carried out on inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 in 12 countries showed that patients in America and Europe were older than those in Asia. In Europe there were more male patients.Comorbidities were more frequent, and mortality was higher in European and American patients than in Asian patients. Despite considerable variations in the reviewed studies due to sample size, disease severity (mild vs. critical illness) and geographic region, the most frequent comorbidities were obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular, lung, chronic kidney and liver diseases, immunosuppression and cancers.In addition, socioeconomic status of the affected population also plays a role in these results.For instance, a study carried out in New York, using a cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 coming from a poor population, identified severe obesity as a risk factor for higher mortality, even after adjusting for other confounding factors 9 .In Brazil, a cross-sectional observational study conducted with hospitalized COVID-19 patients identified a lower likelihood of death in young, female patients with fewer comorbidities, commensurable with what has been observed in other countries. Furthermore, it highlighted a higher risk of death among black and brown populations and in patients hospitalized in the Northern region compared to other regions of the country, which, for the authors, would be a specific manifestation of the disease in the Brazilian population. The authors suggest that the regional effect may be driven by the morbidity profile of patients in regions with lower levels of socioeconomic development 10 .Despite the recognized increase in international and national publications about COVID- 19, there are still few studies that explore the risk factors and characteristics of hospitalizations for COVID-19 in the population considering geographic variations 11 . Therefore, the following question arises: How does the profile of patients and hospitalizations observed in the international literature compare with hospitalizations that occurred in Brazil's public system in different regions of the country? The goal of this paper is to understand the profile of COVID-19 hospital admissions in the Unified Health System (SUS) and to identify associated factors with the occurrence of hospital deaths related to the disease, considering patient characteristics and the care offered, with a focus on regional variations. In this way, we expect to contribute to the improvement of the care provided and to define strategies to face future developments in the pandemic's course until the population has access to an effective vaccine.The SUS Hospital Information System (SIH) was the data source. Although this system presents coverage and quality issues, it is the main source of information on hospital production nationwide. In addition to demographic data (age, sex), it includes diagnostic data, type of admission (elective / emergency) and type of care (surgical / clinical), length of stay (LOS), use of intensive care (ICU), outcome at discharge and the amount reimbursed for the hospitalization.In 2016, it was expanded to accept up to nine secondary diagnoses registrations, potentially allowing a better description of the morbidity and severity case profile. In addition to secondary diagnoses, variables indicating their pre-existence (presence at admission), which are patient attributes; or if they were acquired during the process of care in the hospital, which recognizably are performance and quality of care issues. The only sociodemographic variable available in the SIH dataset is race/color. The data used were extracted from the reduced type (RD) files for each state and Federal District, freely available on the DATASUS portal 12 . It is likely that hospitalizations in the months of interest are underreported due to the specificities of SIH's data transmission process and its main purpose, which is reimbursement.In hospitalizations prior to April, the procedure used was ""03.03.01.019-3 -TREATMENT OF OTHER DISEASES CAUSED BY VIRUSES (ICD-10: B25-B34)"". Given its lack of specificity and relation to a wide range of main diagnoses, it was not considered as an additional inclusion criterion beyond the B34.2, except for a few records containing the B97.2 -Coronavirus, as the cause of classified diseases in other chapters as the main diagnosis.The study focused on the analysis of patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, the care process and contextual variables related to the hospitalization, and their effects on the chances of hospital death.Descriptive and bivariate analyses were performed to characterize the study population and to test the relationships between the independent variables (attributes of the patients, the care process and the hospital, place of residence and geographic location) with the dependent variable 'in-hospital death'. The scope of the information available in the dataset shaped the range of operationalized variables and the scope of the analyses.To account for the correlation among observations occurring in each hospital, resulting from the process of care and case-mix, we used the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with random effects intercept. This model was used to assess the different factors associated (independent variables) with the death of hospitalized COVID-19 patients (response with binary distribution).Thus, the modeling occurred in three stages, with the insertion of different blocks of variables:For the first stage, the case severity profile was based on demographic variables (sex and age) and comorbidities. The variable 'sex' is binary as informed in the SIH, and we considered female as the reference category. Age was treated as a categorical variable (18- widely used in models for predicting death 17 and have previously been applied to Brazilian patients 18 ; the calculation used the ICD-10 code algorithm for each clinical condition developed by Quan et al. 19 . Additionally, we considered whether COVID-19 was designated as a primary (reference category) or secondary diagnosis. In the case of the variable 'race/color', we started out by using the five categories provided by SIH (white, black, brown, yellow and indigenous) and, after examination, we chose to consider the categories black, brown and others, as reference. Race/color is used as a proxy for social vulnerability and inequalities in socioeconomic conditions, health, access, use and effectiveness of care.In the second stage, two variables about the care process were added to the previous model:In the third and last stage of the modeling process, we inserted hierarchical level variables, namely the hospital, the place of residence and the geographical location where the hospitalization occurred. At the hospital level, its legal nature was also considered, and they were categorized as municipal, state and federal public hospital, private for profit and private non-profit. For the place of residence, a variable indicating patient displacement to seek care was created, considering whether the municipality of residence and the location of the hospital were the same (dichotomous variable yes no). Finally, we used categories for each state (including the Federal District) to account for geographic effects in the occurrence of hospitalization; and municipal population size, which, in previous analysis, was more adequate than the municipal human development index (Municipal HDI).The goodness of fit of the different models was tested. Predictive capacity was assessed based on the ""c"" statistic. Data analysis was performed with the SAS statistical package.The selection criteria for hospitalizations yielded 89,405 records, among which 13 corresponded to hospitalizations that started and ended in 2020, before the month of March. Altogether, 21,807 (24.4%) hospitalizations resulted in death.Considering ICU alone, the average LOS was 7.6 (± 6.8) days, with a median of 6 days.The analyses here presented considered the association between the occurrence of hospital death and three ""blocks"" of variables: sociodemographic and clinical attributes of patients; aspects related to the care process; and data from the macro context of the hospital organization and geographic location of the hospital. Tables 1-3 show descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses of these variables, when death occurred or not.In Table 1 , we observe higher hospital mortality for men and an increasing gradient of the odds of dying as age (age group) increases. Among individuals aged 18 to 39 years, 8.5% of hospitalizations resulted in death. For individuals between 70 and 79, 80 and 89 and at least 90 years old, the proportion of hospitalizations that resulted in death increased to 36.0%, 44.5% and 50.8%, respectively.The clinical variables expose low levels of information about secondary diagnoses, resulting in a significant underreporting of clinical conditions relevant to the patients' prognosis.Approximately 78.3% of hospitalizations did not have any secondary diagnoses. Even so, the results indicate a higher occurrence of deaths among patients with greater severity according to the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity indices or patients with diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity, which show a pattern consistent with what was expected. Table 1 also shows a variable created to capture any differences in mortality between patients with COVID-19 as the main diagnosis or as a secondary diagnosis. Hospitalizations with the COVID-19 diagnosis registered in one of the secondary diagnosis corresponded to 3.1% of the sample, and in this case, the bivariate analyses did not show differences regarding the occurrence of death.In Table 2 , the percentage of hospitalizations with less than 24 hours or one day of hospitalization stands out (11.8%), and moreover, the high mortality (32.2%) in this category.About two thirds of the total hospitalizations lasted up to 7 days (29.1%), between 8 and 22 days (3.4%) and 23 days or more (3.4%). Based on the bivariate analyses, there appears to be a greater concentration of deaths in the extreme categories of LOS, with a lower occurrence of deaths (20.0%) among those with LOS between 2 and 7 days. The proportion of deaths among those who used the ICU was high (55.7%) compared to those who did not use it (15.3%).The distribution of hospitalizations by state presents, in a way, a photograph of the period analyzed, in which some states in the Southeastern, Northeastern and Northern regions were most affected by the epidemic. Just under a third (31.8%) of the hospitalizations analyzed occurred in São Paulo, the largest and richest Brazilian state. São Paulo was followed by Rio de Janeiro (11.8%), Pernambuco (9.5%), Ceará (6.9%), Maranhão (6.7%) and Amazonas (5.2%).Among these states, the occurrence of hospital deaths was especially high in Amazonas (34.1%) and Rio de Janeiro (32.1%), with figures also higher than the national average (24.4%) in Pernambuco (27.8%) and Maranhão (27.6%). The Amazonian states of Acre, Roraima and Amapá corresponded, respectively, to 0.1%, 0.8% and 0.3% of hospitalizations in the country, but they are states with relatively small populations, which stood out for the high proportions of observed hospital deaths -43.8%, 35.9% and 44.7%, respectively. The states of Alagoas (30.6%), Espírito Santo (28.9%), Bahia (27.3%) and Rio Grande do Norte (26, 8%) also had hospital death percentages higher than the national average. Table 3 also shows that 81.7% of admissions for COVID-19 in the first four months of the epidemic in the country occurred in municipalities with more than 100 thousand inhabitants, with more deaths observed in these municipalities than in other smaller ones. More than ¾ of hospitalizations were carried out in hospitals located in the same municipality of residence of the patient, with a higher occurrence of deaths when the patient had to travel to receive hospital care. Table 4 presents the three regression models that explain the occurrence of hospital death, considering the progressive inclusion of the ""blocks"" of variables already mentioned. The first line of the table provides the variance of random intercepts related to hospital units for each model.Considering model 3, it is possible to observe that the odds of hospital death among men were 16.8% higher than among women. The patient's age group was also an important predictor of the likelihood of death. Compared to patients between 18 and 39 years old, patients aged 40 to 49 years were 54.7% more likely to die in the hospital, while for patients aged 90 years or more this increase reached 1,604.9%. Furthermore, blacks had higher odds of death during the hospital stay (OR = 1.14; 95% CI 1.05-1.25), compared to the reference category including whites, yellows, indigenous and individuals without a record of the variable. The adjusted risk of hospital death for browns was not statistically significant at the 5% level, but ""borderline"".Despite the substantial underreporting of clinical conditions, the behavior of the Charlson and Elixhauser indices was consistent with the hypothesis of higher odds of death among patients with comorbidities. The odds of death were 37.2% and 88.1% (model 3) higher among patients with Charlson index scores equal to 1 and ≥2, respectively, compared to those with score equal to zero, controlling for other variables. For those with Elixhauser comorbidities, the adjusted odds of dying were 41.1% higher than for those without such comorbidities. Presence of hypertension (OR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.73-0.99) and diabetes (OR = 0.75; 95% CI 0.61-0.91) had protective effects, regardless of the inclusion of the other comorbidity measures. Obesity was statistically associated with higher odds of hospital death (56.3% higher among obese people, compared to non-obese people). Finally, patients who had COVID-19 as a secondary diagnosis, liable, in some cases, to have acquired the infection in the hospital itself, had 14.9% higher odds of dying in the hospital than those who had the disease registered as the main diagnosis.The study provides a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 hospitalizations that occurred in the SUS, including 89,405 hospitalizations, among which 24.4% resulted in death. By focusing on the exploration of explanatory factors for the occurrence of death during hospitalizations due to COVID-19, it contributes with relevant findings to the international debate, confirming knowledge that has been consolidated, raising questions and exposing specificities of the Brazilian context.Sociodemographic factors and the presence of comorbidities have been identified as associated with COVID-19 hospitalization and death 20, 21 . Similar to what was described in other studies, males, older age group gradually higher, black race/color, Charlson score, presence of Elixhauser comorbidity and obesity presented a higher adjusted odds of death 7,8,22-24 .Hypertension and diabetes showed protective effect, which seems paradoxical and inconsistent with some reports in the literature 17, 29 . However, these findings refer mainly to critical cases and the control by other variables may have modified their effect. On the other hand, in a review of the relationship between hypertension and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with COVID-19 outcomes, the authors argue that despite the potential role of immune responses in the pathogenesis of hypertension, there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that hypertension or inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system contribute to unfavorable outcomes in viral infections. The study emphasizes that there is no current scientific basis for stating that hypertension or its treatment with drugs of the blocking class of the reninangiotensin system contribute to unfavorable results in COVID-19 30 . It is noteworthy that despite the low levels of comorbidity reporting in our data (only about 20% of hospitalizations), compared to what was reported by Petrilli et al. (2020) , in which 80% of hospitalized patients had at least one of the chronic diseases examined, the strategies for measuring the comorbidities used were also associated with higher risk of death 20 .Obesity has been identified as a risk factor. This finding is consistent with international studies that have shown that obesity is a risk factor for mortality among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, regardless of whether it is associated with other comorbidities and potential confounding factors 31 .It is important to remember that the pandemic has evolved dynamically throughout the country.",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-05,9
c37932cb0030ccd4a36dcaacb245b197a167b566,Early Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Convalescent Plasma in Patients Admitted for COVID- 19: A Randomized Phase II Clinical Trial,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has left over 24 million contagions and 833,000 deaths by August 29, 2020 [1] . Different case-series have shown an intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate between 5 and 16%, and a case fatality rate near 1-4%, with a direct relationship with age and comorbidities [2] [3] [4] .To date, there is no validated treatment nor immunization against SARS-CoV-2. A promising alternative is immune plasma from convalescent patients [5] . This strategy has been used with some success in other viral diseases with important lethality such as hantavirus, influenza, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections [6] [7] [8] [9] .The use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 was reported early in this pandemic. The initial caseseries studies suggested faster clinical recovery, viral clearance and radiologic improvement, although the lack of a controlled group limited the accurate interpretation of these results [10] [11] [12] .Subsequently, a preliminary report of a matched controlled study showed convalescent plasma improved survival for non-intubated patients [13] . However, the first two randomized controlled trials showed no clear clinical benefit, and furthermore, one of these trials was stopped early due to concerns when finding high pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers in receptors before transfusion [14, 15] Considering that COVID-19 likely involves at least two phases -an early phase in which viral replication is a component of tissue injury and a later phase in which a dysregulated and proinflammatory immune response leads the damage -the most useful therapeutic window for convalescent plasma administration is currently unknown [16] . Indeed, the lack of efficacy of previous studies has been attributed to a late timing of plasma administration in the disease's course. This hypothesis is consistent with the recent finding of lower mortality for patients receiving convalescent plasma within the first 3 days after COVID-19 diagnosis in a large uncontrolled study [17] .The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma therapy in reducing disease progression, complications, and death in patients in the early phase of COVID-19.This study consisted of a randomized, controlled, open-label phase II trial done in a single Chilean medical center in Santiago, Chile. Patients were randomized from May 10, 2020, to July 18, 2020, with final follow-up August 17, 2020.Inclusion criteria were the following: (1) patients over 18 years old; (2) hospitalized, symptoms present at enrollment and confirmed with a positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in nasopharyngeal swab or, pending PCR result but imaging consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia and confirmed COVID-19 close-contact; (3) ≤ 7 days from COVID-19 symptoms onset to enrollment; (4) a CALL score  9 points at enrollment (predicts high-risk of progression into respiratory failure, based on age, comorbidities, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and lymphocyte count) [18] ; (5) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status before SARS-CoV-2 infection 0-2.Exclusion criteria were the following: (1) PaO2/FiO2<200 or need for mechanical ventilation at enrollment; (2) coinfection with other relevant respiratory pathogens on admission; (3) pregnancy or lactation; (4) known IgA Nephropathy or IgA deficiency; (5) previous immunoglobulin or plasma administration within the last 60 days; (6) previous severe transfusion reactions; (7) do not resuscitate indication; (8) participating in another COVID-19 interventional study; and (9) patients that under investigator criteria had any condition that made them unsuitable for study participation.Plasma was obtained from volunteer subjects who had recovered from COVID-19, having been asymptomatic for at least 28 days, with a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR both in nasopharyngeal swab and in plasma, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S1) IgG titers  1:400 (ELISA Euroimmun®). Donor plasma was tested for standard infectious diseases before administration and extracted plasma was immediately frozen at -20°C according to standard national safety measures [19] .Eligible patients were randomly assigned via computer-generated numbering by a block randomization sequence into two groups: early or deferred plasma transfusion. Randomization was done by an independent member, and the sequence was concealed to study investigators.The early plasma group received the first plasma unit at enrollment. The deferred plasma group received convalescent plasma only if a pre-specified worsening respiratory function criterion was met during hospitalization (Pa02/Fi02 <200) or if the patient still required hospitalization for symptomatic COVID-19 >7 days after enrollment ( Figure 1 ).Transfusions considered a total of 400 mL of ABO compatible convalescent plasma, infused as two 200 mL units, each separated by 24 hours. In both groups, cointerventions, including antibiotics, antivirals, heparin thromboprophylaxis, and immunomodulators, were allowed based on the hospital protocols.The primary outcome was a composite of mechanical ventilation, hospitalization >14 days or inhospital death.Secondary outcomes included: days of mechanical ventilation, days of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), days of oxygen requirement, time to respiratory failure development (PaO2/FiO2<200), the severity of multiple organ dysfunction (by SOFA score) at day 3 and 7; days in ICU or intermediate care unit, hospital length of stay, and mortality at 30 days. The kinetics of inflammatory biomarkers, including total lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, LDH, D-dimer, ferritin and IL-6 were determined on days 0, 3 and 7; and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swab on days 3 and 7.Radiological outcomes included the comparison of infiltrates progression on chest CT scans on enrollment and day 5, based on COVID-19 pneumonia severity scores [20] [21] [22] [23] . For the combined analysis with portable chest X-rays, a blinded thoracic radiologist expert categorized images as ""progression"" vs ""stable or improved"".Also, pre-planned analyses of baseline neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) titers, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers were determined in participants from the early plasma group and in the subset of participants from the deferred plasma group who had not yet received plasma on days 0, 3 and 7.Safety outcomes were evaluated in all participants.Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA For specific IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) we used the commercial kit CE-marked Euroimmun (Lübeck, Germany, # EI 2606-9601 G), which uses the S1-domain of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as antigen. Fresh or thawed serum samples were first diluted at 1:101, then 2-fold serial dilutions were done until 1:6400. Immunoreactivity was measured at an optical density (OD) of 450 nm. Results were expressed according to the manufacturer. The end-point dilution for each sample was determined as the final dilution where the OD ratio (patient/calibrator) was ≥1.1. Seroconversion was defined as seronegative at baseline and seropositive after 3 or 7 days or, a 4-fold increase in endpoint dilution titer from the baseline.Anti-SARS-CoV-2 NAbs were measured in serum samples using an HIV-1 backbone expressing firefly luciferase as a reporter gene and pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein [24, 25] . Given the results obtained in an ongoing study with pre-pandemic sera in Chilean population, 1:160 was The primary binary outcomes were assessed through chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact test when appropriate, and odds ratios (ORs) are presented together with 95% CI and p-values. Results of the main analysis are presented as crude analysis. In addition, we adjusted for age and SOFA score at enrolment, as fixed (individual-level) effects, using logistic regression. For secondary outcomes, binary variables were analyzed using logistic regression. Numerical variables were examined using generalized linear models with log link function and gamma family function. For those variables with high number of zeros, we used a zero-inflated negative binomial model because it showed better goodness of fit compared with other zero-inflated models according to the Akaike information criterion. Treatment effects estimates, crude and adjusted by age and SOFA, are presented as exponentiated coefficients, i.e., ORs and incidence rate ratios (IRRs), respectively, with their corresponding 95%CI. In those cases where asymptotic assumptions did not hold, crude estimates were analyzed with Fisher´s exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon-rank-sum test for continuous variables. To test differences between Kaplan-Meier estimates in survival analysis, we used the Log-Rank test.For paired CT scans scores analysis, we used Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test.Statistical significance was defined using a 2-sided significance level of α = .05. The statistical analysis was performed by an investigator who was blind to the study group allocation. Analyses were done with R version 3.6.3 and figures with GraphPad Prism version 8.4.3 software.This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. Written informed consent was solicited from each patient or their legal representatives.All participants (n=28) from the early plasma group received a 1 st plasma unit on the day of enrollment and 24 (86%) received a 2 nd unit 24 hours later. Reasons for not receiving the 2 nd unit were death (n=2) or a serious adverse event (SAE) after the first plasma unit administration (n=2).A total of 13 participants (43.3%) from the deferred plasma group received plasma at a median time of 3 days from enrollment (IQR 1-5), based on respiratory failure development (n=12) or persistent symptomatic COVID-19 beyond 7 days after enrollment (n=1).There was no significant difference between the early and deferred plasma group in the composite primary outcome: 32.1% (9/28) in the early plasma group vs 33.3% (10/30) Table 2) .Immune response subgroup analysis: SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers were determined in patients who received early plasma and in the subset of patients from the deferred plasma group who had not yet received plasma, at baseline, day 3 and day 7. No significant differences were observed in IgG SARS-CoV-2 seropositive rate at the three timepoint, nor in IgG seroconversion rates between plasma receptors and no plasma receptors at day 3 (69% vs 40%, p=0.07) or at day 7 (87 vs 83%, p=1.00) ( Figure 5, A and B) .Regarding NAbs titers, all infused plasma samples tested (n=18) had a positive ID50 at screening dilution titer (data not shown). The NAbs were also quantified for a total of 44 study patients: at enrolment, 59% (26/44) did not reach the screening cutoff (50% of neutralization) at the 1/160 dilution ( Figure 5C ). Interestingly, only 16% (3/19) of patients enrolled before day 5 since COVID-19 symptoms onset had ID50 titers ≥1:160, compared to 60% (15/25) of those enrolled after day 6 (p=0.005) ( Figure 5D ).Among all 41 patients receiving plasma in this study, there were four possibly related adverse events (3 cases of fever, 1 rash) and three SAEs (7.3%). Two patients developed severe respiratory deterioration within <6 hours after plasma infusion and were categorized as possible transfusionassociated acute lung injury (TRALI) type II [27] . One of the later patients additionally developed severe thrombocytopenia within 48h after plasma transfusion, with negative antiplatelet antibodies and megakaryocytic hyperplasia in the bone-marrow analysis. Platelet count remained low in the following weeks, despite platelet transfusions, steroids and immunoglobulin therapy, requiring splenectomy, rituximab and eltrombopag before slow stabilization. This event was diagnosed as a COVID-19 possibly related complication.In this randomized clinical trial of symptomatic COVID-19 patients admitted early, we did not find significant differences in the composite primary outcome of death, mechanical ventilation or prolonged hospitalization, by administering immediate convalescent plasma, compared to plasma only in case of clinical worsening.Convalescent plasma was not associated with a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR clearance in nasopharyngeal swabs, suggesting that it does not provide a strong antiviral activity at this stage in patients with COVID-19. In accordance with this finding, transfused patients did not present a significant rise of SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels on days 3 and 7 compared to the natural increase in IgG titers in non-plasma infused patients, which could explain such lack of effect.We actively selected patients at high risk of developing complications -based on CALL prediction score -and, over 40% of our participants developed severe respiratory failure. The lack of clinical benefit from convalescent plasma therapy in these patients may be explained by several reasons.Firstly, humoral immunity may not play a major role in the subset of patients who have already initiated a highly pro-inflammatory response and in whom inflammation and coagulopathy may be more important than viral replication[28]. We do not know whether pre-selection of plasma units with a very high concentration of NAbs could have succeeded in blunting this dysregulated inflammatory response. Additionally, an early adaptive immune response might be necessary to drive a more effective infection control. Indeed, different cellular and humoral responses are generated in mild or severe COVID-19 cases, and it has been reported that a specific cellular response can be detected early in the course of non-severe COVID-19[29] , [30] .Secondly, limited efficacy may be due to a late administration in the course of the disease, in which a dysregulated immune response predominates and is independent of the virus cell entry blockade achieved by immunoglobulins [5, 16] . Previous randomized trials of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 included patients who had a longer time gap between symptoms onset and transfusion as well as a more severe disease at enrollment [14, 15] . Despite setting a strict ≤7 days of symptoms inclusion criterion, in our study, over 96% of subjects had already established pneumonia on enrollment.Plasma transfusion is not exempted from adverse events such as allergic reactions, infections transmission, and -very rarely-volume overload or TRALI [31] . In spite of the fact that the majority of clinical trials are still ongoing, convalescent plasma emergency use in COVID-19 treatment was recently approved by the FDA [32] . Reassuringly, in a recent report of 20,000 hospitalized patients receiving convalescent plasma for COVID-19, the incidence of related SAEs in the first four hours after infusion was <0.5% [33] . Nonetheless, in the present study, two participants developed acute respiratory failure after transfusion. Given that the patients were, according to the known evolution of COVID-19, in the peak of their inflammatory phase, it was challenging to determine if the respiratory failure corresponded to a TRALI [34] .Our study presents some limitations. Firstly, NAbs were not determined in donor plasma before the patient's transfusion and we could not select plasma units with the highest neutralizing activity.Secondly, although we selected a very homogeneous population, it is possible that the study was underpowered to detect a statistically significant difference. Thirdly, as an open-label study, cointerventions such as steroid use may have unintendedly influenced outcomes [35] . Such management was not standardized, although alternative drug therapies were equally distributed in both study arms.In conclusion, convalescent plasma transfusion in patients hospitalized in the early stage of COVID-19, compared to giving plasma only at clinical deterioration, did not improve clinical outcomes.Further research is needed to find the optimal use and timing of convalescent plasma in COVID-19.18.0 (15.8-22.5)",Chile,abstract,2020-09-18,9
58730947c8336ed9681f615a5c52df369a425b4c,"Journal Pre-proof Coronavirus Disease 2019 Population-based Prevalence, Risk Factors, Hospitalization, and Fatality Rates in Southern Brazil Title Page Coronavirus Disease 2019 Population-based Prevalence, Risk Factors, Hospitalization, and Fatality Rates in Southern Brazil","Brazil, a complex country with 210 million inhabitants, the fifth largest population in the world, has been enduring the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic since late February. Nationwide, up to mid-July, there were more than 2.1 million confirmed cases, with substantial geographic disparities, 80,000 COVID-19-related deaths, and a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 3,8% (Ministério da Saúde do Brasil, 2020). Brazilian CFR is in line with other developing nations, such as in countries of Southeast Europe, for which a CFR of 3.6% has been reported (Puca et al., 2020) .Nevertheless, confirmed cases are just a fraction of the symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected individuals who sought medical assistance.Hence, asymptomatic infections and the bulk of mild infections goes by undetected, leading to biased hospitalization and death rates . Thus, population-based studies are needed to estimate the true number of infected persons in order to calculate hospitalization and infections fatality rates (IFR) -crucial statistics for policy-making (Pearce et al. 2020) . Such studies are also useful to identify potential risk factors for infection (Lipsitch et al. 2015) .Small and mid-size cities are home for 2 billion people globally and are being harmed by the COVID-19 pandemic (United Nations, 2018; Piccininni et al., 2020) . We investigated the municipality of Lajeado, an industrial city with 84,014 inhabitants in Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost state of Brazil. The first case of COVID-19 in Lajeado was reported on March 20, assess COVID-19 prevalence, hospitalization, and IFR, as well as risk factors, in the general adult population of Lajeado.This is a cross-sectional study comprised of two household surveys designed to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Surveys were carried from May 30 to June 4 (Survey 1) and from June 13 to 17 (Survey 2), 2020.Lajeado population is 89% percent white. Population density is 917 inhabitants/km 2 (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística). The current adult (≥18 years-old) population is estimated to be 64,000 individuals.The target population was the 64,000 adults residing in Lajeado. The study population was the non-institutionalized adults of the target population.Both surveys followed identical inclusion and exclusion criteria. All the non-institutionalized adults from the target population were deemed eligible. Individuals <18 years-old were not eligible. Sampled adults were included after signing the informed consent form approved by the Universidade do Vale do Taquari (UNIVATES) institutional Ethics Review Board and by the Brazilian National Committee for Research Ethics on May 27, 2020 (CAAE 32029520.9.0000.5310). If a participant tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, all of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f her/his adult household contacts were included in the study after signing informed consent form. Participants who refused or withdraw consent were excluded.For Survey 1, the calculated sample size was 1500 adults assuming an intracluster correlation coefficient (ρ) of 0.034 and a design effect (DEFF) of 2 (Killip 2004) . Other parameters were: a target population of 64,000, an expected crude prevalence of 2%, a 1% margin of error with 95% confidence interval, and 52 primary sampling units (PSU). In Survey 1, the actual observed ρ was 0.017 and DEFF was 1.45. This allowed us to use a DEFF of 1.50 for Survey 2 and, hence, a sample size of 1100 adults. In Survey 2, the observed ρ and DEFF were 0.023 and 1.49, respectively.We performed separate multi-stage cluster samplings for each survey (Kalton, 1983) . In the first stage, we selected 52 census sectors (out of 120) as PSU through simple random sampling (SRS). Next, we selected city blocks (secondary sampling units; SSU) within a census sector using SRS. Field researchers followed a predetermined random sequence of SSU until the target number of participants per PSU was attained. Tertiary sampling units (TSU) were households within a block, selected by the field researchers on site through systematic sampling of one every three households. Finally, we randomly selected one adult present at the household via SRS. If the sampled adult refused to participate or withdraw consent, the household was excluded and the next available TSU was selected.We tested all participants for specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in capillary blood using Wondfo lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA; Guandzhou Wondfo Biotech Co., Ltd, Guanzhou, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f China). If a sampled participant tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, we tested all adult household contacts with LFIA immediately or on the next day if not present.Wondfo LFIA detects IgM and IgG class antibodies and the cassette displays the result as a single test band, not discriminating IgM from IgG. Compared to RT-PCR, Wondfo LFIA has a reported near-perfect specificity of 99.57%(Guandzhou Wondfo Biotech) and, after more than five days since symptoms onset, a sensitivity of 76.24% (Whitman et al., 2020) .To detect current active infection, we performed RT-PCR testing in all participants who had two consecutive invalid LFIA, sampled participants who were LFIA-negative and reported fever, anosmia, or dysgeusia with onset on the past seven days, and all LFIA-negative household contacts (deemed as possible false-negative). Following study protocol, agents of the Participants were interviewed at home using pretested electronic questionnaires to assess demographics, adherence to social distancing recommendations, and recent-onset influenzalike symptoms. We evaluated age, sex (as in participants ID), self-reported skin color, adherence to social distancing recommendations, schooling years, household's average monthly income, and participant's occupation -particularly employment status in any of the local MPP.We measured adherence to specific social distancing recommendations through five-point Likert-scale questions and global adherence to social distancing both with a five-point Likertscale and a zero-to-ten-point visual analogue scale (zero = no adherence; ten = perfect adherence). To minimize recall bias, assessment of adherence to social distancing was restricted to the past 30 days. Previous Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination was evaluated by the presence of the unmistakable round scar on participants proximal right arm, the standard injection site in Brazil.Household contacts and MPP workers were explored as risk factors for infection. BCG vaccine was evaluated as a potential protector. Age, sex, income, and schooling were regarded as confounding.The primary outcome was past or current SARS-CoV-2 infection. We employed only data from probabilistically sampled participants to estimate population prevalence, not household contacts.We rated participants as positive for infection if any of the following criteria were met: (i) a positive LFIA (past infection); (ii) if LFIA-negative, had nasopharyngeal RT-PCR with detectable SARS-CoV-2 particles (current active infection); or (iii) if LFIA-negative, had either a prior immunoassay report or a prior respiratory tract RT-PCR report positive for SARS-CoV-2 (previous documented infection).Secondary outcomes were COVID-19-related deaths, hospitalizations, and need for intensive care unit (ICU) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Using official records provided by the MESA, we accounted for all laboratory-proven COVID-19-related hospital admissions and deaths among Lajeado resident population that took place anywhere in Brazil from March 15 to June 20, 2020. Given the retrospective nature of serological diagnosis and that the median time from symptoms onset to death is 11 days in Brazil (Ministério da Saúde and Secretaria de Vigilância em Saúde, 2020b), we considered June 20 to be an adequate end-date for the assessment of lethality. We crosschecked MESA records with the records from Hospital Bruno Born, Lajeado's sole general hospital.We calculated surveys response rates as the number of participants included in the analyzes divided by the number of households approached by field researchers:Using equation proposed by Diggle and assuming a perfect (100%) specificity, we corrected seroprevalence rates for LFIA sensitivity dividing the crude LFIA-positive rate by 0.7624: (Diggle, 2011) . We attained final SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence by adding the corrected seroprevalence rate to the rate of current active infection plus the rate of previous documented infection. We also adjusted infection prevalence for DEFF by attributing weights inversely proportional to participants selection probability (Zou et al., 2020) .Overall and age-stratified IFR and hospitalization rates were ratios of the number of laboratory-proven COVID-19-related deaths and hospital admissions over the estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, overall and per age-stratum:. We used Lajeado population pyramid to estimate the number of infections per age stratum (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística). We aggregated participants into three age groups: 20 to 39, 40 to 59, and ≥60 years-old. We regressed IFR and hospitalization rates over age group using nonlinear (exponential) coefficients of determination (R 2 ) (Kva°Lseth, 1983) . The equations for R 2 (y = ae bx ) are provided.We performed binary logistic regression, stratified by survey, using MPP workers and household contacts as predictors and SARS-CoV-2 infection status as dependent variable.Models' covariates, selected for their epidemiological relevance, were sex, age, schooling, and household's average monthly income. We converted the predictors' odds ratios into prevalence ratios (PR) using the formula describe by Zhang and Yu (Zhang and Yu, 1998) .We summarized overall and age-stratified prevalence rates and PR across surveys with metaanalyses. We chose to pool data with meta-analysis because each survey is a separate study on its own, with independent samples, the overall corrected prevalence of infection was not significantly different between Survey 1 and 2 (P = 0.051), and DEFF-adjusted confidence intervals for crude prevalence of infection were very similar to unadjusted intervals. Since the target population was the same in both surveys, we used fixed-effect models to summarize the corrected prevalence of infection, assuming that all between-study variance was due to sampling error (Borenstein, 2009 The peak of daily confirmed cases occurred on early May, but was somewhat ""artificial"" due to mass serological screening performed at MPP. Most detected infections were already cured at the time of mass screening. Daily hospital admissions, daily confirmed cases, and active cases rapidly declined after the end of Survey 1 (Figure 1 ).Survey response rates were very high: 84.8% and 88.7% on Survey 1 and 2, respectively. Eighty percent of the households' adults were at home, therefore, available for sampling selection.In both surveys, we selected 2631 individuals, but, at random, 54 (2.1%) participants had missing data due to a glitch in the electronic data collection forms. Thus, we included 2577 participants in final analysis. Standardized mean differences meta-analyses showed SARS-CoV-2-positive participants were poorer (p=0.049) and less educated (p<0.001). Skin color was not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection on adjusted logistic regressions (P-values of 0.931 and 0.056 in Surveys 1 and 2, respectively). Prevalence of infection was similar between sexes.SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative participants reported similar adherence to social distancing recommendations (Table 1) .Summarized overall prevalence was 3.40% (95% CI, 2.74 to 4.18). Prevalence was significantly lower in elderly ≥60 years-old: 2.26 (95%; CI 1.34 to 3.58) (Figure 2) . Total estimated number of infections in Lajeado adult population was 2178 (95% CI, 1752 to 2673).During the study period, there were 79 laboratory-proven COVID-19-related hospitalizations, with 29 patients requiring ICU beds and 14 needing IVM. There were no hospitalizations or deaths in adults aged 18 to 19 years. Among the institutionalized population, 12 elderly J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (ranging 74 to 90 years-old) living in three different nursing homes were hospitalized and eight of them died.Rates per age group are seen in Table 2 . Overall IFR, hospitalization rate, and need for ICU and IMV rates were 0.60% (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.74), 3.63% (95% CI, 2.96 to 4.51), 1.33% (95% CI, 1.08 to 1.66), and 0.64% (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.80), respectively. IFR and morbidity rates were exponentially higher in the elderly (Figure 3) , with very high R 2 values (Table 2) .Among MPP workers, prevalence of infection was 11.91% (95% CI 6.36-19.78), 5.4 times higher than in non-workers ( Figure 4A Sixty-eight (77.3%) contacts were studied and 31 (crude count) were positive for SARS-CoV-2summarized corrected prevalence 61.33% (95% CI, 48.93 to 72.74). Three LFIA-negative contacts had detectable SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR and two of them were asymptomatic. Adjusted prevalence among household contacts was 14 times higher than the general population ( Figure 4B ). Prevalence of infection was similar between BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated participants ( Figure 4C ).To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide population-based estimates on SARS-CoV-2 IFR and hospitalization rate per age stratum. Another survey from Rio Grande do Sul reported state-wide overall IFR of up to 0.38% (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.80), within range of our overall 0.60% IFR (Silveira et al., 2020) . We detected striking age-dependent morbidity and lethality, disfavoring the elders. Population-based IFR and hospitalization rate were, respectively, 57.9 and 7.7 times higher in elderly than younger adults. This corroborates the age-dependent J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f severity and lethality of COVID-19 observed in healthcare settings (Onder et al., 2020; Williamson et al., 2020) . Accordingly, nursing homes are a critical issue in the current pandemic since elderly living at long-term care facilities are probably the subpopulation most vulnerable to COVID-19 adverse outcomes (American Geriatrics Society, 2020; Bigelow et al., 2020) . In Lajeado, 13% and 38% of all COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths, respectively, occurred among elderly living at nursing homes, a small segment of the general population. Despite lower prevalence of infection among the elders, they carry most of the disease burden (American Geriatrics Society, 2020; Stringhini et al., 2020) .In this study, the combination of very high response rates, fully probabilistic selection of participants, relatively large sample size (4% of the entire target population), and high availability of individuals for SRS assured populational representativeness. The majority of prevalence studies to date have had either low response rates (33.7% in Iceland) (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020) , did not use fully probabilistic sampling (Geneva and Rio Grande do Sul) (Silveira et al., 2020; Stringhini et al., 2020) , or evaluated convenience samples (Los Angeles County and 10 US sites) (Havers et al., 2020; Sood et al., 2020) . On the other hand, a large well-designed household survey with fully probabilistically sampling, estimated a nationwide seroprevalence of 5.0% in Spain, but with considerable variability across provinces, ranging from 0.5% to 13.0% (Pollán et al., 2020) . Similarly, the 3.4% prevalence observed in Lajeado was 15 times higher than Rio Grande do Sul statewide seroprevalence of 0.22% estimated in early May (Silveira et al., 2020) .In Geneva, the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic apparently subsided after a 10.8% seroprevalence (Stringhini et al., 2020) . We observed an important decrease in new confirmed COVID-19 cases and hospital admissions after prevalence reached 3.4%. Higher frequency of pre-existing immunity (Grifoni et al., 2020) , less transmissible viral strain , lower population density (Baker et al., 2020) , higher usage of face masks , J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f earlier depletion of the more susceptible subpopulation, or differences in population age structure (Gomes et al., 2020) , are among several plausible explanations for the seemingly more favorable unfolding in Lajeado. The influence of climate in the current pandemic remains not completely understood, but might have played a role (Baker et al., 2020) . BCG vaccine has been a part of the Brazilian National Immunization Program for many decades (Ministério da Saúde do Brasil). The vaccine has been hypothesized as a potential protector against SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its modulatory properties on the immune system (Arts et al., 2018; O'Neill and Netea, 2020) . Unfortunately, BCG vaccination was not associated with The prevalence of infection among household contacts was much higher than in randomly selected participants of the general population, reinforcing the known risk associated with domestic contacts (Chan et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . The same was observed in Spain, where prevalence in household members ranged from 15.1% to 37.4% (Pollán et al., 2020) . Low prevalence of infection in the general population and high PR associated with household contacts and MPP workers suggest a pattern of transmission highly dependent on prolonged exposure to close contacts, as previously reported (Yong et al., 2020) .A third survey could have been undertaken, but would not change our prevalence, IFR, and hospitalization rates as new confirmed cases and hospital admissions sharply decreased after Survey 1. Analyzed samples were predominately female. However, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was similar between sexes in other surveys (Pollán et al., 2020; Stringhini et al., 2020) , thus, the sex imbalance probably did not biased our analyzes.Forty percent of asymptomatic individuals may become seronegative eight weeks after infection (Long et al., 2020) . Therefore, if delayed, surveys that rely solely on seroprevalence may underestimate the true prevalence of infection due to insensitive measure bias (CEBM University of Oxford, 2019), a limitation that this study attempted to circumvent by contemplating previous documented infection. Furthermore, low plasma concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Robbiani et al., 2020) and memory T cells (Sekine et al., 2020) o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f em Saúde, 2020). The test's accuracy for detecting asymptomatic and mild infections is unknown since the LFIA was only validated for patients with moderate and severe COVID-19, but this is a limitation of all available serological assays (Deeks et al., 2020; Lisboa Bastos et al., 2020; Whitman et al., 2020) . Moreover, seroprevalence is just an approximation of the true prevalence of infection. Thus, to minimize underestimation of prevalence, we ascertained infection status using three end-points, including RT-PCR and previous documented infection.We assessed adherence to social distancing solely through questioning. The use of geographic information systems probably would have increased accuracy, but was considered not feasible (Kamel Boulos and Geraghty, 2020) .The decision to not investigate individuals <18 years-old was grounded on a growing body of evidence indicating that children and adolescents are less susceptible to infection (Munro and Faust 2020; Pollán et al. 2020; Stringhini et al. 2020) . Moreover, persons <20 year-old comprised <4% of confirmed cases in Lajeado during study planning (Secretaria Municipal de Saúde de Lajeado, 2020).Despite our efforts, is possible that the reported prevalence rates are underestimated due to residual insensitive measure bias, hence, overestimating hospitalization rates and IFR.Nonetheless, it is clear the elders are at substantially higher risk of adverse clinical outcomes and that MPP warrant deeper etiological studies to prevent future outbreaks. Our findings are valuable for health-policy making and resource allocation to mitigate the pandemic in other cities of similar size. Considering the possibility of a future second wave of COVID-19, data presented here can be used for disease modelling. ",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-16,9

ae2c061b784aa733fa7d71b210bb1d5c56cbc1b7,Epidemiology and Infection Pre-exposure prophylaxis during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: can PrEP prevent COVID-19-related symptoms?,"In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic situation of SARS-CoV-2 after several cases of pneumonia worldwide [1] . The milder and most frequent symptoms were identified as flu-like ones such as cough, fever, rhinorrhoea and headache [2] . Anosmia and ageusia were also included in this list of COVID-19-related symptoms [3] .In Brazil, by the end of February, close to carnival celebrations, the first suspected cases of COVID-19 started to appear [4] and were further confirmed by the reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Despite the country's president statements, governors of Brazilian states and the previous Ministry of Health, Dr. Luiz Henrique Mandetta, instituted social distancing, following the worldwide campaign proposed by the WHO to flatten the curve of COVID-19 incidence, also avoiding the health system collapse. Similar to other cities around the world, São Paulothe most populous city in Brazilchanged its routine to obey worldwide 'stay home' recommendations, preventing the virus from spreading.Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been available outside of clinical trials in Brazil since 2018 as a combined HIV prevention strategy, primarily for men who have sex with men, transgender women, sex workers and serodiscordant couples [5, 6] . Oral PrEP tablets contain 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and 200 mg emtricitabine (FTC). Users are required to come back to their prescribing clinic every 3 to 4 months for clinical and laboratory follow-up.This study aimed to identify associations between oral PrEP (TDF/FTC) use and COVID-19 symptoms self-reporting. These associations are intended to comprise preliminary data to support further investigation of the potential protective effect of PrEP against COVID-19 symptoms.This is a case-control and unique centre study developed at Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP), Brazil. This protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee on Research of the UNIFESP (CAAE 96087918.9.0000.5505) and was developed according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided informed consent through digital agreement via online survey or WhatsApp®.We enrolled PrEP users from our on-going cohort [7] . Inclusion criteria were regular use of oral PrEP for 6 months, at minimum, or discontinuation due to social distancing only (from March 2020 on, when social distancing was recommended in Brazil). All individuals who did not use PrEP regularly for other reasons were excluded.We obtained demographic and clinical data from the individual's chart at their prescribing clinic. Then, we contacted the individuals from 1st to 3rd April 2020 through phone call, WhatsApp® or e-mail as shown in Figure 1 , and invited them to respond to a few questions about oral PrEP use during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. The questions were:• Have you been taking PrEP regularly?• Have you been engaged in social distancing for the past 2 weeks? • Have you had contact with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19? • Have you had COVID-19-related symptoms over the last month? If yes, which ones (rhinorrhoea, cough, asthaenia, headache, sore throat, fever, decreased taste, dyspnoea, loss of smell, diarrhoea)?We considered each of the COVID-19-related symptoms separately and then aggregated them together to form a binary measure (e.g. experienced symptoms/did not experience symptoms). The first three questions were also taken as a dichotomous variable (yes or no).Data were analysed by a biostatistician using SPSS Statistics®, version 26. We set self-report of COVID-19-related symptoms as our primary outcome and used it as the dependent variable in logistic regression, which was controlled for confounders in four models: (1) social distancing; (2) social distancing and age; (3) social distancing, age and body mass index and (4) social distancing, age, body-mass index and comorbidities. As body-mass index [8] and comorbidities [9] [10] [11] are described to be risk factors for COVID-19, we decided to include them in our models. We did not include education as an independent variable because of the characteristics of our sample, in which the majority is highly educated. We used the PROCESS 3.5 SPSS plug-in to run the pathway analyses [12] . As we did not calculate sample size previously, we used Cohen's methods to estimate the effect size. We set α = 0.05 and confidence interval = 95% for all the tests. Some sample characteristics and COVID-19-related symptoms that are shown in descriptive statistics were not used in the regression analyses.We excluded nine individuals who could not be reached and two individuals who stopped taking oral PrEP before the COVID-19 pandemic. Our final sample accounted for 108 subjects.The majority of the individuals were cisgender (95.37%), white (86.11%), had a normal body-mass index (62.04%), and were gay men (90.74%). They were, on average, 33.9 (±8.36) years old and highly educated (96.30%). They had on average 44.5 (±72.83) sexual partners over the 6 months before the interview. Most of them had no morbidities (71.30%) and have not been taking other medications (56.48%). Few of them were sex workers (11.11%). Also, few of them (6.48%) were highly exposed to risky situations for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their occupation as physicians in the frontline against COVID-19 (Table 1) . Danilo Euclides Fernandes et al.Although most of the individuals engaged in social distancing (68.52%), they kept on taking oral PrEP (75.93%). Fewer people had had contact with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 (12.04%) and some individuals reported COVID-19-related symptoms the month before the interview (27.78%)rhinorrhoea (56.67%), cough (53.33%), asthaenia (50.00%) and headache (43.33%)and one of the subjects took oseltamivir without a medical prescription ( Table 2) .Cohen's h (h = 0.92) supports the power of our sample towards the primary outcome: self-reporting of COVID-19-related symptoms. Logistic regression test showed statistical significance for PrEP regular use (odds ratio (OR) 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07-0.96, P = 0.04; model 0) even after controlling for confounderssocial distancing, age, body-mass index and comorbiditiesas shown in Table 3 . Multiple logistic regressions showed that social distancing did not interfere with oral PrEP on selfreporting COVID-19-related symptoms. Additionally, a pathway analysis confirmed no moderation effect between oral PrEP regular use and the presence of the symptoms.Our study presents preliminary data that intended to support further investigation on the potential protective effect of oral PrEP against COVID-19 symptoms.Oral PrEP has been a combined HIV prevention strategy [5, 13] for both individual and populational HIV prophylaxis [14] . As we observed in this study, PrEP users tend to be young adults, highly educated and healthy [5, 13, 15] and their main goal is to stay free of diseases [16] . Our findings suggest that the regular use of PrEP is associated with lower self-reporting of COVID-19-related symptoms. We recognise that many aspects should be taken into account, but we found no evidence that other diseases [9] [10] [11] and body-mass index [8] affected the frequency of COVID-19related symptoms in our sample.Despite promising in vitro results on antiretroviral drug effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection [17, 18] , clinical research does not confirm their potential in vivo [19] . Some of those drugs can inhibit the viral RNA polymerase, which is vital for the SARS-CoV-2 cycle [17] , but none of them changed significantly the course of COVID-19 or its mortality rate [19] . Preliminary findings as ours help to guide epidemiological, experimental and clinical investigations for such a condition with no goldenstandard treatment as COVID-19.Few people stopped taking oral PrEP during social distancing, which supports that PrEP users are highly adherent to the treatment [15] , even on reduced sexual exposure. Self-reported symptoms included rhinorrhoea, cough, asthaenia, headache, fever, ageusia and/or anosmia, which have been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection [2, 10] . Low prevalence of dyspnoea and the absence of hospitalisation suggest mild symptomatology.Daily exposure to SARS-CoV-2 at the COVID-19 frontline put health care workers at higher risk of infection [20] . The seven physicians we have on our sample kept on taking oral PrEP and reported only mild symptoms as rhinorrhoea, cough, anosmia and/or ageusia, regardless of their daily risky routine.Our analyses showed that self-reported COVID-19-related symptoms were independently associated with oral PrEP regular use, even after controlling for confounders such as age [21, 22] , body-mass index [11] , and comorbidities [21, 22] . We confirmed that social distancing did not moderate PrEP protective effect through the pathway analysis and all the logistic regression models confirmed that oral PrEP reduced self-reporting of COVID-19 symptoms in our sample.Our findings suggest that oral PrEP associates with less selfreports of COVID-19-related symptoms, but we cannot state that oral PrEP reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection because a case-control study is inappropriate to do so. Additionally, we could not confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR or serology due to non-availability at the onset of the outbreak in Brazil, so we had to rely on the clinical presentation of COVID-19. Regardless of the limited sample size, we had powerful Cohen's coefficients and our multiple regression analysis remained strong enough to accept the independent variables we included.In our sample, the regular use of oral PrEP was associated with lower self-reporting of COVID-19-related symptoms during the outbreak in São Paulo, Brazil.Author contributions.

4b3443fe3689e65a637843c68864136834c6317f,rSWeeP: A R/Bioconductor package deal with SWeeP sequences representation,"In the era of Big Data, vector and alignment-free approaches to compare and represent biological sequences stand out for being more efficient than most alignment-based heuristic methods [1] . Studies show that vector representation of biological data presents an effective solution for the Bioinformatics field [2] [3] [4] [5] .Recently, SWeeP model presented expressive results in the analysis of complete proteomes. SWeeP is a model implemented in MatLab, which allows the representation of biological information through the projection of DNA sequences in vectors with reduced dimensionality [5] . Here, we present rSWeeP, an implementation of SWeeP model using R/Bioconductor programming language. To test the effectiveness of the implementation, we run a performance test, phylogenetic analysis and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) using viral proteomes as a dataset. Our results showed that rSWeeP maintains the effectiveness of SWeeP model in comparison of large numbers of sequences. In the case study, we identified the proximity between the virus responsible for the current SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic (COVID19) and the virus responsible for the SARS pandemic in 2003, suggesting that it is the same coronavirus, as already reported in other study [6] .All steps of rSWeeP implementation were performed on an Intel core I5 320Gz with 12 GB of RAM.Implementation. rSWeeP input is a multiFASTA file or an ""AAStringSet"" class object, containing amino acid sequences. rSWeeP consists in two main functions:(1) ""OrthBase"": to generate an orthonormal matrix in a specified size;(2) ""SWeeP"": to generate and project SWeeP vectors to compare the sequences information.Dataset. We used all viruses' sequences in the ""complete genome"" category on the NCBI assembly, available at https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Viruses/ (downloaded on February 6th, 2020). A tutorial for running rSWeeP and the trees are available at https://github.com/DanrleyRF/Suplementar. For all analysis, we applied the same protocol adopted in the study by De Pierri and colleagues (2020) [5] .Construction of Phylogenetic Trees. To explore the potential of the rSWeeP package, we created SWeeP vectors from the protein annotations of all the complete viral genomes available at NCBI, in total, 31,386 proteomes sequences (31k). A viral phylogenetic tree was built almost ten times larger than the reference found in the literature [3] .There are many specimens for each virus species. Thus, for a better comprehension of the viral taxonomic distribution, using the same vectors, we filter the data, selecting virus species classified as ""examples of ICTV (International Committee on Viral Taxonomy)"" [7] . A phylogenetic tree was built containing only one virus sample per species, totaling 4,833 viral proteomes (4k).Performance Test. The 31k tree was generated in 2 hours and 17 minutes, and the 4k tree took 13 minutes. rSWeeP had a processing time linear growth curve, as was already expected, of near 500 sequences compared per minute. Thereby, the functions presented by rSWeeP package can give computational power to its users to manage biological big data variables in a practical time.Global dataset analysis. We plotted the two principal components for the two data sets (31k and 4k). We observed that the data presented the same clustering pattern in relation to the type of organization of nucleic acids (Fig. 1) . It is evident the separation between the three main clades of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) (according to ICTV). We also observed some cases of incompatibility in the genomes, mainly in the ssDNA cluster. These divergences occur by viruses with genotypes that are not inserted in any clade. In addition, there are some cases of taxonomy and annotation errors in the NCBI database, also identified in the study by Calisher and colleagues (2006) [8] , and many of these annotations have not been corrected to date. This shows that rSWeeP presents a solution to accurately classify organisms taxonomically.According to Gorbalenya and collegues (2020) [6] , the criteria adopted to define the coronavirus of the current outbreak, as a ""new"" coronavirus would not be ideal, since it is the same coronavirus reported by Drostren C. and colleagues (2003) [9] .According to the ICTV, the new nomenclatures are SARS-CoV-1 -for the virus isolated inFor a virus to be considered as a new specimen, it should not be included in known groups, but distant from these groups [6] . Our phylogenetic analyzes corroborate this statement. In tree 4k (Figure 1c ) we identified the pneumonia strain isolated from the Wuhan seafood market (GCF_009858895.2) -responsible for the current SARS outbreak-is positioned remarkable close to the coronavirus strains related to severe acute respira-tory syndrome (GCF_000864885.1) and bat-beta coronavirus (GCF_000926915.1). This reinforces our previous assertation that rSWeeP is effective for analysis and taxonomic classification of viral organisms.We show the implementation of SWeeP model in R language, rSWeeP package, is equally accurate.

In just a few months, it quickly spread to all countries and killed more than 800,000 people, consuming tens of millions of jobs (Worldometer website) . COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which can be transmitted by two main ways: Contact (surface contact, i.e.fomites and contact with a contaminated person) and by air, via droplets and aerosol (Kutter et al., 2018; Patients et al., 2020; Setti et al., 2020; Stadnytskyi et al., 2020; Tellier et al., 2019; World Health Organization, 2020) . Influenza, another respiratory virus, has also caused tens of thousands of deaths worldwide each year. The Influenza virus, which can also cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), has forms of transmission similar to although there is no consensus on the relevance of each mode (Brankston et al., 2007; Killingley and Nguyen- Van-Tam, 2013; Krammer et al., 2018; Kutter et al., 2018; Lee, 2007; Tellier, 2006) . Therefore, the transmission of both is susceptible to climate conditions and, in the case of Influenza, seasonality is already described in the literature (Alonso et al., 2007; Carleton and Meng, 2020; Li et al., 2015; Moriyama et al., 2020; Petrova and Russell, 2018; Russell et al., 2008; Shaman and Kohn, 2009; Shimmei et al., 2020; Sobral et al., 2020) .The world pandemic caused by COVID-19 has demanded a huge effort of the scientific community to identify the relevant factors and their associations with virus transmission. As the virus spreads to new areas, more studies are required to understand the disease under the socioeconomic and climate conditions of different countries, especially those in Africa and South America (Belser, 2020; Marson and Ortega, 2020; Wilder-Smith et al., 2020) . Besides social distancing, the influence of climate variables on SARS-CoV-2 spread capacity has already been J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f explored by some studies (Ma et al., 2020; Qi et al., 2020; Tobías and Molina, 2020; Xie and Zhu, 2020) , as well as other factors (Domingo and Rovira, 2020; Sarmadi et al., 2020; Urrutia-Pereira et al., 2020) . However, the relations of climate variables were based only on subtropical regions, which makes the pandemic view somewhat early and narrow.Even for Influenza, only a few studies were conducted in tropical regions and a deep investigation of its relation with environmental variables is still needed (Alonso et al., 2007; Krammer et al., 2018) . However, such previous studies can provide important insights on , some studies analyzed the influence of temperature, humidity and rainfall (Auler et al., 2020; Prata et al., 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2020; Tenório and Lansac-tôha, 2020) for some Brazilian cities.Some factors cannot be ignored to address the spread of respiratory viruses as SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza. For instance, the effects of population age, hygiene measures, social distancing, socioeconomic conditions and climate. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the associations of COVID-19 cases and the number of hospital admissions by Influenza with atmospheric variables, social distancing and socio-economic conditions for different climate regions in Brazil. Besides, we compare the results of both diseases, aiming to establish a robust relation between Influenza and COVID-19.Brazil is the unique huge country that extends from the Equator to the subtropics (5 o 16`19`` N and 3 o 45`07`` S, with an area of 8 516 000 km 2 ) and thus has different climate zones (Fig. 1) .The socio-economic conditions also show wide variations inside the country; thus, it is a perfect J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f area to study the influence of these factors on the dissemination of COVID-19 and Influenza, two respiratory viruses with similarities in the modes of transmission. In addition, the inherent bias associated with the data record can be minimized using the information of the same country, mainly for COVID-19, which is a new disease. Another important feature used was to choose regions that do not represent the main gates for people and goods entering the country. The only exception was the state of Amazonas, the home of the Manaus Free Trade Zone. However, we kept the region in the study, since it is a very particular tropical area, where the main city of Manaus is surrounded by the largest tropical forest in the world. The Amazonas state has a low population density (2.23 inhabitants km -2 ), but 51% of the population is living in the capital Manaus. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Five Brazilian states representing different climate regimes were chosen (Fig. 1) . The state of Amazonas (AM) has a tropical rainforest climate, with annual average temperature and rainfall of 27.4 °C and 2145 mm, respectively. This type of climate is classified as Af (tropical without a dry season), following the Köppen climate classification (Alvares et al., 2013) . Maranhão (MA) and Ceará (CE) have a tropical savanna climate, predominantly Aw (tropical with a dry winter) and As (tropical with a dry summer), respectively. They have a similar annual pattern of rainfall and temperature, with low-temperature variations during the year, but with well-defined seasonality for the monthly rainfalls. For both states, the rainy season occurs between February and May, while the driest period occurs between August and November. Espírito Santo (ES), located in Southeast Brazil, has also a tropical savanna climate (Aw) in most of its area, but with monthly rainfall not changing significantly over the year, as in MA and CE. There is no welldefined dry season and only a slightly rainy period from November to January. The state of Paraná (PR) has well-defined seasons (summer, fall, winter and spring), with humid subtropical (Cfa and Cfb) oceanic climates, without a dry season. Curitiba is the main city of the state, and the average temperature and monthly rainfall are 17.1 °C and 130 mm (climate-data website).The meteorological data were compiled from the National Institute of Meteorology stations (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia -INMET, see supplementary material), which consisted of the average daily maximum and minimum temperature (°C), rainfall (mm), relative humidity (%), wind speed (m s -1 ) and insolation (hours), from January 1 st , 2017 to May 15 th , 2020 (INMET website). As the wind speed is not available for all stations, it was not included in the final regression analysis. By the way, no statistical significance was found for this variable in our analysis. should be shared between the three levels of government: federal, state and municipal administrations. However, only the last two moved to do something in their own way, without any coordination or effort from the Ministry of Health. As a measure of the recognized effect of social distancing on COVID-19 dissemination, we used the Community Mobility Reports trends, an indicator provided by Google (Google covid19 website). This mobility reports show the relative percentual changes in the averaged categorized places concerning baseline days (Jan 3 rd -J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Feb 6 th , 2020), named as mobility. These data present a good linear correlation with a similar product provided by Apple.As socio-economic indicators, we used: access to clean water supply, the elderly fraction (≥ 60 years old), and the Human Development Index (HDI) which, in summary, is a measure of three key dimensions related to development: income, education and health. The number of tests performed was also considered in the regression analysis. The indicators were obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics and the Ministry of Regional Development (IBGE and SNIS websites). Table 1 shows the values of these variables for each state, besides information concerning the population, case fatality rate (CFR), and the number of Intensive Care Units (ICU) available for the studied states. A descriptive analysis of atmospheric variables and health data was performed. A Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS), combined with the negative binomial distribution, a distribution belonging to the exponential family (Hastie and Robert, 1990; Wedderburn, 1974; Stasinopoulos et al., 2018) , were used to investigate the potential influence of the atmospheric and socio-economic variables on COVID-19 cases and Influenza hospitalizations, as well to determine the most important variables among those analyzed. The model systematic part is given by:where, x ji are the explanatory variables from j=1, 2,…,6; and from time (day) from i=1,…,n: maximum and minimum temperatures, relative humidity, rainfall frequency, insolation and social distancing measured by mobility (only for COVID-19). Rainfall was added to the model as a binary variable (0 without rain, 1 with rain), since the interest was to observe the effect of its occurrence and not of intensity. HDI is the Human Development Index, water corresponds to the percentage of homes with access to clean water supply in the state, elderly is the fraction of the population aged ≥ 60 years, and test is the number of tests done per 100,000 inhabitants. These variables allowed to observe the scenarios between each studied Brazilian state since the socioeconomic and population characteristics are quite variable.After contamination, there is a latency period of the virus in the organism. The incubation period for viruses is quite variable; in general, the interval between exposure and the onset of symptoms varies from 2 to 7 days (Lauer et al., 2020; Lessler et al., 2009 . Therefore, for this study, lags from 0 to 7 days were considered. Exposure-response curves were also plotted at lag 3 (3 days of interval between exposure and the onset of symptoms and their notification in this study), using the Distributed Lag Non-linear Model (DLNM), with reference values centered on the median of the variable (Gasparrini, 2011) . Finally, the values of relative risks (RR), at 95% confidence (CI), were calculated for each variable in the states.Statistical analyses were performed using the software R 3.6.1 (R Core Team, 2019). were also those with the highest percentage of relative humidity (mean above 75%). The state of PR, with the lowest temperatures and humidity, presented the most dispersed values for maximum and minimum temperatures. In terms of relative humidity, the greatest dispersion was observed for MA. Insolation was significantly higher for PR, around 8 hours, which is almost the double of the average for the other states.The social distancing proposed by the local authorities reduced urban mobility by up to 50%, comparing with the baseline (Jan 3 rd -Feb 6 th , 2020). The reduction in mobility was not significant, but much worse for AM, where the adhesion to social distancing was lower and mobility was reduced by only 20% in the studied period.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f probably due to . The CFR values presented in Table 1 are higher when compared to statistics reported to other countries (Banerjee et al., 2020; Verity et al., 2020) . The RR calculated for COVID-19 cases is shown in Social distancing, measured by mobility changes in this study, also presented a well-marked RR for all states, which corroborates the influence of social distancing measures as recommended by the WHO and already observed for Brazil (Aquino et al., 2020; Tenório and Lansac-tôha, 2020; Valenti et al., 2020) . The comparison of the exposure-response curves of mobility and RR at lag 3 is presented in Figure 4 . For CE, ES, MA and PR, exposure-response curves of mobility and RR present a similar behavior. Without any reduction in mobility (100% on the mobility axis of In all states analyzed in this study, a one-week interval was observed between exposure and the onset of COVID-19 notifications, but shorter intervals, usually 3 days, were also observed. This time lag estimated here is in the set of variables and it is the interval between the exposure and the notification. The first symptoms after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 normally occur after 2 to 7 days, but it can extend up to 14 days, which is considered the quarantine time for COVID-19 (Jiang et al., 2020; Lauer et al., 2020) .Socio-economic conditions (HDI) proved to be the most important risk factor among the states.This suggests a difficulty for people to understand the importance of hygiene measures and social distancing on the spread of COVID-19. In addition, the index indirectly measures the difficulty J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f that people have to keep social distancing due to the daily need to search for resources for their livelihood. Therefore, income and education levels are the main relevant factors.The access to the health care system is another important factor related to socio-economic conditions that can also help explain the high number of deaths in AM, CE, and MA, the states with less ICU available by inhabitant (see Table 1 ). The fraction of elderly, one additional information captured by the HDI, is also an important risk factor, as already noticed and documented by Health Systems around the world (Banerjee et al., 2020; Yi-ru Wang, 2020; Verity et al., 2020) . The elderly are the most vulnerable group to COVID-19.The statistical description of atmospheric variables from 2017 to 2019 is presented in the supplementary material (Fig. S.3) . The prevalence of Influenza hospitalizations (ICD J09-J11) is presented in Figure 5 . The state of MA presented the highest prevalence of Influenza. For MA and CE, a peak of prevalence is observed in March/April, which differs from PR and ES, with a peak in May/June, and AM, with a peak not clear. The prevalence of Influenza in Brazil is quite variable, and the fatality rate is 0.4/100,000 inhabitants (for 2019), according to the Brazilian Ministry of Health. This variation is dependent on several factors, including climate conditions, which show wide variations across Brazil. Influenza presents a well-defined seasonality (Fig. 5 and Fig. S.4) , as observed for other parts of the world. However, it is not possible to attribute the same association to climate, as observed in other parts of the world.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Table 3 presents the Influenza RR and CI for the analyzed variables. As mentioned before, the wind speed was previously analyzed, and the results indicate that this variable is not significant.Maximum temperature and humidity are the main atmospheric risk factors for hospital admissions by influenza in all analyzed climate regimes. Besides, CE and ES also presented significant RR for minimum temperature and insolation (protective effect), while PR for rainfall frequency.The results do not indicate HDI as an important factor when comparing the states, although clean water supply is a risk factor, indicating that other socio-economic inequalities should be explored, besides those measured by HDI. An important aspect for all Brazilian states is the annual influenza vaccination program of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS, http://www.saude.gov.br/sistema-unico-de-saude), that provides free influenza vaccine for vulnerable groups (elderly > 60 years old, pregnant women, children under 5 years old, chronic patients, health workers and indigenous population). Therefore, the vaccine is a protective factor J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f for the population, independently of income, which can explain this result for HDI. On the other hand, age is the most important risk factor for influenza, as demonstrated by an RR of 1.7151 (95% CI: 1.6742-1.7574). The set of variables presented a pronounced RR at lag 3 for hospitalization due to Influenza, which is in agreement with the latency time for the virus (Lessler et al., 2009; O'Shea et al., 2019) .The regression analysis performed from March 1 st to May 15 th of years 2017-2019 for Influenza provide similar results of those obtained using the total daily data from 2017-2019 (Table 3) , with the elderly as the most important factor, with significant RR for temperature and humidity, and no significant RR for HDI (see Table S .2). The rainfall and minimum temperature were risk factors in AM, which is consistent with the year station and the annual prevalence of Influenza.Comparing socio-economic characteristics, HDI showed statistical significance for COVID-19and Influenza, and Amazonas was the state with the highest significance for this variable (see the p-value in Table S .3). The percentage of elderly people was statistically more significant in MA for COVID-19 while, for influenza, it was PR. In the case of access to clean water supply, the highest statistical significance was observed in the state of CE for both influenza and COVID-19.The two states with the lowest number of tests per 100,000 inhabitants, MA and PR, showed higher significance (α = 0.001).HDI and the elderly are important factors for COVID-19 cases, while the elderly fraction is remarkably the main factor for Influenza in the set of variables and states. As previously argued, this difference may be due to the Influenza vaccination provided by SUS every year for vulnerable groups. As the vaccine is free and is systematically provided by SUS, the existing inequalities measured by HDI are not highlighted in Influenza, in an opposite way of what J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f happens in the case of COVID-19, for which no vaccine is available yet. However, other inequalities such as access to clean water supply is a risk factor.Temperature and Humidity are factors significantly associated with both diseases, which suggests that seasonality may be a factor attributable to both viruses. This explains the high number of cases in the tropical climate.The exposure-response curves for COVID-19 and Influenza at lag 3 for maximum temperature and relative humidity for AM (tropical climate) and PR (subtropical climate) are presented in Temperature presents similarities in the risks for COVID-19 (Fig 6 a and b) and Influenza (Fig 6   c and d) , with a risk factor above percentile 75 th for both diseases. Humidity is also observed in having the same way, as can be seen on exposure-response curves for AM (Fig. 6) . The same result is observed in the case of PR for both diseases. However, for humidity, these similarities in the curves are not so clear, but the risk is around the mean (Tables 2 and 3 ) and a protective factor is observed between 25 th and 75 th percentiles for influenza and 75 th and 99 th percentiles for COVID-19. Anyway, it is important to note that the COVID-19 period in PR presented atypical meteorological conditions (drier) concerning the climatology of the corresponding period. seasonality; temperature and humidity are the main related atmospheric variables. Therefore, we believe that COVID-19 also has a similar annual cycle like Influenza, with tropical regions presenting a different cycle than subtropical regions, since the variability of temperature and humidity is significantly different between these regions.In this study, we evaluated the influence of atmospheric and socio-economic conditions on the spread of COVID-19 and Influenza in tropical and subtropical states in Brazil. COVID-19presented a different epidemiological profile in tropical and subtropical Brazilian climates.Seasonality showed similarities with the behavior of Influenza in previous years. Despite the relevance of social distancing, indicated in this study by mobility, the climate had an important influence on both COVID-19 and Influenza suggesting that, for the tropical region (AM, MA, and CE), COVID-19 arrived in a favorable time. This favorable climate condition, identified by an abnormal rainy season that influenced humidity, was observed mainly in AM and MA and may have contributed to a large number of cases. On the other hand, COVID-19 arrived in unfavorable periods and atypical meteorological conditions for PR state, i.e. under much drier and sunnier conditions than normal, with several hours of solar radiation that contributed to the control of COVID-19 spread in the state.Age is the most important risk factor for influenza, while for COVID-19 the HDI is the most important factor to explain the differences among regions in the number of COVID-19 cases followed by age and social distancing.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Finally, the dataset has limitations associated with sub notifications of cases and deaths by COVID-19. Similar limitations can be extended to the social distancing measure, analyzed through the mobility changes since it cannot represent with accuracy how far people are staying away from each other. Besides, hospital admission for influenza obtained from SUS cannot represent the total population, as well as the data available for COVID-19 that is yet limited to a few months, which can influence the results. However, we believe that these results can be extended to other similar regions and call attention to the influence of socioeconomic inequalities on the spread of the pandemic.",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-16,9
ac016b052bccb74eb5028fdcc32429002a14ae37,"Assessing the spread of COVID-19 in Brazil: Mobility, morbidity and social vulnerability","As of 21 March 2020, the pandemic of COVID-19 had reached 184 countries with 266,073 confirmed cases and 11,184 deaths, globally [1] . The first imported case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Brazil on February 26, 2020, in the city of São Paulo [2] , only two months after the alert on COVID-19 went off in China. At this date, all twenty seven federative units had reported suspect cases of COVID-19 infection, while 16 states and the Federal District had confirmed 1128 cases (11, 278 under investigation) and 18 deaths [3] .São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states identified virus community transmission on March 13, 2020 [4] [5] [6] . Just four days later, 240 cases were confirmed in São Paulo, with 4 deaths [3] . In Rio de Janeiro, 45 cases had been confirmed with no reported death. São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states hold the most populous metropolitan areas of Brazil, where a large fraction of the population live in crowded neighborhoods with poor housing and low income. They are the country's main hubs for national and international transportation. It is known that other pathogens such as Influenza A H1N1, in 2009, have been introduced in the country through these hubs [7] . In March 2020, when the epidemic was still confined to Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, we estimated the pattern of COVID-19 spreading risk within Brazil, taking the states of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo as the starting points. In our analysis, we considered a worst case scenario in which there would be no implementation of mobility restrictions. At that moment, mobility restrictions and social distance were starting to be adopted, but it was not clear whether the population would adhere to them.Brazil is a continental country with strong spatial heterogeneities in terms of demography, age distribution, access to public health, and socioeconomic indexes. Because of these inequalities, the COVID-19 epidemic should impact these populations differently. To identify regions with high geographical and social vulnerability, we proposed a classification scheme based on three main criteria: population mobility, socio-demographic-economic characteristics, and the available health care infrastructure in terms of hospital capacity.Brazil is divided into 558 micro-regional administrative units, with population sizes varying from 13 million people in the metropolitan area of São Paulo to 2, 703 in Fernando de Noronha island, in Pernambuco.To measure mobility intensity between micro-regions, we used daily air travel statistics from the Official Airline Guide (OAG) [8] . This dataset contains the number of travels per origin-destination airport. Data on shorter distance pendular travels motivated by work and study activities were obtained from the 2010 national census (IBGE) [9] .Demographic data from the 2000 and 2010 national censuses [9] were used to project the population per age group in 2020 using a geometric growth model. Socioeconomic indicators were obtained from the same source: infant mortality, life expectancy, GINI index, human development index (education, longevity and income), proportion of individuals below the poverty threshold, proportion below the extreme poverty threshold, 25% percentile income, percentage of urban population, percentage of the population in households with piped water, % of population with insufficient water supply and precarious sewage disposal, and percentage of individuals in households without electricity.Data on health care capacity per micro-region were obtained from DataSUS [10] . From these data, we calculated the number of standard hospital beds and number of complementary beds (Intensive Care Unit and Intermediate Unit) available for each micro-region [10] , aggregating those from the public sector (SUS) and private (non-SUS) sector. The final indicator is given by 10, 000 inhabitants.Number of COVID-19 cases notified per day was obtained from the site brasil.io/dataset/ covid19/casofull. This site aggregates official notification data reported by each state.To assess the probability of COVID-19 spreading within Brazil, in the absence of mobility restrictions, we first calculated the effective distance (E f (i,j)) between micro-regions using the air travel data. Due to the continental size of Brazil, daily interstate mobility between major urban centers is mainly composed by air travel. Therefore, interstate dispersion of the disease during the initial phase of the epidemic is assumed to be driven mainly by air-travel. We computed the effective distance, E f (i,j), between each micro-region and the two COVID-19's hotspots, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. E f (i,j) is a measure of proximity between micro-regions i and j created by the flow of travellers. This metric is known to be strongly correlated with the time it takes to import infectious diseases into new territories from a well-defined origin, particularly for diseases with direct transmission [11, 12] . We computed E f from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro separately in order to assess the potential contribution of each one.To facilitate comparison between different scenarios, we also calculated a relative effective distance (e f ), by dividing E f by the distance to the nearest destination: e f (i,j) = E f (i,j)/min j {E f (i, j)}. This information was mapped into micro-region origin-destination pairs by summing over the corresponding airports serving each micro-region based on its municipality of reference.To calculate the probability of outbreak in each micro-region m, we used the standard expression: [13] . This expression comes from the stochastic SIR model, where the probability of extinction of an outbreak is given by ð1=R 0 Þ I 0 where I 0 is the initial number of infected when R 0 > 1. Thus, the complement of this probability is the probability of the epidemic taking hold in the population (see [13] , p.106 for a derivation). The prevalence of infection, I m , is estimated asis the number of travelers with COVID-19 arriving from micro-region i to micro-region m while I m is the product of the fractional prevalence I i /N i times the infection duration τ (assumed equal for all infected) and a scaling parameter k, to account for the number of undetected asymptomatic individuals participating in the transmission. The parameter R 0 is the basic reproduction number [13] . For the purpose of the results shown, we set R 0 = 2.5, which is compatible with previous studies [14] [15] [16] [17] . S1 We computed the outbreak probability per micro-region using two consecutive time windows representing two generations of spread:First generation of outbreaks. We assumed that community transmission has been reached when the count of cases was 100 cases. We selected only Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo as the source municipalities which were the two initial COVID-19 hotspots. Prevalence of infection was calculated by multiplying the notification count by an expansion factor k = 10 to take into account asymptomatic and unreported cases [18] . This number is then multiplied by the average duration of infection τ = 8 days [19] , resulting in 8000 prevalent infections (infected × infection duration) in each of the two cities of origin.The number of travelers per day between micro-regions was computed by adding the number of air travellers (used to calculate effective distance) and the number of pendular commuters Census [9] . The inclusion of pendular mobility was important to allow spreading between geographically close micro-regions, while still preserving data-driven flow estimates.Second generation of outbreaks. In this scenario, we assumed that enough time had passed so that all micro-regions with p epi � 0.5 in the first scenario actually had developed community transmission (epidemic). In each of the new hotspots, the prevalence is set to the same level adopted before for Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo micro-regions. Then we computed p epi again, to identify the micro-regions most likely to develop outbreaks in this second round. These generations of outbreaks should not be confused with generations of infections within a city.The above mentioned scenarios do not take into account any intervention affecting mobility, nor demographic and environmental effects that may play a role on the magnitude of R 0 . Social vulnerability. Partitioning cluster analysis (k-medoid) was performed to identify micro-regions with similar social vulnerability. This method is a more robust variation of the standard k-means. The first step was the removal of highly linearly correlated variables (Pearson's correlation > 0.8): infant mortality, human development index (longevity and income), proportion of individuals below the poverty threshold, 25% percentile income, percentage of urban population. The following ones remained: life expectancy, GINI index, education component of the human development index, proportion of the population living below the extreme poverty threshold, percentage of urban population, percentage of the population in households with piped water, percentage of population with insufficient water supply and precarious sewage disposal, and percentage of individuals without electricity. The elbow method was used to estimate the number of clusters [20, 21] . More information on this analysis can be found in the S2 Supplement Material. The analysis was done using the R environment [22] , packages cluster [23] , corrplot [24] , FactoMineR [25] , factoextra [20] . Recife and Salvador, among others. A more complete list is found in the S1 Supporting Information .  Fig 1(d) shows the probability of outbreak in a secondary round of propagation, conditioned to the establishment of transmission in the micro-regions with highest risk (p > 0.5) during the first phase. In this second moment, the establishment of COVID-19 transmission is very likely along the coast, from Porto Alegre (in the South) to Salvador (Northeast). Other high risk areas are the neighboring areas of Recife and Fortaleza (Northeast), the neighboring areas of Foz do Iguaçu, in the western border of Paraná state, and the neighboring areas of Cuiabá, Brasilia, and Goiânia in the Center-West.We identified five classes of social vulnerability, tentatively ordered from A (least vulnerable) to D-E (most vulnerable). Table 1 shows the averages of the socioeconomic indexes for each class, from which we propose the following interpretation. The Supporting information file S2 has more detailed description of the analysis. Class A. Mostly urban micro-regions, with above-average life expectancy, with comparatively less social inequality, less population living in extreme poverty, better access to water supply and sewage disposal services, higher education. They are the largest cities and in the central region.Class B. Very similar to A in life expectancy. Still more urban, but with more population living in extreme poverty (mean = 5%). Inequality indexes and infrastructure are worse in comparison to A, but still above average. These are found in the South, Southeast, and Central regions.Class C. Mixture or urban and rural populations. In comparison to A and B, they have significantly lower life expectancy, significantly high poverty and less infrastructure. They are the most urbanized areas of the Northeast region. Manaus, capital of the Amazonas state in the North region, is also in this category.Class D. Predominance of rural populations, high inequality, low HDIedu, poor access to water and sewage services, but with access to electricity. These are mainly located in the dry Caatinga biome area of the Northeast.Class E. Predominantly rural regions in the Amazon. Low HDIedu, poor access to treated water, sewage disposal, and electricity. Fig 2 shows four maps that synthesize the main vulnerabilities to COVID-19 in Brazil in March 21th. Fig 2(A) shows a strong difference in age structure, with the proportion of individuals with 60 or more years of age varying from only 3% in the North to more than 15% in the Southern part (Fig 2(A) .Fig 2(C) shows micro-regions with similar social vulnerability indexes. Micro-regions in the C, D and E classes are the most vulnerable. They are located mostly in the Northeast and North regions. As expected, higher life expectancy is associated with better living conditions, significantly concentrated in the Southern portion of the country. Hospital capacity is very heterogeneous, the best capacity found in large metropolitan areas. There are under-equipped micro-regions throughout the country but they concentrate in the North and Northeast. Fig 2(D) highlights the micro-regions with high probability of imminent outbreak (p out > 0.5 on the second wave) and high social vulnerability. They are important targets for immediate attention in terms of local socio-economic factors (S1 File).In the absence of strong mobility restrictions, the fast establishment of COVID-19 outbreaks in the larger urban areas of the country was found to be highly likely, with subsequent spread to their vicinity municipalities. The time scale of this spread is not explicitly represented in the model, but it was expected to be a matter of a few weeks considering the short serial interval of Life expect. = life expectancy (age), GINI, poverty = % living in extreme poverty, water = % individuals without access to piped water, sewage = % population with insufficient water supply and precarious sewage disposal, electricity = % individuals in households without electricity, urban = % living in cities.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238214.t001 this infection. The implementation of mobility restrictions could delay this spread but it was unlikely to change the routes of the travelling wave. The analysis of COVID-19 spread using the mobility flows and probabilities of the epidemic taking off, were subjected to uncertainties in both mobility and epidemiological parameters available at the time they were calculated. Nevertheless their utility at the time was not diminished by this uncertainty since the parameters were chosen to represent a somewhat extreme scenario, which the country could still strive to avoid. Other uncertainties expected to limit the accuracy of the results were the lack of an accurate value for the infectious period of COVID-19 and the lack of knowledge about early changes in mobility resulting from news of the pandemic already circulating through the country. Social distancing was one of the main strategies put in place to delay transmission. This was expected to be difficult to achieve in areas with high social vulnerability where poor living conditions make it difficult to adhere to hygiene and isolation protocols. Even in the A vulnerability class, the success of this strategy requires adaptation to cope with the large inequality within the municipalities of each micro-region. The classification proposed here was developed to help to tailor the mitigation protocols to the needs and possibilities of the different regions.It was clear the great heterogeneity in hospital capacity across the country. The median number of hospital beds was 19 per 10,000, but 5% of the micro-regions have only 6 beds per 10,000. This disparity poses an important challenge for resource allocation, and should be addressed specially in those municipalities combining high probability to early spread, relatively high percentage of individuals above 60 years old, and limited number of hospital beds per 10,000 people. All discussions about the time to overload of the health system should take into consideration the regular level of occupancy of hospital beds in each region, which was not available for this analysis.The regions in the North and Northeast of the country were those identified with the highest socioeconomic vulnerabilities. These areas were expected to suffer above average burden if measures were not taken quickly, since the eventual disease spread would add to struggles already present in those populations.All the analyses proposed and applied here focused on being able to rank regions in terms of the seriousness of the health crisis looming over them. As such, their main limitation is that they yield relative results, allowing for optimal resource allocation, but not for accurately predicting number of cases and deaths. Further exploration of this model could include Monte Carlo methods to identify uncertainties regarding different trajectories of disease spread in the first and second round of propagation.When this analysis was sent to public health authorities in the form of a report, we hoped it could help health authorities and decision-makers regarding the best course of action and how to better allocate their resources. One application was the identification of indigenous populations in Brazil at imminent risk. In response, the indigenous communities organized themselves and in collaboration with other organizations, prepared a document for the UN. These subsequent reports are available in covid-19.procc.fiocruz.br.In 9th July 2020, 110 days after the analysis here presented was finished, the paper was still under revision. During this period, SARS-CoV-2 spreaded throughout Brazil, causing 1.72 million confirmed cases and 68055 deaths. So, we extended this paper, giving an update of the situation, to compare our predictions with what happened.After Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, the next cities to reach three figures in their reported cases where Belo Horizonte/MG, Brasília/DF, Porto Alegre/RS, Salvador/BA and Fortaleza/ CE. These cities have small effective distances to Sao Paulo, and for that reason, with high probability of outbreak according to our models (S1, S3, S4 Figs). Fast contamination of cities directly connected by road to Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro was also observed, mainly to the former. One month later, by the end of May, COVID-19 activity was already present in many cities along the coast as expected. These patterns had been predicted by the model.We detected that micro-regions in the Northeast, in particular Ceará and Bahia, should receive attention due to the synergistic effect of geographical and social vulnerabilities on the magnitude of the COVID-19 public health crisis. Ceará was later strongly hit by the epidemic and had to implement lock down measures when hospital beds became unavailable.Our model underestimed the spread of the epidemic within the Amazon region. This is due to the fact that human mobility by boat, the main mode of travel in the region, was not well represented in our mobility matrix. Thus, we did not predict the fast spread to communities along the Amazon river between Manaus and Belem.Knowing in advance which regions could potentially suffer the biggest hit first might have allowed authorities to opt for preemptive differential investments to the public health care system (SUS) in these regions. Unfortunately, the initial efforts by the government to allocate resources in a rational way was not timely enough and was eventually interrupted by political and economic reasons.

3669cf084358c7b6351491c27ee97c67bd0aa9bd,"Seroprevalence and seroconversion rates to SARS-CoV-2 in interns, residents, and medical doctors in a","Latin America was one of the most severely compromised regions of the world during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, between June and August 2020.Healthcare workers are at increased risk for COVID-19 and studies of seroprevalence and seroconversion rates in these subjects have not been published in the area.We conducted a cross-sectional and prospective study of medical doctors and medical trainees in a University Hosptial during June, July, and August 2020 to assess seroprevalence and seroconversion rates of SARS-CoV-2 in this population, using a Chemiluminescent assay (CLA). In all, 29 (8.26% 95%CI 5.81-11.61%) individuals had IgG for SARS-CoV-2 by CLA and of these 11 (3.13% 95%CI 1.76-5.52%) were asymptomatic.Our report is one of the first in Latina America on seroprevalence and seroconversion rates in medical healthcare workers. It emphasizes the importance of avoiding focusing only on symptomatic individuals to screen this population for SARS-CoV-2 infection, since of all individuals that have evidence of previous infection many (37.93%) may be pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic and may contribute to infection/disease spread.During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic healthcare workers (HCW) have been shown to have an increased risk of infection [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Studies in this population in many parts of the world have shown seroprevalences of between 2.4% and 45%, and in general above that of the general population and varing according to multiple factors [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . In asymptomatic HCW, at the peak of the pandemic in England, a global seroprevalence rate of 24.4% was found [7] . Furthermore, individuals who retrospectively reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19 had a higher seroprevalence rate than those who did not report them, in this study and other studies [6, 7] . Although retrospective reporting of symptoms may have evocation bias, these findings indicates that, in the context of COVID-19 a relationship can be established between retrospectively reported symptoms and seroprevalence. Seroconversion rates in HCW have been reported in fewer studies and varied between 20-44% in short term followup during high circulation of SARS-CoV-2 [1, 8] .The main purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibodies, and the seroconversion rates to SARS-CoV-2 in a month of follow-up of interns, residents, and medical doctors of the School of Medicine of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana attending patients at HUSI.In a second step, a prospective study was conducted to determine the incidence of seroconversion two weeks and a month of follow-up after baseline visit among the seronegative individuals from the cross-sectional study.As secondary objectives, we aimed to assess the relation between seropositivity either at baseline or during follow-up and risk factors and symptoms compatible with COVID-19. Finally, as an exploratory objective, we examined the concordance of CLA IgG as a tempative gold standard with the LFA IgG and IgM and ELFA IgM and concordance of the ELFA IgM and LFA IgM.At the HUSI's clinical laboratory, individuals updated the survey of clinical symptoms compatible with COVID-19, signed an electronic informed consent, and donated 7 ml of venous blood.SARS-CoV-2 IgG tests (Abbott Colombia) were performed on an Abbott Architect i1000 analyzer, following the manufacturer's protocol. A single lot of positive and negative controls were run at the start of each batch of antibody testing. Samples with a signalto-cutoff (S/CO) ratio greater than or equal to 1.4 were considered positive.Gyeonggi-do, Korea) were performed following the manufacturer's protocols. Positive results were determined by the appearance of a visible band in the designated area, simultaneously with an appropriate positive control band.The VIDAS Anti-SARS CoV-2 IgM two-step sandwich ELFA was performed on a VIDAS analyzer (BioMérieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France). An index is calculated as the ratio between the relative fluorescence value measured in the sample and the relative fluorescence obtained for a calibrator (humanized recombinant anti-SARS CoV-2 IgM) and interpreted as negative (index<1) or positive (index≥1) [17] .All assays were validated with serum samples from PCR+/-individuals in our laboratoryThe data was exported and analyzed in Stata 14. We conducted a descriptive analysis of the demographic characteristics of the study participants, according to the seropositivity. Continuous variables were described using median and interquartile range (percentiles 25th and 75th) and categorical variables were described using absolute and relative frequencies.Second, we examined the relation between seropositivity either at baseline or during the follow-up and risk factors and symptoms compatible with COVID-19, we estimated the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval using logistic regression Third, we assessed the concordance of CLA IgG, as a tempative gold standard, with LFA IgG and IgM and ELFA IgM, and the concordance of ELFA IgM and LFA IgM, using the Cohen's kappa and the corresponding 95% confidence interval.Individuals in our cohort were bled at baseline between June 25 and the 4 of July. At baseline 8 (2.28% 95%CI 1.16-4.43%) individuals were SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive by CLA (Table 1 and Figure 2 ). For comparison, we also measured IgG and IgM antibodies by LFA ( Table 1 ) and found that six individuals of the eight indivuals were also positive for IgM and IgG by LFA. Of these six individuals, one had COVID-19 compatible symptoms and a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 by PCR, two had previously been hospitalized with clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 (with negative PCR but positive serology), one had a positive PCR but had remained asymptomatic, and two without history of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were also asymptomatic (Tables 1 and 2 ).Finally, one asymptomatic and one symptomatic individual were positive for IgG by CLA, but negative for LFA antibodies ( Table 2 ). In addition, 18 individuals were only positive for SARS-CoV-2 LFA IgM and one was only positive for LFA IgG ( Table 1) . One of the 18 individuals that was only positive for IgM had a history of previous COVID-19 symptoms and a positive PCR before joining the study (Tables 1 and 2 ). The majority of individuals (16/18) with only a positive LFA IgM result and tested for SARS-CoV-2 PCR were negative for PCR at a date close to the date when the antibody sample was obtained ( Table 2 ). Somewhat unexpectedly, three of the eight individuals that declared having a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR previous to the start of the study were negative for all of the antibodies measured (Data not shown).A second and third blood samples was taken approximately two weeks ) and one month (28.7 days 95%CI 28.3-29.0) after baseline for each individual, from the 9th-21st of June and from June 23 to August 10, respectively.Three hundred and thirty-five (335) Figure 2 ). Three of these nine individuals were asymptomatic. None of the previously IgM positive individuals by LFA or the individual that only was IgG positive by LFA seroconverted by CLA IgG (Table 1) (Table 1) , with one individual scoring marginally below the cutoff level of the assay ( Figure 2 ). All nine individuals that seroconverted in IgG CLA in the second bleed remained positive and 12 new individuals (3.93% 95%CI 2.31-6.61%) seroconverted.Demographic, infection risk factors, and prevalence of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 for this population are presented in Table 3 for individuals with or without a positive SARS-CoV-2 CLA test in the study. No risk factors were associated with seroprevalence or seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2.To further evaluate concordance of the LFA and CLA assays and to extend this analysis to ELFA IgM, thawed samples from the first bleed were tested by ELFA and thawed samples from bleeds 2 and 3 were tested by ELFA IgM and LFA IgG and IgM.Concordance of CLA IgG with LFA IgG and ELFA IgG was moderate and with LFA IgM, minimal (Table 4 ) [18] . The ELFA IgM and LFA IgM also had minimal concordance (Table 5 ).Concordance of CLA IgG with LFA IgG and ELFA IgG was moderate and with LFA IgM, minimal ( Table 4 ). The ELFA IgM and LFA IgM also had minimal concordance ( Table   5 ).The levels of seroprevalence for CLA IgG (2.28%) at the beginning of the study and of seroconversion to this antibody (5.98%) are comparable to those reported in other studies and, overall, higher than those observed in the general population [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . In a comparable study in England that followed 200 front line HCW for two weeks, they found that 20% of them seroconverted during the study, but 25% were already seropositive at the beginning of the study [1] . Most likely, the higher numbers in the English study compared with our study are due to the differences in the populations studied (front line workers vs a mixed population of medical doctors).One of the main findings of our study, is the relatively high numbers (3.18%) of asymptomatic individuals positive for IgG by CLA (Table 1 ). This number is very close to the number of asymptomatic HCW detected by screening with PCR in nasofaringeal swabs (3%) [19] or saliva (2,6%) [20] in England. Although it is incompletely clear how much pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals contribute to virus spread, focusing only on stopping symptomatic individuals is insufficient to control the spread of the virus [21, 22] . None-invasive rapid screening strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection are needed to evaluate symptomatic and asymptomatic HCW.Our results seem comparable to previous studies in which the CLA test that we used showed a sensitivity and specificity close to 100% when compared with PCR +/samples [23] [24] [25] , while the LFA [26] and the ELFA [17] appear to be less sensitive and (Table 1) .However, none of these individuals had a positive PCR at or close to the time when the sample was taken (Table 3) . With few exceptions, they did not present with COVID-19We want to thank the volunteers that participated and donated blood for this study. We want to thank Dr Pablo Aschner for careful reading and suggestion for the project and Madga Alba and Jenny Severiche for help with the process of recruiting volunteer.The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.This study was funded by Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, and Fundación Bolívar Davivienda.(which was not certified by peer review) ",Colombia,abstract,2020-09-18,9
8880bf3e94158ccfa058d5e4a328112fdfae3588,Title: App-based symptom tracking to optimize SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy using machine learning,"The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 requires extensive testing programs to understand the transmission, diagnose, and isolate the positive cases. Given the high mortality and absence of a specific consensual treatment or a reliable vaccine, large testing programs are an essential part of epidemic control. The frequency of testing, however, is very heterogeneous among countries. Brazil currently has the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases, even with lower test rates (59,252 tests per one million inhabitants, as of July 27, 2020) [1] .In a recent paper, Menni and colleagues [2] used information from an app-based symptom tracker from UK and USA and concluded that the combination of symptoms could be used as a screening tool to identify people with a possible positive result for COVID-19.However, little is known about this association and their potential usage as a screening tool in low-and medium-income countries (LMIC) such as Brazil. Thus, our study aims to use the combination of symptoms and machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model that identifies people and areas with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used data from an app-based symptom tracker known as ""Dados do Bem"" [3] , which is an initiative that started available for the state of Rio de Janeiro, one of the centers of the outbreak in the country.Applying our model, we can estimate the proportion of infected participants and then categorize risk levels of infection within the geographical area of the state of Rio de Janeiro, aiming to prioritize tests and optimize the testing program.This study is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from individuals registered in the ""Dados do Bem"" app, which is a large Brazilian initiative that combines an app-based symptom tracker and a public testing initiative for the users. The app interface and the survey questions are provided as supporting information (S1 Fig). The free smartphone application was launched in Brazil on April 28, 2020. Through a short survey, it collects geo-referenced data from subscribed users, their demographic and occupational characteristics, reported symptoms, as well as whether the participant is a health professional or was in contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infected person. The app then combines the surveyed information and selects individuals for testing. The test used is the antibody WondfoCOVID-19 IgM/IgG test (sensitivity = 86.43%, specificity = 99.57%) [4] and is currently available only for the state of Rio de Janeiro.We included participants registered through the smartphone app from its launch date until July 16, 2020, separating them into two groups: those already selected and tested for the antibody WondfoCOVID-19 IgM/IgG test, and those who responded to the questionnaire but were not tested yet. The tests of the first group were performed in a location designated by the app within the city of Rio de Janeiro. We excluded users whose test results were inconclusive.Our primary outcome was the test result (positive or negative) at the user level. Our goal was to identify clinical manifestations and individual factors associated with positive testing. Hence, we collected and assessed participant demographics (age, gender), nine symptoms (loss of smell or anosmia, fever, myalgia, cough, nausea, shortness of breath, diarrhea, coryza, and sore throat), and whether the user lives together with someone with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.We described the characteristics and symptoms of positive and negative tested participants, displaying the mean and standard deviation for continuous variables and the frequency for categorical variables. We then analyzed the individual association between symptoms and the test result using a logistic regression model adjusted to age and gender. We provided the corresponding Odds Ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval.The dataset was randomly divided into training and test sets (ratio: 80:20). During model training, for each combination of machine learning and data balancing techniques, we applied grid-search hyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation, using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) as the target metric. We comparatively evaluated the models' performance in the test set and selected the one with the highest Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) [5] value. The cut-off point for predicted values was 50% (i.e., participants with a probability higher than 50% were classified as ""positive"", and ""negative"" otherwise). After our final model was incorporated by the ""Dados do Bem"" app, we performed an external validation using data from users in the state of Goias.Finally, we evaluated the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection risks over the geographic area of the state of Rio de Janeiro modeled as a grid map (each grid is a 400m x 400m square area). Along with the participants with confirmed test results, we applied the chosen model to the sample of participants that had not been tested to obtain their estimated test result. We then calculated the proportion of estimated SARS-CoV-2 infections for each grid according to Equation 1.To avoid misinterpreting proportions in grids with scarce data, we considered grids with at least 10 participants (~94% of all observations). Then, we evaluated the distribution of the grid risks among all grids and classified them into five risk groups using the mean ± 0.5 and 1.5 standard deviations (SD) as thresholds: ""very low"" (< mean-1.5*SD), ""low"" (from mean-1.5*SD to mean-0.5*SD), ""medium"" (from mean-0.5*SD to mean+0.5*SD), ""high"" (from mean+0.5*SD to mean+1.5*SD), and ""very high risk"" (>mean+1.5*SD). Using this classification, we built a risk map for the state of Rio de Janeiro.All analyses were performed in R 3.6.3, using 'tidyverse' package for data wrangling and plots; and 'caret' for the prediction models, with 'ranger' for Random Forest, 'C50' for Decision Trees, 'xgbTree' for the eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and 'naivebayes' for the Naïve Bayes model.The study is retrospective and had no human interference. All data acquired were anonymized, and the ""Dados do Bem"" app follows the Brazilian General Data Protection Regulation (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados -LGPD). All users provided informed consent of de-identified data-use to non-commercial research upon registration in the app. All answers were optional.The data that support the findings of this study are available from ""Dados do Bem"" but restrictions apply to the availability of these data, which were used under license for the current study, and so are not publicly available. Data are however available from the authors upon reasonable request and with permission of ""Dados do Bem"".From April 28, 2020, to July 16, 2020, 337,435 individuals registered their symptoms through the smartphone app. Of these, 49,721 users were already tested, from which 5,888 (11.8%) received a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 infection.According to the self-reported information (Table 1) , most participants were women (61.9%), health professionals (55.8%), with a median age of 41 years old (IQR: 33-51). Among those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, cough was the most frequent symptom (59.6%), followed by myalgia (57.4%), coryza (56.3%), loss of smell/anosmia (52.9%), and fever (44.8%). When evaluating the association between each symptom and the test result, adjusted for age and gender (Fig 1) , we found a similar result: loss of smell (odds ratio [OR]: 4.6; 95% CI: 4.4 -4.9), fever (OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 2.5 -2.8), and shortness of breath (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.6 -2.7) were associated with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 infection.The ""Dados do Bem"" app incorporated our final model (Equation 2), using it to prioritize users for testing in some Brazilian states. For the external validation of the model, we analyzed the Goias state, where 465 registered users have been tested in 20 days. Of these, 52% had positive results.Extensive testing programs for SARS-CoV-2 are, in general, not available in low-and middle-income countries, conferring the under-reporting of confirmed cases into a problem. A previous study estimated that only 9,2% of the Brazilian cases are being notified [6] .Restricting tests hinders the monitoring of the epidemic progression, resource planning, and evaluation of the effectiveness of the control measures. Besides, it leads to false conclusions that the disease is under control.Since it is not possible to test all individuals, some studies suggest that the combination of symptoms could be used as a screening tool to identify people with potential SARS-CoV-2 infection who could be selected for testing [2, 7] . This can be useful for planning public policies and for preventing the spread of the pandemic. That said, our study used data on individual symptoms and demographics obtained from an app-based system, known as ""Dados do Bem"", to develop a model that predicts individuals with a higher probability of testing positive forSome works criticize the use of symptom-based screening strategies to quantify an individual likelihood of having COVID-19, due to the non-specific nature of some symptoms and the existence of co-infections with other respiratory viruses [8] . However, our results evidenced that such a strategy contributes to optimizing the overall testing strategy. Out of the 287,714 new users still not tested, our model estimated that the virus could infect 99,431 who, therefore, should be prioritized for testing. It reduced the need for extensive testing to only 34.5% of the registered untested users. This is undoubtedly beneficial as a public policy, especially in Brazil, a country with the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases and one of the lowest test rates¹.Our model was incorporated into the app and used to select patients for testing in the state of Goias. Of the first 465 users selected, 52% were tested positive. This positivity rate is extremely high compared to the observed positivity rate without a model (11.8%). It indicates that our model presented an excellent performance, improving the test strategy and selecting the users most likely to be positive in the actual scenario.Menni and colleagues [2, 7] Sebo and colleagues [14] studied a sample of 1,543 primary care patients tested in two laboratories in the Lyon area (France) and found that the two symptoms most strongly associated with a positive test were loss of taste (ageusia) and loss of smell and that the combination of these symptoms resulted in an even stronger association (i.e., the odds of having a positive test were six times greater than the odds of having a negative test). A recent literature review of studies analyzing the presence of loss of taste and smell in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients concluded that, from a total of 10,818 patients, 8,823 presented ageusia (81.6%) and 8,088 presented anosmia (74.8%) [15] . Our results reinforce the literature conclusions about the strong influence of loss of smell.This study presents some limitations. First, the symptoms are self-reported. Hence, the participant may report apparent manifestations of the disease, which may not be precise as physiological evaluation by a physician. Second, we were unable to know when a symptom appeared to indicate the stage of the disease at the testing moment. Third, a non-negligible number of false negatives may be present, considering the sensitivity of the serological test.However, identification of potential clusters and optimization of testing resources using a combination of self-reported symptoms is a viable strategy for many countries. A similar combination of symptoms can explain the SARS-CoV-2 infections in developed countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as in LMIC such as Brazil.",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-03,9
7b1fce07063d4c32de3275cd7d2caa813ab0738a,Cooperative efforts on developing vaccines and therapies for COVID-19 Cooperative efforts for COVID-19,"The estabilishment of the partnership between firms and Institutes of Science and Technology (IST) has brought significant contributions to the transformation of knowledge resulting from technological development. The use of knowledge generated in universities by the productive sector are the driver for the development of new technologies whose transfer consists of a complementary path to reach a higher technological level [1] . From the perspective of Open Innovation (OI), organizations improve their capabilities by combining the internalization and ourtsourcing of resources [2] and establishing partnerships with other firms, customers, suppliers, or IST, which occur at different levels of affinity and complexity.The level of maturity that can be achieved in OI is the strong prioritization of the development of partnerships [3] .Technological cooperation networks, which are formed by groups of heterogeneous organizations [4] , can be understood from the perspective of their structure: a horizontal pattern when partners from different sectors collaborate or a vertical pattern when the actors are from the same production chain [5] [6] . Thus, organizations are grouped based on the formation of partnerships with firms, government agencies, investors, industrial associations, and research institutions [7] . Organizations which are in cooperation networks that are more heterogeneous tend to be associated with better economic performance [8] . In addition, highly clustered communities induce the feeling of trust [9] , which is relevant when a partnership is associated with discoveries commercially attractive and with high profit expectations.Thus, selecting of the best partners is one of the main challenges for the success of businesses in cooperation [10] . A deep understanding of the cooperation networks can be important and can provide insights of the pattern of relationships affecting the innovation performance of their members; however, the overflow of knowledge may not be equally accessible by or appropriate for all members [11] .Thus, regarding the development of drugs for COVID-19, the cooperation networks resulting from clinical trial (CT) may emerge as an essential element, allowing organizations to share their results and fulfill the expectations of the drugs efficacy in a more intensive and rapid manner. The decision on which partner to choose to develop an R&D&I project in this sector are frequently drived by complimentray competences to beat the pandemic faster but also focusing on firms' strategies to optimizing their CT portfolios. Identifying the most promising technology in such a short time compared to traditional regulatory parameters, then scaling them up and distributing these therapies and/or vaccines are a major challenge for investors and firms, regulatory agencies, and academics. In this context, cooperation networks during the pandemic can be perceived as performance indicators when joining capabilities are enforced to fight the disease and provide a solution for the pandemic.Efforts to seek partnerships and create new alliances to fight COVID-19 have brought numerous challenges. There are risks due to the need to redirect the efforts of research teams despite working on the ongoing funding (i.e. for other diseases). There may be delays, discontinuities or even difficulties in maintaining adherence to original protocols, which impairs statistical consistency [12] . Notably, the pressure to obtain rapid results cannot lead to disregard the safety and integrity of the trials; therefore, the organizations involved are seeking maximum effectiveness in the shortest possible time by incorporating knowledge accumulated during other pandemics [13] [14] . In addition, concern regarding the accurate monitoring of numerous CTs while avoiding redundancies has led to the creation, via artificial intelligence, of a real-time dashboard for COVID-19 CTs [15].Given the extent and severity of COVID-19, numerous studies under different perspectives have sought to analyse developments related to the pandemic. However, the dynamics of cooperation, which can accelerate the development of a vaccine or drug that is effective against this disease, have not yet been explored. This study seeks to deply understand the cooperation networks of organizations that have combined efforts to create and test new drugs to fight COVID-19, based on the 415 CT mapped until July 2020.With this purpose, social network analysis (SNA) were used to map the interactions between organizations, understand the determinants of cooperation and to allows the analysis of a significant sample of CT resulting from collaborative development [16] [17] . Notably, within the set of studies on cooperation networks, the adoption of SNA using CT data is a strategy little explored in the literature. Therefore, this study contributes to understand the profile of entities that cooperate the most in a pandemic status and to highlight which This study uses SNA as a method to identify and build cooperation networks for CTs focused on the development of drugs and vaccines for COVID-19. The operational definition of the main constructs used for innovation [4], SNA [18] , and clinical trials [19] are detailed in the supporting material (S1 Appendix). The study used data sources from Bio Century, clinicaltrials.gov, and Policy Cures Research collected until July 10th, 2020.The organizations were classified into firms, universities, hospitals, research institutes (RIs) and government. The categories of clinical trials were grouped into eight categories (S1 Table) . The sponsors, which are organizations that provide funding, were excluded from the networks because their participation was assumed to occur only through funding and not in the technological development and trials themselves.For the construction of cooperation networks, it was assumed that organizations signed agreements and/or treaties to develop specific studies, establishing joint ownership of the results and the new drug or vaccine, with the purpose of forming an alliance for innovation [20] . CTs with 2 or more organizations were label standardized and analysed using Gephi for graphical representation and calculation of the network metrics. The connections (edges) refer to the (non-directional) relationship of partnerships in each CT.The Strength of cooperation (SC) was adopted to identify the affinity of the cooperation relationship between two organizations, and the unilateral dependence on a cooperation relationship (UDC) was used to verify the asymmetry collaboration relationship [21] . SC and UDC values vary between 0 and 1, and the results of each relationship are distributed in quartiles (Q) as follows: Q1 = 0 to 0.25; Q2 = 0.26 to 0.5; Q3 = 0.51 to 0.75, and Q4 = 0.76 to 1. To avoid bias in the analysis, one-to-one relationships were suppressed because the metric values would automatically have a maximum value (S2 Appendix). A total of 415 ongoing CTs involving drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 were identified, of which 42% are in cooperation and 58% are being tested by only one organization (without cooperation). The most tested therapeutic categories involve antibodies, vaccines, and proteins, which represent 89% of the total CTs in progress. The following categories stand out based on cooperation relevance (Fig 2) , in decreasing order: siRNA (73%), vaccines (47%), protein-based technologies (45%), nucleic acid-based technologies (43%), antibodies (41%), and cell therapy (36%). Conversely, despite technological effort, only 7% of trials involving small molecules have cooperation on CT (S2 Table) . Notably, organizations seek to accelerate technological development by establishing partnerships [22] . In the case of COVID-19, time is crucial because obtaining effective results can generate a broad competitive advantage in this market, in addition to contributing to the normal resumption of post-pandemic activities. Regarding the distribution of the types of organizations that cooperate by category (Fig 3) , a greater diversity of partnerships was observed in antibodies, followed by vaccines and proteins, because these categories address complex therapies and require complementarity among several disciplines (e.g., adjuvants in Because clinical adoption and commercial success are due to the incorporation degree of existing practices in innovation processes [23] , the diffusion of disruptive technologies in this field may encounter greater challenges. Thus, there may be some difficulties in adhering to technologies involving siRNA because there are few firms with expertise in their development which delays the approval of drugs. It is difficult to correctly deliver siRNA treatments without the drugs being degraded by nuclease enzymes and without promoting side effects [24] . This technological challenge is also observed in treatments involving cell therapy [25] .The general cooperation network is constituted by 177 CTs (Fig 4) , and 407 organizations establish 701 cooperation relationships (S3 Table) , indicating specific partnerships. There are exception for 12 collaboration involved in two CTs and two partnerships involved in three CTs. By dividing the network by technological categories (Fig 5) , 58 connected groups related to technologies involving antibodies were identified. Most of them are hospitals that work together with several organizations, including other hospitals, in the same convalescent plasma CT. In general, these cooperation relationships were carried out mainly by geographic proximity and involving government agencies. Despite increasing globalization, regional action is relevant to innovation networks because it facilitates the exchange of knowledge between organizations [26] . The second largest cluster is vaccines (Fig 6) , formed mainly by CTs between university, firms, and RIs, mainly focused on recombinant DNA, RNA, and live attenuated virus. EpiVax and Tonix Pharma stand out with four partnerships each. Tonix maintains cooperation with the Southern Research Institute and has three other relationships with the University of Alberta, all involving engineered live attenuated virus in the preclinical phase.In turn, EpiVax cooperates with seven organizations, each with a different expertise. Also, in phase III CT is an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate developed by in a partnership with the Butantan Institute in Brazil. The partnership between Pfizer and BioNTech also generates a product based on messenger RNA, which is being tested in a phase II CT in Germany.There are 30 protein-based technologies (Fig 7) which can also include protein subunit vaccines, of which 28 are in the preclinical phase and only two are in phase I CTs.The CT involving SCB-2019, which is also a protein subunit vaccine by Sichuan Clover BioPharma combines the expertise of GSK and Dynavax to increase the immune response of patients. The NVX-CoV2373, a vaccine developed by Novavax is a candidate which include partnerships with PolyPeptide Group, AGC Biologics and Emergent BioSolution to ensure the scaling of compounds necessary for final product development and large-scale manufacturing.These trials show that firms have intensified cooperation relationships to foster a faster response to COVID-19 and ensure product scalability. Among the four CTs involving cell therapy, the Chongging Biotechnology and ImmunCyte (phase I/II) partnership stands out for CAR-modified NK cells, which recognize and eliminate the virus. Intraregional partnerships in China, in the biomedical field, favour technology spillover abroad and the production of innovation [27] .Four firms and one university developed three preclinical trials based on nucleic acids. OntoChem and Anixa Biosciences participate in two trials involving technology that inhibits the ability of the virus to replicate and bind to human cell proteins. Conversely, the University of Columbia, Oncogenuity, and Fortress Biotech use a platform to produce oligomers that can help fight COVID-19 and accelerate the discovery of treatments for new outbreaks.The intense participation of Chinese organizations in COVID-19 CTs is notable, which may represent not only a change in the geographical axis of the development of this type of technology but also the emergence of new players in the fierce biopharmaceutical market. The Chinese firms had also developing the therapeutic strategies before any other country, leading the landscape since the outbreak starts overthere. Furthermore, organizations from countries without rich traditions in this area, based in Eastern Europe and Latin America, have started to participate in this type of development.Some organizations operate in more than one category (Fig 9) , which may be an indication of greater capacity for technological development and partnerships. The choice to cooperate in different fields, with different partners, contributes to expanding the connection of CT development networks for COVID-19, directly interfering in the network metrics, which will imply more relevant nodes. The network metrics (Table SM 3) indicate a low density, with an average and weighted degree with similar values, because only 64 institutions developed at least two CTs.Among these, only 37 institutions have built partnerships with different players. The density of the less explored categories can bring an understanding that there are more connections, but this occurs due to the presence of few actors, requiring fewer connections [28] . The diameter of the overall network is eight connections, which is considered a high value, impacted by organizations that have different partners in more than one CT.Regarding betweenness centrality, which indicates high influence within a network due to the power to mediate relationships, it was found that 38 organizations influence connectivity, including 18 firms, nine universities and eight RIs (Table SM 4 The remaining five organizations with the highest betweenness centrality are interconnected. The University of Oxford has the highest betweenness centrality, as it participates in a CT that brings together 18 other organizations, in addition to acting in two other trials with partners that also positively influence the network connection, e.g.,AstraZeneca. This firm also participates in three CTs and sought to establish more specific partnerships with organizations that have more than one CT in cooperation. The high volume of triangulations of some organizations suggests multiple partnerships with a high impact on centrality and low risk diversification.When analysing the strength of cooperation, of the 700 relationships, 391 (56%) are one-to-one relationships; that is, organizations participating in only one CT and with a single partner. Therefore, for these cases, SC and UDC have the maximum value (1). Furthermore, 94% of the partners have at least one party with a high dependence on the relationship (UDC in Q4). These characteristics of a high degree of cooperation and asymmetry in unilateral dependence can be attributed to partnership models with well-defined specializations between the parties, which occur in extremely competitive environments, corresponding to the current moment of the pandemic.For the other partners (309), SC was found in Q1 only for one relationship, i.e.AstraZeneca and Chinese Academy Sciences, that are developing a neutralizing antibody, referring to the fact that both work independently of each other. The other organizations have a median cooperation affinity, with a tendency to increase. This influences the distribution of quartiles of the UDC, whose predominance in the combinations Q1-Q4 and Q2-Q4 reinforces the dependence asymmetry in the cooperation relationships. This finding is evident when observing the SC and UDC measurements by category and type of organization, where antibodies, vaccines and proteins fit this profile (S5-6 Table) .Among the organizations with greater cooperation in CTs, Vir Biotech stands out with seven trials in progress, of which three focus on siRNA and four focus on antibodies. Vir Biotech showed greater cooperation affinity with GSK for antibodies (SC = 0.44) andAlnylam Pharma for siRNA (SC = 0.65). Despite this greater affinity, Vir Biotech has a low dependence on the relationship, unlike the other two partners, who have a high dependence.Johns Hopkins University, with four trials involving antibodies, one involving proteins, and one involving a vaccine, shows a greater cooperation affinity with Capricor (SC = 0.58) and has a low UDC (0.33), while its partner has a relationship of total dependence in this category.Another organization that stands out in this analysis is EpiVax, with six ongoing trials, of which five involve vaccines and one involves a protein, with low affinity with its partners but with dependence on the cooperation relationship. Another characteristic observed is the wide diversity of partnerships between firms, hospitals, RI, and universities. The role of universities has a special meaning, which in the context of a pandemic requires complex research and leads to intensification of partnerships for CT execution, being a complementary way to achieve the desired objetives. Hospitals are also seen as key organizations in this type of partnership in order to enable, quickly and in multiple centers facilitating the testing of new drugs and vaccines. Finally, in the case of firms, they set aside their history of disputes and started to share competences. In this new paradigm, there can be partnerships not only in CT but also in pre-competitive technologies development. This experience is expected to change the way of organizations define their R&D strategies and start to adopt more widely a collaborative innovation model. This study has some limitations due to the availability of information. There is a difference between the quality of information provided by universities and industries. These variations can be perceived according to the geographical locations of organizations and clinical studies. In addition, there is the possibility that some groups may not fully report their status for competitive reasons or overreport to attract more funding. In future research, it is intended to analyze more broadly the process of technological development for drugs and vaccines that will result in disruptive technologies protected by patents, complementing the understanding of different aspects of cooperation in this new context such as the current pandemic.

7a15d5e43249fc7946d74d413b7d0f9a08f7f4c9,,"There is no consensus on what proportion of a population must be infected with SARS-CoV-2 before herd immunity is reached, the threshold above which each infection leaves less than one secondary infection and new cases decline in the absence of other control measures 1 . Estimates of this threshold can help to inform aspects of public health policy, including decisions to reopen society and the roll-out and impact of vaccination campaigns. Given a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.5 4 , the theoretical herd immunity threshold for SARS-CoV-2 under simple epidemiological models is ~60%. However models that account for heterogenous population mixing predict lower values, ranging from 20% 3 to 43% 2 . The herd immunity threshold, together with social distancing and other control measures, determine the final epidemic size.Antibody prevalence studies employ serology testing to measure the proportion of a population with evidence of prior infection. When conducted in a given location, a serial cross-sectional seroprevalence study design can provide empirical evidence of the final epidemic size. Although there have been numerous antibody prevalence studies in Europe and North America, the comparatively low estimates of cumulative infections there (generally <20% 5-7 ) cannot be taken to reflect herd immunity due to the widespread adoption of effective non-pharmaceutical control measures in those locations 8 .In contrast, Brazil has one of the most rapidly-growing COVID-19 epidemics in the world, with the Amazon (Northern Brazil) being the worst hit region 9 . Manaus is the capital of Amazonas state with a population of over two million and population density of 158 inhabitants/km 2 . The first case in Manaus was confirmed on 13 th March 2020 10 and was followed by an explosive epidemic; excess mortality in Manaus in the first week of May was 4.5 times that of the preceding year 11 . The epidemic peak in early May was followed by a sustained drop in cases and deaths despite relaxation of control measures (Table S3) .Although the ideal design to determine prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a populationbased sample, this approach is time consuming and expensive. Routine blood donations can serve as a logistically-tractable alternative [12] [13] [14] . Herein, we present cross-sectional monthly seroprevalence estimates in blood donors in Manaus spanning the first seven months of transmission in Brazil and correlate these findings with the entire epidemic curve in the Amazon region. We compare these estimates with parallel findings from São Paulo (southeast Brazil), where the first COVID-19 cases were detected in Brazil 4, 15 .We used a commercially available chemiluminescence assay (CIMA) that detects IgG antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein (Abbott, Chicago, USA). To infer the true prevalence of infections from antibody prevalence, the sensitivity and specificity of the antibody test need to be accounted for 16 . The specificity of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 CIMA has consistently been shown to be high (>99.0%) 7, 17, 18 . However, the high sensitivity (>90.0%) 7,18 evidenced in previous validation studies was based on severe COVID-19 cases and may not apply to blood donor screening 19, 20 for two reasons. Firstly, most SARS-CoV-2 infections in blood donors are asymptomatic. The weaker antibody response in asymptomatic disease 21 may lead to a lower initial seroconversion rate. Second, due to antibody waning, the sensitivity falls over time after infection 22 . As the case mix varies through the course of an epidemic -proportionally more recent cases at the start with increasingly remote cases through time -the sensitivity will drop as a result of seroreversion (transition from a positive to negative assay result).We used a variety of clinical samples at different time points to gain insight into the dynamics of the anti-N IgG detected by the Abbott CIMA (Fig. 1) . In COVID-19 hospitalized patients at 20-33 days post symptom onset, the sensitivity was 91.8% (95% confidence interval, CI, 80.8% to 96.8%), reflecting high disease severity and optimal timing of blood collection, but also suggesting that ~8% of severe convalescent cases do not develop detectable antibodies. Among a cohort of symptomatic cases with mild disease also tested in the early convalescent period, the sensitivity fell to 84.5% (95%CI 78.7% to 88.9%)indicating initial seroconversion is lower in mild cases. In samples drawn later (50-131 days) from the same cohort, the sensitivity was lower still (80.4%, 95%CI 71.8% to 86.8%), reflecting antibody waning. Indeed, in a subset of 104 patients with two consecutive blood draws, the signal-to-cutoff (S/C) clearly declined over the period observed ( Fig. 1B) and among 88 individuals with a positive reading at the first time point, the mean rate of decay was -0.9 log2 S/C units every 100 days (95%CI -1.1 to -0.75), equating to a half-life of 106 days (95%CI 89 to 132 days) (Fig. 1C ).Finally, we tested 1,000 blood donations given in São Paulo in July 2020 in parallel using a second high-specificity (>99.0% 23 ) immunoassay (Roche Elecsys, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). One-hundred and three samples were positive on the Abbott CIMA and an additional 30 were positive on the second assay. Assuming all 133 samples were true positives the sensitivity of the Abbott N IgG assay was 77.4% (95%CI 69.6% to 83.7%) on asymptomatic blood donor serosurveillance samples. The Roche assay detects total Ig and the signal is more stable than the Abbott assay 22 . As samples in July were donated four months into the on-going epidemic in São Paulo, the false negatives on the Abbott assay include both cases that did not initially seroconvert (""serosilent"" infections), as well as remote infections with subsequent seroreversion.In order to estimate the proportion of the population with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, we used a convenience sample of routine blood donations made at the Fundação Pró-Sangue blood bank in São Paulo and the Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM) in Manaus. The monthly sample size and sampling dates, spanning February to August, are shown in Table 1 . Table 1 also presents the crude monthly antibody prevalence among blood donors; the prevalence re-weighted to the age-sex distribution of each city; and the prevalence following adjustment for test performance, calculated both at the manufacture's threshold (1.4 S/C) and the reduced threshold (0.4 S/C) (see above). Sensitivity adjustments were based on the earlyphase convalescent plasma donors (Fig. 1A) , as these estimates account for initial nonseroconversion before significant antibody waning. We then account for antibody waning using a simple model-based approach (see Methods and Table 1 ). Antibody prevalence according to demographic categories is shown in Table S2 .The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in February and March was low (<1%) in both São Paulo and Manaus. This is consistent with the timing of the first confirmed cases that were diagnosed on 13 th March in Manaus, and on the 25 th of February in São Paulo 10 .In Manaus, after adjustment for the sensitivity and specificity of the test, and re-weighting for age and sex, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was 4.8% (95%CI 3.3%-6.8%) in April, 44.2% (95%CI 39.0%-49.7%) in May, reaching a peak of 51.8% (46.8%-56.8%) in June (Fig. 2) . The increasing seroprevalence closely followed the curve of cumulative deaths. In São Paulo the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in blood donors also increased steadily, reaching 13.6% (12.0%-18.1%) in June.Between June and August, the effect of seroreversion became apparent in both cities. In Manaus, following the peak antibody prevalence in June, the proportion of blood donors testing positive fell to 40.0% in July, and 30.1% in August. Excluding extreme negative samples (<0.4 S/C), the median assay signal fell steadily from May onwards: 3.9 (May), 3.5 (June), 2.3 (July) and 1.7 (August), see Fig. 2B . Similarly, in São Paulo the antibody prevalence remained stable between June and August, while the number of daily COVID-19 deaths also remained relatively stable, reflecting the balance between antibody waning from infection earlier in the outbreak and seroconversion following recent infections (Fig. 2C ).In Manaus, the effect of antibody waning on apparent prevalence was partially ameliorated by reducing the threshold for a positive result from 1.4 S/C to 0.4 S/C and correcting for the resulting increased false-positive rate. However, the results in São Paulo were largely unchanged by this correction (Fig. 2 and Table 1 ).Paulo (C) with a range of corrections. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. Grey bars are standardized daily mortality using confirmed COVID-19 deaths in the SIVEP-Gripe (https://covid.saude.gov.br/) notification system and standardized by the direct method using the total projected Brazilian population for 2020 as the reference. Black lines are the cumulative deaths rescaled so that the maximum is set to the maximum seroprevalence estimate for each city. We further correct for seroreversion with a model-based approach (see Methods for details). Briefly, we assume that the probability of remaining seropositive decays exponentially from the time of recovery. We estimate the decay rate and the proportion of patients that serorevert using the seroprevalence data from Manaus to find the minimum decay rate that minimizes the number of new cases in July and August while avoiding drops in prevalence -i.e. assuming there were few cases in Manaus in July and August and changes in seroprevalence were due mainly to waning antibodies. The results of these corrections are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2 . We find that after adjusting for seroreversion, the cumulative incidence of infections in Manaus may have reached as high as 66.1% (95%CI 60.8%-79.9%). Although this is the minimum prevalence estimate allowed by the exponential decay model, and should therefore be conservative, in the absence of an accepted approach to account for seroreversion, these results should be interpreted with caution. The reliability of this estimate depends on the validity of the exponential decay assumption.In Manaus the overall fatality ratio (IFR) was 0.17% and 0.28%, considering PCR confirmed COVID-19 deaths and probable COVID-19 deaths based on syndromic identification, respectively; whereas in São Paulo, the global IFRs were 0.46% and 0.72%, respectively. The difference may be explained by an older population structure in São Paulo (Fig. S1 ). Supporting this inference, the age-specific IFRs were similar in the two cities, and similar to estimates based on data from Wuhan, China 25 (Fig. S1B ).Our results show that between 44% and 66% of the population of Manaus was infected with SARS-CoV-2 through the course of the epidemic. The lower estimate does not account for false-negative cases or antibody waning; the upper estimate accounts for both. The elevated mortality and the rapid and sustained drop in cases (Figure 2A and S4) suggest population immunity played a significant role in determining the size of the epidemic in Manaus.The non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in the city of Manaus (Table S3) were similar to other cities in Brazil including São Paulo. They were implemented in late March before the epidemic took off. Furthermore, cell phone mobility data showed a marked increase in physical distancing beginning in mid-March, with a similar pattern over time to São Paulo (Fig. S2) . Therefore, it remains unclear what accounted for such rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Manaus. Possible explanations include low socioeconomic conditions, with household crowding 26 , limited access to clean water, and reliance on high-risk boat travel, 9 in which over-crowding results in accelerated contagion, similar to that seen on cruise ships 27 . The young mobile population with potentially low pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 28 , as well as the circulation of multiple virus lineages introduced from multiple locations 10 may have contributed to the large scale of the outbreak.We observed a waning of antibodies following the epidemic peak in Manaus. These findings have significant implications for the design and interpretation of antibody prevalence studies. For the purpose of estimating total cumulative infections in a population, the assay chosen should ideally detect a long-lasting component of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2.Although other assays such as the Roche and Ortho Total Ig assays seem promising in this regard, caution is required before extrapolating data from symptomatic patient cohorts 22 to population surveys, as most infections are asymptomatic in this use case. Despite this limitation of the Abbott assay, one potential advantage to the decay in signal over time is to monitor for reinfections at the population level in the case of a second epidemic wave based on boosting of seroreactivity. Indeed, Manaus may act as a sentinel to determine the longevity of population immunity and frequency of reinfections. An additional strategy to antibody surveillance would be monitoring of local versus imported cases, with a relative increase in local cases suggesting population immunity was no longer preventing onwards transmission.This project was approved by the Brazilian national research ethics committee, CONEP CAAE -30178220.3.1001.0068.This report is part of a wider study (Covid-IgG) monitoring SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among blood donors in eight Brazilian cities (Belo Horizonte, Curitiba, Fortaleza, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, São Paulo and Manaus). The results of this preliminary report are from two participating blood banks: the Fundação Pró-Sangue (FPS) in São Paulo and the Fundação Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM) in Manaus.Both the FPS and HEMOAM blood centers routinely store residual blood samples for six months after donation. In order to cover a period starting from the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in both cities, we retrieved stored samples covering the months of February to May in São Paulo, and February to June in Manaus, at which point testing capacity became available. In subsequent months blood samples were prospectively selected for testing. The monthly target was to test 1,000 samples at each study site. However, due to problems with purchasing the kits, supply chain issues, and the period of test validity, some months were under and others over the target (to avoid wasting kits soon to expire). We aimed to include donations starting from the second week of each month (see Table 1 for exact sampling windows).Part of the remit of the wider project is to develop a system to prospectively select blood donation samples, based on the donor's residential address, so as to capture a spatially representative sample of each participating city. For example, FPS receives blood donations from people living across the whole greater metropolitan region of São Paulo. The spatial distribution of donors does not follow the population density, with some areas over-and others under-represented. We used residential zip codes (recorded routinely at FPS) to select only individuals living within the city of São Paulo. We then further divided the city into 32 regions (subprefeituras) and used their projected population sizes for 2020 to define sampling weights, such that the number of donors selected in any given subprefeitura was proportional to the population size. We piloted this approach in São Paulo and have developed an information system to operationalize this process at the participating center. However, at the time of data collection the system was not implemented in HEMOAM and therefore it was not possible to use this sampling strategy. As such, we simply tested consecutive blood donations, beginning from the second week of each month until the target was reached. The spatial distribution of blood donors tested in the study is shown in Fig. S6 .Although the Abbott CIMA has been validated in a number of studies 1-3 with high specificity (>99.0%) and sensitivity (generally 85-100%), the test characteristicsparticularly sensitivity -are expected to vary with the use case and population in which the test is applied. Most validation studies suffer from spectrum bias, enrolling primarily moderate to severe cases as the positive controls to define sensitivity. This will bias estimates of sensitivity upwards, thus causing an underestimation of cumulative infections after correction for test characteristics.To address this issue, we performed a local validation of the Abbott CIMA on a range of clinical samples. Firstly, we tested samples collected from hospitalized patients with PCRconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at two hospitals in São Paulo (Hospital das Clínicas and Hospital Sírio-Libanês). All samples were collected at least 20 days after symptom onset. Second, we tested a cohort of volunteer convalescent plasma donors that had milder disease, not requiring historical admission. Samples were collected at two time points following symptom onset: first in the early convalescent period, and second at > 2 months POS. Finally, we tested 1000 routine blood donation samples at the FPS from July 2020 using the Abbott assay and the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 electro chemiluminescence assay (ECIMA). In July, the pre-test probability of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in São Paulo was high (>12%) and the Roche ECIMA has a high (>99%) specificity. Therefore, we assumed that any sample that was positive on at least one test to be a true-positive.We sought to quantify the rate of decline of the anti-nucleocapsid IgG antibody that is detected by the Abbott CMIA. We tested paired serum samples from our cohort of convalescent plasma donors (described above). We calculated the rate of signal decay as the difference in log2 S/C between the first and second time points divided by the number of days between the two visits. We used simple linear regression to determine the mean slope and 95% CI.Secondly, we corrected the prevalence with a model-based method assuming that the probability of seroreversion for a given patient decays exponentially with time. We assume that the probability of a recovered individual seroreverting ! months after recovery is The parametersand "" are learned using the measured prevalence in Manaus assuming that there are no new recoveries in July and August.If we denote 6 [7] as the cumulative number of recoveries per capita at month 7, and 8 [7] as the cumulative number of seroreversions per capita, then .In order to estimateand "", we generate all pairs of parameters in the set {0.01, 0.02, … ,0.99} and compute A for each (-, "") using the prevalence data from Manaus.We calculated the global infection fatality ratio in Manaus and São Paulo. The total number of infections was estimated as the product of the population size in each city and the antibody prevalence in June (re-weighted and adjusted for sensitivity and specificity). The number of deaths were taken from the SIVEP-Gripe system, and we used both confirmed COVID-19 deaths, and deaths due to severe acute respiratory syndrome of unknown cause. The latter category likely represents COVID-19 cases in which access to diagnostic testing was limited , and more closely approximate the excess mortality (Fig. S5) . We calculated age-specific infection fatality ratios by assuming equal prevalence across all age groups.We calculated the effective reproduction number for São Paulo and Manaus using the renewal method 9 , with the serial interval as estimated by Ferguson (2020) 10 . Calculations were made using daily severe acute respiratory syndrome cases with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 in the SIVEP-Gripe system. Region-specific delays between the PCR result release and the date of symptom onset were accounted for using the technique proposed by Lawless (1994) 11 .

9778aa7ab9f1728c7c4e27b358c2ddf51c9da552,Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical Is it time to talk about the end of social distancing? A joinpoint analysis of COVID-19 time series in Brazilian capitals,"In December 2019, China released the first report of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 1 . Approximately one month later, World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency, and in March 2020 upgraded the status of the original disease to a pandemic 2 . At the end of June 2020, data showed that more than 10 million people were infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) worldwide and more than 500,000 deaths 3 .The Brazilian Ministry of Health confirmed that the first case of COVID-19 in Latin America occurred in Brazil in late February 4 . Less than a month later, Brazil declared a state of community transmission in the country. The Brazilian Ministry of Health adopted the WHO recommendations to close all public services and kept trade restricted to supermarkets, pharmacies, delivery restaurants, gas stations, and other critical services. Brazil's structure as a federated republic creates relative autonomy for states and municipalities. Thus, social distancing and other COVID-19-related measures were adopted mostly at the state-and city-levels. Therefore, the level of social distancing varies nationwide 5 .Almost four months since the first confirmed case in Brazil, the number of cases and deaths continues to increase. At the subnational level, some areas are still experiencing the initial trend of exponential growth, and some local health systems and funeral services have reached their threshold 6 .Brazil is rife with public disagreements about social distancing and the severity of the quarantine measures adopted by most state governors. The federal government faces an institutional crisis regarding the necessary steps to be taken to protect the population. Simultaneously, the accuracy of the criteria that define COVID-19 cases and deaths is being questioned in the parliament 7 .Meanwhile, some states are planning to relax their quarantine rules despite the collapses experienced by some local health systems. The main argument fueling this decision is that a recent change in the transmission curve has been observed, with a tendency toward stability and decline. Thus, the objective of this study is to describe the behavior of the historical series of COVID-19 cases in Brazilian state capitals and identify changes in the trend over the course of the epidemic. We performed the analysis using case notification data for Brazilian capitals, stratified as epidemiological week. Data were obtained from the Secretaries of Health of each of Brazil's 26 states and the national capital of Brasília. To assess whether the trends changed over time, we used the Joinpoint segmented regression 8 method. This statistical model identifies significant changes in a pattern over a period of time by assuming a trend between inflection points (""joinpoints""). A significant change between one point and the next is assumed to mark an inflection point and the beginning of a new regression trend. One of the advantages of this method is the ability to identify the number and location of changes in the trend, and to estimate the average percent change (APC) for each period defined between inflection points. Joinpoint regression models are particularly useful in evaluating continuity constraint at change points over time. Significant changes in trends are assessed using Monte Carlo approximate permutations to calculate the p value at each time point under the null hypothesis of no change in the trend. We maintained the overall asymptotic significance level to determine where to locate the joinpoints on the time scale through Bonferroni correction of the global alpha level 9 .We used epidemiological weeks as the time unit, from the first 2020 epidemiological week to the 27 th epidemiological week (ending on July 4). We chose to perform the analysis using capitals rather than using federation units (states) to ensure data stability as well as to minimize the effect of inner state heterogeneity. To avoid autocorrelation between the dependent and independent terms of the regression equation, we used a ""week-centered"" variable as the time unit. Moreover, to guarantee the assumption of homoscedasticity, we used Poisson distribution parameters with robust variance. In this way, we adjusted the regression by considering the number of cases weekly as the dependent variable and the centered week as the independent variable. The selection of the number of inflection points was performed automatically by the software. We considered the level of significance at 5%.All capital cities showed an exponential increase in new cases. To date, in most capitals the epidemiological week with the highest case count has been the 22 nd week (May 24th to May 30th). The full pattern of the growth curves, however, varied in each capital. A distinct drop was detected in 20 of the 27 cities (74.1%) and was significant in 8 (Belém, Maceió, Recife, Rio Branco, Rio de Janeiro, São Luís, São Paulo, and Vitória). However, in most cities, the speed (slope) of the decline was much lower than that of the increasing rate before the curve's peak. We can check that looking at the curves (Supplementary material #1) . Finally, it is essential to note that Belo Horizonte and Salvador experienced a renewed increase after a short period of decline ( Table 1) .The study of spatio-temporal patterns can help us understand the mechanisms of disease spread in a population, allowing the detection of behaviors in time and spatial clusters that represent characteristics related to dissemination 10 . Specifically, the use of segmented regression analysis enabled us to identify points in time when the trends changed significantly, generating quantitative hypotheses about changes in the behavior of the pandemic among Brazilian capitals.The rapid increase in COVID-19 clinical cases, characterized by the exponential pattern of the accumulated case curve, suggests that its transmissibility is high, with the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) most likely between two and four 11 . Preventive strategies should aim to reduce this value, and the earlier and more rigorous the adoption of these measures, the more efficient they become 12 .Understanding the stage of the epidemic we are currently in is essential for predicting scenarios 13 . In this regard, it is critical to mention that state governments and their health authorities are under increasing pressure to control the spread of COVID-19, seeking to assess the need for isolation measures and the flexibility of economic activities simultaneously. Therefore, an analysis of time-trend curves helps delineate the best window to identify a phase change in the epidemic. In countries that identified the pandemic early, the slowdown in growth rates was possible owing to the adoption of timely quarantine, rigorous social distancing, and isolation of the affected population 14 . Notably, the epidemic rate evolution in these countries shows two stages of slow down: the first occurs immediately after the adoption of lockdown measures, followed by a second shorter course about two weeks after implementation of these actions 15 . Although the 2-week period is related to the serial interval of the disease rather than a coincidence, the effects of relaxing or strengthening preventive measures are only reflected about two weeks later. Furthermore, even for the capitals with an observed change in the trend, caution is necessary as the changes are very recent, largely without statistical significance and with no evidence that they will be persistent over time.The marked difference between the capitals may reflect differences in the measures adopted and the adherence of the population to those measures. The rate of decline in the curves is less than the rate of increase at the beginning of the epidemic. Any speculation regarding this decline and the use of the information to justify the flexibility and accelerated opening of public activities thus requires caution. The cases of Belo Horizonte and Salvador can be considered, wherein the rate of new infections declined, followed by an increasing rate higher than that in the first phase in short period. Finally, the decreasing trends in the capitals may be an indication of the epidemic's migration to inland cities, The health service network will have to pay careful attention, as most likely, people who have contracted the infection will travel to the capitals for treatment, and without social distancing policies, thousands of susceptible people will be exposed to these cases.Modeling is limited by the availability and quality of data, which in our case was the underreporting of new infections. Lack of tests is a barrier to establish the real number of people infected. The actual number of COVID-19 cases is undoubtedly much higher. Additionally, access to screening tests is different between the capitals 16 . The accuracy of case information depends on many factors such as the availability of screening tests and the speed with which health surveillance programs report suggested cases. Efforts to understand the dynamics of the disease to guide public policies should involve the analysis of existing information 17 .Alfano & Erconalo 18 reported that lockdowns were effective in reducing the number of new cases in the countries that implemented it, especially when considering a 10-20 day gap between the adoption of this strategy and the observed impact on incidence rates. However, some mathematical models suggest that this effect (reduction of case numbers) depends on the percentage of symptomatic cases that exists in the population 19 . Furthermore, evidence indicates that a stepwise implementation of measures that begins with social distancing in the epicenter of the city, followed by the province and the nation, would be practical and cost-effective without requiring a lockdown of the epicenter 20 . Nonetheless, to learn the real number of infections and test these assumptions, mass testing is required and this is a significant conundrum in Brazil.The general recommendation is that the social distancing measures should be gradually eased in regions where the number of cases is few and an efficient public health system that can meet medium and high complexity medical demands such as intensive care units exists. Furthermore, before relaxing these guidelines, the country's testing capacity needs to be substantially increased, considering Brazil's continental dimensions and regional differences, including demographics, climate, urbanization, health care structure, and socioeconomic aspects.The joinpoint analysis only offers a description of the time series, and we did not intend to establish a firm conclusion on social distancing measures based solely on temporal changes. In fact, the results indicate that it is too early to make radical decisions on returning to pre-lockdown activities involving potentially large groups of people. Owing to numerous uncertainties, we consider it helpful to be cautious about returning to activities that would result in several people on the streets. Given the current situation, it would be wise to propose that the social distancing measure remain firm, despite their economic and social repercussions. Lastly, the current phase of the epidemic requires special attention to be paid to the needs of medium-and small-sized cities. ",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-21,9

(do not consider 106 physical therapy)"" and ""During the COVID-19 pandemic how many days a week do you 107 practice any type of physical exercise or sport? (do not consider physical therapy)"". 108Possible answers were: 1) less than 1 day/week; 2) 1-2 days/week; 3) 3-4 days/week; 109 or 4) 5 or more days/week. For those reporting physical activity practice, we also 110 asked: ""How long does this activity last?"". Possible answers were: 1) less than 30 min; 2) 111 30-45 minutes; 3) 46-60 minutes; or 4) more than one hour. We defined ""before the 112 pandemic"" as before the initial restraint measures adopted in Brazil, in the middle of 113March and ""during the pandemic"", as the period in which the participants were 114 completing the questionnaire. We classified physical inactivity using the 115 recommendation of 150 min/week [19] . For our analysis purpose, we created an 116 incidence indicator of physical inactivity, only considering participants who were active 117 before quarantine (those that remained physically active vs. those that became 118 physically inactive during quarantine). 119For TV-viewing, participants were asked: ""Usually, before the pandemic, how 120 many hours a day did you use to spend watching television?"" and ""During the pandemic, 121 how many hours a day have you been watching television?"". Possible answers for both 122 were 1) none; 2) less than 1h/day; 3) between 1 and less than 2 h/day; 4) between 2 123 and less than 3 h/day; 5) between 3 and less than 4 h/day; 6) between 4 and less than 5 124 h/day; 7) between 5 and less than 6 h/day; 8) 6 h/day or more. In addition, 125 computer/tablet use was assessed using two questions ""Usually, before the pandemic, 126 how many hours a day did you use to spend using a computer or tablet?"" and ""During 127 the pandemic, how many hours a day do you usually spend using a computer or tablet?"" 128 with open answers. TV-viewing and computer/tablet use were classified using the cut-129 off point of 4h/day at both moments (before and during quarantine). For our analysis 130 purposes, we considered only TV-viewing and computer/tablet incidence, calculated 131 as: those without high TV-viewing or high computer/tablet use before quarantine 132 (those who maintained low TV-viewing/computer use vs. those who changed to present 133 high TV-viewing/computer use during quarantine). 2) ""a few times"", 3) ""Often"", or 4) ""Always"". We classified as positive for loneliness, 156 sadness, and anxiety those participants who answered ""often"" or ""always"". 157158Covariates 159We used sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during 160 quarantine, skin color and adherence to quarantine as covariates. The highest academic 161 achievement was classified as incomplete high school, complete high school, and college 162 education or more. Working status during quarantine was classified as currently not 163 working, working in a normal routine, and home office. Skin color was classified as 164 white or other. Adherence to quarantine was classified as positive for those only going 165 to grocery stores and pharmacies or staying strictly at home, leaving only for health 166 care needs; and negative for those reporting that they continued a normal life or tried to 167 stay away from people, reducing contact a little, not visiting the elderly, but carrying on 168 working and leaving home as usual. Table 1 . 196Participants who reported worsened sleep quality, and felt loneliness, sadness, and 197 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f anxiety were more frequent within the incidence of physical inactivity, TV-viewing, and 198 computer/tablet use groups. 199 The mediation models of the influence of worsening sleep quality in the 205 association between the incidence of unhealthy movement behaviors and mental health 206 indicators are presented in Table 3 . The incidences of physical inactivity, high TV-207 viewing, and high computer/tablet use were associated with loneliness, sadness, and 208 anxiety feelings. In addition, worsening sleep quality mediated part of the association of 209 the incidence of physical inactivity, high TV-viewing, and high computer/tablet use with 210 loneliness, sadness, and anxiety, with a higher mediation effect for the incidence of high 211 computer/tablet use. 212We aimed to investigate whether changes in sleep quality mediate the associations 215 between the incidence of unhealthy movement behaviors and mental health during 216 COVID-19 quarantine. Our main finding was that worsening sleep quality mediated part 217 of the associations of the incidences of physical inactivity, high TV-viewing, and high 218 computer/tablet use and mental health. In addition, the mediation effect was higher for 219 the association of the incidence of high computer/tablet use with sadness and anxiety. such as sleep apnea, which is associated with lower sleep quality [30] . Similarly, higher 241sedentary behavior, especially screen time can be associated with higher exposure to 242 blue light, which can affect mechanisms related to melatonin release, which is 243 detrimental to sleep quality [31] . In this sense, poorer sleep quality due to the incidence 244 of unhealthy movement behaviors could explain part of the association of the incidence 245 of unhealthy movement behavior and mental health. In addition, the mediation can be 246 explained by sharing some mechanisms, as poorer sleep quality can be associated with 247 higher inflammation, which is associated with poorer mental health indicators [32] [33] [34] . 248We highlight that, to our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the 249 mediation role of worsening sleep quality in the association of the incidence of physical 250 inactivity, high TV-viewing, and high computer/tablet use with mental health during 251 COVID-19 pandemic quarantine.

6d63587f06763423e7929a627b25d4eb00ecbe76,Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG at the epidemic peak in French Guiana,"The world's attention remains focused on the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that causes coronavirus disease 2019 , and the implementation of drastic control measures to limit its expansion. By the end of July 2020, more than 17 million confirmed cases and approximately 650,000 deaths have been reported worldwide [1] . With more than 4,500,000 cases and 190,000 deaths, Latin America has been particularly affected by the crisis [1].A thorough evaluation of the proportion that has already been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and is likely immunized is important to estimate the level of herd immunity of the population [2] and to inform public health decision making. Data on laboratory molecular -confirmed cases do not capture the full extent of viral circulation because a majority of infected individuals have asymptomatic or mild infections and may therefore not seek care [3, 4] . In contrast, population immunity is typically estimated through cross-sectional surveys of representative samples using serological tests. Numerous serological surveys conducted in affected countries at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic indicate that nationwide antibody prevalence varies between 1-10%, with peaks around 10-15% in heavily affected urban areas [5] . Most of the serological studies already available have been carried out in continental Europe [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] and in the United States [13] [14] [15] [16] . Although Latin America has been heavily affected by the pandemic, only a few seroprevalence studies have been conducted across the continent, meaning the underlying level of infection remains largely unknown [5, 17, 18] . French Guiana, a French overseas department with 290,000 inhabitants [19] , located in Latin America in the Amazonian forest complex experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave. A territorywide lockdown was set up from March 17 th 2020 concomitantly with the rest of French territories, at a time when five imported cases and one secondary case were being confirmed on the territory [20] . The lockdown resulted in limited viral transmission until it was ended on May 11th 2020. In the middle of June there was a rapid intensification of viral circulation over a large part of the territory with 917 confirmed cases of COVID-19 detected from March 4 th 2020 to June 11 th 2020 [21]. This was followed by the implementation of strict mitigation measures such as curfews and local lockdowns in the course of June and July. The epidemic peaked at the beginning of July with 4,440 cumulative confirmed cases [22] A cross-sectional survey was performed between 15 July 2020 and 23 July 2020 in 4 medical biology laboratories located in the coastal urban area of French Guiana and in 5 health centers located in isolated areas along the Surinamese and Brazilian borders ( Figure 1 ).All individuals visiting the recruitment centers during the study period were invited to participate to the study, expected those admitted for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing.Publicity and information about the survey was provided at the reception desk of recruitment centers. Fieldworker investigators were trained to explain the project, collect informed consent and carry out the interviews. All individuals visiting the recruitment centers were invited to take part in the study during a preliminary face-to-face interview. For participants under 18 years-old, age-appropriate information was given and the consent of legally responsible person was collected. A specific educational-style comic poster was designed to explain, in an understandable way, the nature and objectives of the survey and inform them about the voluntary nature of the participation of the study.Demographic data, including age, gender, residential region and occupation of each participant, were collected through a standardized questionnaire. Participants were asked to report the occurrence of a presumptive COVID-19 infection, to list the infection associated symptoms and to specify if they had consulted a doctor or obtained a biological confirmation of their infection. Thereafter, a venous blood sample of 3.5mL was collected from each participant, in accordance with current biosafety standards.The study was recorded on Clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT04490850) and approved by the ""CPP EST-III"" Ethical Research Committee (No.CPP 20.07.04-8827; N°ID-RCB 2020-A01826-33). Personal data processing for this study comply with the requirements of the ""reference methodology MR-001"" established by the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) regarding data processing in health research.Blood samples were collected into 3.5 ml gold BD Vacutainer SST II advance tubes with gel for serum separation (Becton-Dickinson, USA). Immediately after puncture, samples were stored at 4°C-8°C until centrifugation within 12 hours. Sera were then frozen and stored at -20°C until used at the National Reference Center for respiratory viruses in Institut Pasteur in French Guiana.if it is performed more than 20 days after infection.In order to obtain population representative estimates of overall seropositivity in the territory we weight each sample by the population size within each municipality, age and sex group. We employ the following notation to describe the study design (Table 1) We enrolled 480 participants between July 15 and July 23, 2020, in 16 municipalities (Table   1 ). The mean age of participants was 38.3 ranging from 0.2 to 87 years old. Comparison of the socio-demographic characteristics of the study sample to the census data demonstrated an over-representation of women (68.1% vs 50% in the general population of French Guiana) and adults over 25 years (79% vs 53% in French Guiana). These differences were corrected in the analyses of seroprevalence and risk factors by allocating a post-stratification weight to each participant.Between July 15 and July 23 2020, the crude proportion seropositive was 13 Since the study was implemented two weeks after the epidemic peak and the sensitivity of the test is limited in the three weeks that follow infection, this likely represents a lower bound for the proportion of individuals infected by the time the epidemic peaked.The seroprevalence did not differ according to gender (p=0.19) or age (p=0.51) ( Table 2 ).In Brazil, one of the bordering countries in French Guiana, seroprevalence estimates varied markedly across the country's cities and regions, from below 1.0% in most cities in the south and center-west regions to up to 25.0% in the city of Breves in the Amazon (North) region [17] . Nevertheless, overall seroprevalence was estimated at 1.4% (95% CI 1.3-1.6 ). In contrast, our findings highlighted high but also relatively homogeneous levels of infection in most municipalities, ranging from 10% to 20%.The case fatality rate of COVID-19 was low during the outbreak as there were 65 COVID-19 related deaths from the beginning of the outbreak up to September 17 [23] across the territory while about 45,000 people have been infected at the beginning of July. These was probably due in part to the young age of the population of French Guiana.Younger populations are likely to have more social ties than older populations, and therefore physical distancing may be more difficult to implement than in countries with ageing populations. Furthermore, since young people are less exposed to disease severity, they may be less likely to adopt physical distancing measures when they are infected and potentially contagious in a context of high level of transmission.represented. However, the municipalities represented by the laboratories and health centers involved in the study are home to 80% of the population, so that our estimates are likely a good reflection of the situation across the territory. We may underestimate infection levels if precarious populations are at higher risk of infection and have limited access to health facilities.Although specificity of the test used in our study is satisfactory according to our internal validation, we cannot rule out the possibility that a proportion of people infected at the beginning of the epidemic i.e. more than 3 months before our survey may have become seronegative [30] . In the other hand, it is possible that infected people did not develop specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies or that these antibodies were not detected by our assay. Since the study was performed shortly after the peak of the epidemic, a proportion of individuals In conclusion, we found that at least 15% of the population in French Guyana was infected by SARS-CoV-2 by the time the epidemic peaked in July. This corresponds to an elevated infection burden given the relatively limited mortality, which can be explained by French Guyana's young population structure. epidemio-regional-hebdomadaire-special-covid-19Santé Publique France.

2106128494aca340368beb40b1100404c7bd6738,Potentials of constrained sliding mode control as an intervention guide to manage COVID19 spread,"Since the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) started spreading around the world. The disease quickly turned into a worldwide health crisis, leading to the World Health Organization to declare the COVID-19 infection a pandemic on March 11th, 2020. Until the submission of this work the COVID-19 disease is affecting 213 countries and territories with more than 25 million reported cases and more than 800 thousand deaths [1] .Vaccines and effective treatments are under development. In the meanwhile, the main strategy to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak has been the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Among them, people confinement and social distancing have been imposed to attenuate the number of infected individuals (i.e. to ""flat the curve""), with the aim of avoiding the saturation of the health systems. In particular, intense care unit (ICU) occupancy levels represent the bounds the governments are more worried about. The NPIs strategies include school and universities closures, social event bans, border closures, work bans for non-essential activities, social distancing, quarantines and lockdowns [2] . Isolation of confirmed cases including tracing and testing the close contacts contributes in reducing the community transmission of the virus. Additionally, the use of technology could provide early identification and monitoring of cases [3] .In Argentina, the first case was reported on March 3rd, 2020. From March 12th, travelers arriving from outside the country were sent to mandatory quarantine. Then, on March 15th a stay-at-home recommendation was emitted including closing schools and universities. Borders were closed on march 16th and other activities like sport and social events were banned. On march 19th, a lockdown was established with exceptions given for workers related to essential activities. This lockdown was extended during the first weeks of April. From then on, the order was lift in those regions of the country less affected and some relaxations were implemented in Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires and its surrounding area (within the region known as AMBA). As of September 1st, more than 400 thousand cases have been reported, including more than 8 thousand deaths [1] . The last available data show that a high percentage of new infections is concentrated in the AMBA. However, as the economical activities are resumed and mobility constraints are relaxed, the number of reported cases in some provinces is increasing.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the SEIR model and the control problem is stated. Section 3 presents the SMRC scheme for NPI computation. Section 4 shows numerical results under different scenarios. Section 5 discusses implementation issues and more realistic simulations are presented. In Section 6 conclusions and future work are outlined.2 Model of infectious disease spread and problem statementThe approach utilized to represent the infectious disease dynamics is a compartmental model with four compartments: Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Removed (Fig. 1) . The parameter β is the average number of contacts between individuals in the Susceptible compartment (S) with infectives per unit of time [23] . Then, (βI/N )S represents the number of new cases per unit time due to the S susceptibles which are removed from S and incorporated to compartment E. The individuals in E had contact with the disease but they are not yet infectious. After an average time of 1/λ days an individual in E is moved to the Infectious compartment. Finally, after an average number of 1/γ days it is moved to the Removed compartment where the case is no longer active (i.e. the individual is recovered or dead). It is assumed that an intervention policy can be implemented in a way that the contact rate between susceptible and infectious individuals can be diminished. Therefore, β can be replaced with (1 − u)β [16, 18] , with u ∈ [U min , U max ] and 0 ≤ U min < U max ≤ 1. This formulation leads to the following set of ordinary differential equations:If the number of infectious cases rises above certain critical level, the health care systems capacity may saturate. Then, as the number of available ICU is surpassed the quality of health provided to individuals deteriorates and consequently, the death counts may increase dramatically. In many countries, a variety of measures were taken with the aim of flattening the infection curve and 'to slowing down' the progression of the disease. Then, crucial time could be gained not only to incorporate new medical equipment but also to provide staff training. Based on this observation the following constraint can be formulatedwhere I max is a value provided by authorities such that it ensures the health care system response will be adequate. Then, the design of u(t) as an NPI policy is required. Recalling that u(t) ∈ [U min U max ], a time varying function could be applied according to the disease time evolution.3 Proposed control strategyThe proposed control scheme is based on the adjustment of the control input u according to the evolution of infectious individuals I. The idea is to fulfill constraint (2) and to reduce the risk of a collapse of the health care systems. To this end consider a continuous measurement of the infectious individuals. Then, the following auxiliary function is proposedwhere τ > 0 is a design parameter. The proposed control action is:As the constraint σ = 0 is enforced to the system, the dynamics of I results in:Thus, the parameter τ adjusts the approaching rate of I to I max and can be used to control the speed at which the rate of infectious cases tends to the limit. Fig. 2 .A presents an example of the time evolution of I for different values of I max . The corresponding phaseplane plot is shown in Fig. 2 .B, where the constraint σ = 0 corresponds to straight lines joining the points (0, I max /τ ) and (I max ,0). When the system trajectory reaches σ = 0, it slides on this constraint towards the point (I max ,0) fulfilling eq. (2).A SM regime can be established only if there is a unitary relative degree of σ(t) with respect to the manipulated variable (the transversality condition [24] ). By replacing dI/dt in eq. (3):The time derivative of σ results inAdditionally, the control action must be high enough to enforce a sign change on the time derivative dσ/dt at σ = 0. The so-called equivalent control (u eq ), a continuous equivalent signal that would lead to the same dynamics resulting from the SM (but without any of its robustness features), can be obtained by setting eq. (7) to zero:This expression must take values in the range [U min , U max ] for SM to exist on σ = 0. Along this surface the number of exposed individuals isBy replacing (9) in (8), it can be shown that the numerator of the second term isThis term is positive in the region of operation of the SMRC (I < I max ) and consequently u eq < 1. If U max < 1 is provided, eqs. (8)-(10) can be used to determine whether the SM regime exists. As I(t) −→ I max the required control action tends to 1 − 1/(βS/N/γ), a singular control action that maintains I(t) = I max [18] . It is worth noting that γ, λ and the contact rate β in (7) are co-linear with the control action. That is, these important model parameters fulfill the matching condition [24] . Thus, provided the equivalent control action in (8) remains within the range [U min , U max ] (i.e. the necessary and sufficient condition for SM holds), the scheme is insensitive with respect to variations on either β, γ or λ.First, and to show the proposal features, an ideal theoretical condition is assumed. Under this framework, the number of infectious is continuously reported and the ideal control law is applied, i.e., when σ = 0 is reached the control input can be switched according to eq. (4) at infinite frequency. Then, in Section 5 simulations for a more realistic scenario are compared with the ideal one to show the proposal applicability.where t f corresponds to the total time duration of the epidemic. A higher value of RLI implies a harder restriction. As can be seen from Table 1 , both closed-loop cases achieve a lower level of restriction and, as expected, the case with τ =150 increases this value over the τ =15 one. The solid gray lines in Fig. 3 show the system evolution for τ =150 days. This case would serve as a recommendation to be applied from the detection of the first confirmed case. As can be seen, the system behavior resembles the 50 % constant restriction case as far as disease duration is concerned. The use of a larger τ allows starting acting much earlier in the face of a rapid approach to the imposed limitation. As the figure depicts, the imposed limit is never reached obtaining a lower infectious peak than in the 50% constant restriction case, also with a shorter duration in restrictions.The control action based on a high-frequency switching is not applicable on the population (i.e. continuous opening and closing of economical and social activities is not realizable). The proposed implementation, which makes use of the available measurements (the daily reports of cases), is depicted in Fig. 6 . The procedure is summarized in the following steps:1. Initially, when I < I max the epidemic course is monitored using the available information (new infections, recoveries and deaths) and the function σ(t) is evaluated. When σ = 0 is reached, Step 2 is triggered.Remark :Step 1 acts only on the initial transient and implicitly assumes that the beginning of the intervention can occur in any day of the week. If this is not the case, it can be omitted starting in Step 2.The information utilized in 2) includes available measurements and it can be extended with updated parameters estimates (e.g. β, γ) provided by other algorithms [25] . Also, the value of I max can be adapted according to the current situation of the health care system. Since the state E is not accessible, the value given in eq. (9) can be taken as the initial condition for E. In Step 3 u can be replaced with a more conservative action (e.g. the maximum value of low-pass filtered version of u).Step 4 describes a basic implementation: once the NPI is issued to the community nothing is done until the period of T days has finished. The proposal can be extended in order to manage specific events such as a sudden soar in the number of infections. Additionally, Step 4 assumes that the control action is effective immediately. It can be adapted taking into account a few days for communicating the new decisions to the population before its effective implementation. Although some important measures (e.g. a lockdown, changes in public transportation rules) require a few days of publishing, there are other actions that can be readily implemented (e.g. number personal transit passes approved per day) [11] .To assess the potential application of the algorithm for the NPI policy design, another significant issue is the translation of u to real-world actions. Certainly any real value in the interval [U min , U max ] is not realizable. Then, a discretization in a set of finite values should be considered. The mapping between the required values and concrete actions is beyond the scope of this work. Studies in many countries have estimated the effect of different strategies and can serve as a guide for determining the potential effect of each order [2, 27] .A more realistic situation for the first scenario (β=0.22 day −1 ) is presented in Fig. 7 , where the issues discussed above are taken into account. Black lines correspond to τ =15 days and grays lines to τ =150 days. Dashed lines represent the theoretical case meanwhile the solid ones do it for the realistic case. Daily sampling of I was considered for calculating σ(t) during the initial transient. In this case a zero-crossing event is considered for triggering Step 2 and consequently a small delay is introduced. Additionally, in order to incorporate output discretization, only five equally-spaced values in the range [0,1] were allowed. These quantization levels ""resemble"" the five phases of restrictions adopted by the Argentinian government, phase 1 being the more restrictive one. Each phase contemplates the gradually incorporation of new kinds of activities which could be matched with different constant levels of restrictions. The transition from one phase to another depends on the evolution of the infectious.It is important to remark that while in the simulation a given control action is fixed for a period of 15 days, the system evolution can be continuously checked to act in consequence if an improper behaviour is perceived. Within the period of discretization, different types of events may occur in the society, such as protests, which can drastically modify the evolution that was being considered. Also, as a simulation allows one to see future scenarios, different hypothetical situations could be tested to decide which policy to apply at each pandemic stage.The proposed algorithm is tuned by three intuitive parameters (τ , I max , T ) that provide flexibility to adapt the system response based not only on the number of infectious cases but also on the political and sanitary situation. An improved performance, quantified as lower restriction measures without surpassing the health system capacity, is achievable with the SMRC approach by shaping the infectious time-distribution. The realistic piece-wise discretized control considering a short number of NPI levels performed very close to the theoretical case, showing the proposal applicability.This SMRC approach could be applied in different cities, where independent levels for I max can be considered according to the health system capacity and epidemiological situation. Further improvements include periodic update of parameters and coupling with estimators for allowing a time-varying I max . Also, the application to models that include compartments for quarantine, asymptomatic cases as well as exchange of individuals between regions can be explored.",Argentina,first author,2020-09-23,9
5a6407fba39b0b8ff8e47421b532737bb21f80c9,,"Like in most countries, the COVID-19 pandemic has deeply disrupted all aspects of daily life in Chile, starting from the way we approach our health care system, to job security, education, and even how we mobilize, among many others. Mitigating measures such as non-pharmaceutical interventions have become essential for preventing massive outbreaks and reducing systemic stress in hospitals and clinics. However, some of these interventions may have had differential effects depending on the population characteristics.In this paper, I provide evidence of heterogeneity in the effectiveness of quarantines or lockdowns at the municipality level in Chile's capital city during the first two months of the pandemic. I also shed light on some of the reasons that could explain these differential effects, such as the probability of compliance with lockdown measures by area, as well as differences in testing availability for different groups. The Chilean context provides a particularly rich setting to analyze the effectiveness of lockdown measures, as quarantines were implemented during the first two months of the pandemic at the municipality level, which are the smallest administrative divisions in the country. Municipalities are some of the smallest areas that have experienced quarantine in comparison to other countries and allow me to analyze differential effects within a major city. Leveraging administrative data at the municipality level and an Augmented Synthetic Control Method approach, I build a counterfactual for higher and lower-income municipalities that entered quarantine from a pool of untreated areas that resemble the evolution pattern of the treated units before the policy was implemented, finding substantial differences in the effectiveness of quarantine measures by income.Understanding the effectiveness of containment measures is of critical importance during a pandemic, but not only its average impact, but also the effect lockdowns had on specific populations of interest. In terms of policy evaluations, average treatment effects are often of limited value as they hide potential null or even opposite effects for specific groups of interest (Imai & Ratkovic, 2013) . In the case of quarantine policies, if certain populations are less likely to comply with lockdown measures due to differences in opportunity costs of staying at home, or asymmetry in information in terms of infections, then it is important to put in place complementary measures that will improve compliance.Evidence related to the effectiveness of lockdown or shelter-in-place measures shows positive effects on the containment and reduction of the COVID-19 spread (Bonaccorsi et al., 2020; Bonardi et al., 2020; Dave et al., 2020; Flaxman et al., 2020; Hsiang et al., 2020; Patel et al., 2020; Prem et al., 2020; Vinceti et al., 2020) . For example, Hsiang et al. (2020) conduct an analysis of 1,700 non-pharmaceutical measures in six different countries, finding that quarantines and lockdowns were associated with a substantial slow-down of the spread of COVID-19. Flaxman et al. (2020) echo the previous results by modeling the transmission of the disease using data from 11 European countries. The authors find that lockdown measures are positively correlated with the containment of In the context of the current literature, this paper presents two main contributions: (i) the estimation of causal effects of small-area lockdowns on the spread of COVID-19 by leveraging a natural experiment, and (ii) the identification of heterogeneous effects by socioeconomic characteristics.One of the main difficulties of identifying causal effects for quarantines is that their adoptions are associated with other confounding variables that make causal identification difficult or even unfeasible. However, the Chilean setting provides a solid natural experiment given the loose definition used to impose the first quarantines. Additionally, unlike in many other countries, lockdowns in Chile were applied at the smallest administrative level (municipalities). These small areas provide variation even within a city, allowing for the construction of better counterfactuals and estimation of differential effects according to municipality's characteristics. Given that measures that are effective for certain groups might not have the same effect on others, estimating the impact of lockdowns by income level can provide relevant feedback for policymakers to better understand how to target and complement current policies. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides context of the Chilean case and the measures implemented to fight the spread of COVID-19. Section 3 outlines the augmented synthetic control method used for estimating the effects of lockdown policies by income at the municipality level and its results. In section 4, I discuss potential mechanisms that could explain part of the differential effectiveness of quarantines. Finally, section 5 concludes with some final remarks and further discussion.The spread of COVID-19 in Chile started slowly, with its first confirmed COVID-19 case on March 3rd, 2020. During the first weeks of the pandemic, most of the spread of the virus was contained in the east side of Santiago, in the Metropolitan Region, which is the most affluent area of the city. However, by mid-April, the virus had already spread throughout the city, as it can be seen in Figure 1 .To try to mitigate the spread of the virus, the Chilean government declared the first lockdowns during the final week of March 1 in 7 municipalities of the Metropolitan Region, and a few other cities across the country. The second wave of quarantines was around mid-April, which included three municipalities. Finally, by the end of April, three additional municipalities in Santiago entered lockdown. Figure 2 shows the location of the different quarantines in the Metropolitan Region by timing, and Table 4 in the Appendix shows the exact dates municipalities went into and out of lockdown. To provide some context on the units of analysis, Chile has 346 municipalities in total, which drastically vary in size: from a couple of hundred residents to over 500,000 in 2017 (Biblioteca 1 Only two other municipalities had been in quarantine before March 25th: Caleta Tortel and Rapa Nui. Caleta Tortel is a remote and small southern municipality which declared an early quarantine due to a cruise ship arriving with a confirmed case. Rapa Nui, or Easter Island, is an island far from the coast of Chile and took early precautions after its firsts confirmed cases. municipality (or part of a municipality) was declared on quarantine, people that lived in that area could not leave their residence without legal authorization.Additionally, non-residents were not allowed to transit in quarantined areas either. Essential services were still open during this time.To assess the effect that quarantines had on the evolution of new cases at the municipality level, a natural approach would be to compare treated areas with those that are similar but were not affected by lockdowns, assuming that conditional on some observable features, the assignment of quarantines was random. In this context, Synthetic Control Method lends itself nicely to estimate a causal effect of these policies (Athey & Imbens, 2017) .Synthetic Control Method (SCM) is a popular approach in causal inference settings that, under certain assumptions, provides a valid counterfactual for a unit that was treated at a specific point in time (Abadie & Gardeazabal, 2003; Abadie et al., 2010 Abadie et al., , 2015 . SCM uses a weighted combination of untreated units from a donor pool to build a ""synthetic"" version of the treated one that resembles its behavior prior to the intervention. Some of the main advantages of the SCM are that it does not rely on extrapolation (weights are non-negative and sum to one), and that it is a transparent method in the sense that makes the differences between treatment and its counterfactual explicit, as well as the contribution of each of the control units (Abadie, 2019).Using the notation on Ben-Michael et al. (2020) , Equation 1 shows the typical setting for SCM where one unit i is treated (i = 1) in period T 0 < T . W i is a treatment indicator for unit i, and weights γ scm i ∈ [0, 1] are estimated to minimize the difference in pre-intervention trends between the treated unit and the synthetic control. These weights are then used to approximate the potential outcome under control of the treated unit in the post-intervention period T ,Following a similar setup, the Augmented Synthetic Control Method (ASCM)proposed by Ben-Michael et al. (2020) also builds a counterfactual for the treated observations based on a weighted combination of untreated units. However, the main advantage of ASCM over traditional synthetic control methods is that it provides ""bias correction"" when pre-treatment fit is imperfect. This bias correction means that even when the synthetic control does not closely follow the path of the treatment group in the pre-intervention period, ASCM provides a method to de-bias the original SCM estimate using, for example, a ridgeregularized linear regression as an outcome model. The trade-off, in this case, is that ASCM allows non-negative weights to improve pre-treatment fit, but the method focuses on minimizing extrapolation outside the convex hull.Using the same setup as the one described for 1, Equation 2 shows how ASCM would be applied in a setting were there is potentially a poor fit in a particular function of pre-intervention outcomes,m(·) (Ben-Michael et al., 2020) . In this case, the estimated counterfactual for SCM is ""corrected"" by the observed imbalance. This setup can be extended for more complex settings, such as multiple treated units, staggered designs, and different choices of estimators (Ben-Michael et al., 2019 .In SCM and ASCM settings, three assumptions need to hold to estimate a valid average treatment effect on the treated: i) assignment of the treatment is random conditional on the donor pool, observable covariates, and preintervention path of the outcome, ii) Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), and iii) the intervention had no effect prior to its start date.The first assumption relates to the idea that synthetic control methods use a weighted average of units from the donor pool to build an estimate of the missing potential outcome, and those units are chosen based on pre-intervention fit. Overall, the decision to declare quarantine in a municipality at the beginning of the pandemic depended on diverse factors, but the most important one was the progression of the spread: Areas with a higher number of total cases and an increasing number of new cases were likely candidates for this policy. However, decisions had a political component as well, which provides a level of exogeneity to the decision that makes the conditional ignorability assumption likely to hold in this setting. For example, when the first lockdowns were declared in March 25th, there were three other municipalities not affected that had the same or even a higher number of total cases than most of the areas that entered quarantine, and actually, the municipality of Independencia, which entered an early lockdown, was just top 30 in number of cumulative cases. The story is similar when we look at daily new cases: 3 out of the top 10 municipalities with the highest number of daily cases on March 25th did not experience quarantine.These three municipalities were also located high in the ranking of total cases, and are high-density population areas.The second assumption, SUTVA, implies that the intervention only affects the treated units and does not affect non-treated municipalities. The geographic nature of lockdowns, however, might make this assumption less likely to hold: If residents from a municipality on lockdown were more likely to leave and mobilize to nearby areas that were not subjected to quarantines, these spillovers would break SUTVA. To avoid potential effects on neighboring municipalities, I build a buffer zone around treated units using the areas that would be more likely to experience spillovers due to quarantines and exclude these zones from the donor pool. I also exclude two coastal municipalities (Vina del Mar and Concon), given that they are a common second-home destination for residents of Santiago.Regarding the final assumption, anticipation effects could potentially play a role in the estimation of the effect of lockdowns if there is an important lag between the announcement of the measure and the start of quarantines. Given that people usually need to prepare for quarantine, it is not uncommon to see surges in mobility in the period between the announcement and the beginning of lockdowns. In the case of Chile, the first and second waves of quarantines were announced one and two days before their implementation, respectively. 2 Even though the period between announcement and enforcement is short, I use the day of the announcement as the starting period of treatment, to avoid potential confounding.To estimate the effects of lockdowns on new cases over time, I use publicly available data from the Ministry of Health Epidemiological Reports (Departamento de Epidemiologia, 2020) on the number of new cases by municipality over time. Because these reports are only delivered every 2 to 3 days, I rely on interpolation to build daily data based on daily regional contagion rates, closely approximating the number of daily cases at the municipality level. 3For analyzing heterogeneous effects by income at the municipality level, I take three sets of municipalities for the period between March 15th and May 8th: 1) high-income areas that had quarantines before April 30th, 2020 in the capital city, 2) lower-income areas that had quarantines prior to the same date in the same region, and 3) other large municipalities that did not have lockdown measures before April 30th. 4 The latter group serves as the ""donor"" pool or counterfactual pool for the first two. are not considered in the previously described high-income group. Average characteristics for these different groups are shown in Table 1 . Using a Ridge ASCM approach (Ben-Michael et al., 2020) and following the previously described groups of analysis, I build counterfactuals for three groups of municipalities in Santiago that experienced quarantines: (i) highincome municipalities (H), (ii) lower-income municipalities (L), and (iii) the combination of the previous two groups (A), such that A = H ∪ L. Then, for each group g, I estimate the optimal weights for the municipalities in the donor pool that balance pre-intervention trends (e.g. daily number of cases in group g) and baseline covariates (i.e. income per capita, population density, total number of cases, and poverty rate), allowing for extrapolation but penalizing the departure from traditional SCM weights. Table 2 and Figure 3 show the overall effect of quarantines on the number of new cases over time for all municipalities that had quarantines in the Metropolitan Region. 5 I use a 12-day mark to assess the effectiveness of the quarantine because that is the number of days needed for most people to develop symptoms (Lauer et al., 2020) . Estimates for each period are obtained using the Ridge ASCM weights previously described, and standard errors are estimated using a jackknife method. 6 . Figure 3 shows that after the 12 days since the start of the lockdown period, treated municipalities experience a lower number of new cases over time, though the difference is not statistically significant at conventional levels and the magnitude of the effect is also modest.This seemingly positive result, however, hides an important degree of heterogeneity in terms of the effectiveness of quarantines. When I analyze higherincome municipalities in Santiago compared to other municipalities, we can see that the results differ by socioeconomic level (Figure 4 ). municipalities. By the end of the series, confidence intervals are too wide and I do not have enough statistical power to reject a null effect, but the pattern shows However, Figure 4b shows another side of the story. In this case, even though the effect is not statistically significant at 10% level, the estimate is opposite to what we would expect: there is an increase in the number of new cases over time even after the 12-day mark. In this case, given that some lower-income municipalities entered lockdown later in time, the post-quarantine period of analysis is shorter compared to higher-income municipalities. However, the same results stand when using only early-adopters of quarantines for the lowerincome group.One potential concern for the identification of causal effects, in this case, would be that people change their mobility patterns from one municipality in lockdown to a neighboring area which is not in quarantine, breaking SUTVA.To avoid confounding the effect with potential spillovers, I run a robustness check of the ASCM by including a buffer zone around treated municipalities, which are excluded from the control pool (see Appendix for a map of the buffer zones). Results are shown in Table 3 , and they are very similar to the original estimated average treatment effects on the treated for both groups.As it was previously mentioned, another concern in terms of comparison of the effects between high-and lower-income municipalities is the timing of the lockdowns. If lower-income areas were systematically treated later in the pandemic, it could be the case that the timing factor is confounding my results. To avoid this potential issue, I only compare high-and lower-income municipalities that were treated roughly at the same time, using the same set of high-income areas, but only Santiago and Independencia as lower-income municipalities. Conclusions remain unchanged, as overall effects of lockdown measures were not effective in Santiago or Independencia, lower-income areas that were subject to quarantine at the same time that high-income municipalities ( Figure   5 ).Finally, for each of the groups analyzed, I exclude the municipality with the highest weight to see whether is one unit from the donor pool that is driving the results. 7 The exclusion of these municipalities do not substantially affect the conclusions, and results remain mainly unchanged. 8 7 For high-income areas I exclude Concepcion, for lower-income areas I exclude Renca, and for all the municipalities that were in quarantine I exclude Maipu 8 Results available in the public replication code. In this section, I study two different, but potentially complementary, hypotheses that could explain the heterogeneity in the effect of lockdowns on the number of new infections. The first one relates to the differential ability of households to stay at home during a lockdown, and the second one to the availability and timing of testing in different municipalities.Mobility has been highly reduced during the pandemic, both because of individual changes in behavior, but most importantly due to government policies aimed at avoiding contagion. Figure 6 shows data from Google Mobility Reports for the Metropolitan Region, which compares the number of visitors to transit stations over time between mid-February and early May to a baseline before the pandemic. 9 I focus on transit data, as it is a measure that most likely approximates mobility to and from work during labor days. As Figure 6 shows, the biggest drop in mobility was given by the closure of schools, with a 56% decrease. After that, there are no clear changes in mobility rates considering the active quarantines in Santiago. Excluding the day right before and after quarantines, there is no distinctive change in mobility for labor days when only the first wave of lockdowns was in place (i.e. high-income municipalities plus Santiago and Independencia), and when the second one started during that same period (i.e. half of the municipality of Puente Alto).Given that quarantines were targeted to specific areas in the Metropolitan Region and were not widespread, the aggregated mobility map may be hiding movement reductions for those areas. To test potential differences, I use data from the Mobility Index Report created by the Data Science Institute from UDD and Telefonica (Universidad del Desarrollo, 2020) to analyze changes in mobility before and after quarantine, using the same Augmented Synthetic ControlMethod described in the previous section. The mobility index presented here 9 Baseline consists of the period between January 3rd, 2020 and February 6th, 2020. To further analyze these mobility patterns, I compare data on subway validations 11 provided by the Ministry of Transportation. Figure 8 shows year-over-year percentage changes in subway 12 validations during the morning for the same period between 2019 and 2020. Dates have been adjusted in 2019 to align with major events in 2020 (first Monday in March and Easter weekend).As it can be seen in Figure 8 , high-income municipalities in quarantine had a higher reduction of their subway mobility compared to both lower-income areas in quarantine and other municipalities that were not affected. On average, after the announcement of the first wave of lockdowns, the difference between high and lower-income areas in quarantine was 8 percentage points. High-income municipalities appear to be more sensitive to overall policy measures and reduced their overall mobility patterns even earlier than expected.Some of these differences could be due to a higher ability for smoothing con- sumption (e.g. savings) or work-from-home opportunities that lower-income households do not have available, but more data would be required to study these hypotheses.One important factor that highly influences the containment of COVID- Publicly available testing data supports these differences in testing availability. By analyzing the correlation between private center testing and estimated positivity rate using publicly available data (Ministerio de Salud de Chile, 2020), 14 I find a significant negative correlation of -0.61 for the month of April. 15 This means that when private centers increased their share of testing, the number of new cases over total testing dropped (Figure 9 ), while the opposite was true for public-center testing. These patterns provide additional evidence that testing was more extensive in the private sector, where patients got tested with a lower probability of actually being infected. The difference between private and public center availability becomes particularly relevant when we consider that in high-income municipalities that had lockdown policies only 32% of residents were subscribed to the public health care system in 2017, while 13 The need for a physicians' referral, as well as the cost of the test, are some of the barriers that differentially affected lower and higher-income populations. 14 Estimated positivity rate refers to the number of new daily cases over the number of informed tests for that day. 15 Testing data is available continuously for type of testing center since 3/31/2020, and I use this data until 04/28/2020, given that the testing strategy changed to broader testing after that date.that number was 78% for lower-income areas that had quarantines before May 5th (Observatorio Social, 2017). In addition to the availability of testing for different groups, proper timing plays a key factor in the spread of COVID-19. Even though there is no official data related to the timing from testing to diagnosis, some reports show that test results could take between two to five days to get a result confirmation, depending on the lab (La Tercera, 2020). If we add these differences to the time it takes for patients to get tested, the period between getting infected and having a confirmed diagnosis could likely be over a week.Delays between test and diagnosis present major pitfalls in containment COVID-19 test, and also some degree of non-compliance with self-quarantine measures for patients that are waiting for their results.Using publicly available data provided by the Ministry of Health (Departamento de Epidemiologia, 2020), I combine different reports that gather the week of first symptoms by municipality over time. With this data, I estimate the difference in new cases between reports and the difference in the number of patients that reported initial symptoms each week. Using the fact that reports are made available every two to four days, I estimate the maximum days between first symptoms and diagnosis for these new cases and calculate the estimated proportion for days between first symptoms and confirmation, shown in Figure 10 .As it can be seen in Figure 10 , for both high and lower-income municipalities,there is a lag of at least three days between showing first symptoms and getting a confirmed diagnosis. However, differences become significant after the 4-day mark: While nearly a quarter of new cases in high-income municipalities have a confirmed diagnosis by day 5, only 15% of newly infected cases in lower-income municipalities have a confirmed test by that date. These differences remain fairly stable 7 days since first symptoms and shed light on the fact that lower-income areas that experienced quarantine have almost consistently less timely diagnosis, which can result in a higher number of infections of close contacts during that time. One caveat of the data provided by the Ministry of Health is that is subject to changes between reports that could be due to reasons other than new cases (e.g. further investigation about initial symptoms); however, if we assume this measurement error is not systematically correlated with municipality's income, the difference between both curves is still informative. The effectiveness of mitigation measures plays a paramount role in contagion containment during a pandemic. For the same reason, understanding how interventions work for different populations is key for designing and implementing policies that will actually help reduce the spread of COVID-19. In this case, average treatment effects can hide potentially harmful evidence for populations that are more at risk.The differential risks of contagion between socioeconomic groups is particularly important when considering the health, economic, and general welfare ramifications of the pandemic. Lower-income groups are usually the ones that have fewer protection mechanisms to overcome a health crisis, so mitigation policies should be especially tailored to protect vulnerable populations.In this paper, I show evidence that small-area lockdown measures had a differential effect on high and lower-income populations. While quarantines proved effective in reducing new daily cases in more affluent areas, they did not have a significant effect on lower-income municipalities. Timely testing and difference in opportunity costs for staying at home might have played a role in explaining part of this difference. These results suggest that mobility-reduction measures are not equally effective, and current policies should potentially be accompanied by complementary measures that boost the effectiveness of lockdowns.The causal identification of these effects relies on the assumption that a valid counterfactual for municipalities in quarantine can be built from those areas that did not experience lockdowns. Even though the loose criteria used by the Chilean government lends itself nicely as a natural experiment in this setting, the method employed here does rely to a certain extent on extrapolation to build a valid comparison group. Even though the use of Ridge ASCM penalizes the departure from traditional SCM weights, it is important to consider the context of the problem and deem whether the trade-off between extrapolation and better fit is appropriate for the setting.Finally, given the speed with which governments need to act during a pandemic, more data, better data, and timely data are needed to assess some of these policies when they are implemented and provide swift feedback that could help improve or complement current interventions. Note: High-income municipalities in blue, and lower-income municipalities in green. Municipalities in white are excluded from the analysis because (i) their quarantine period is too short within the analysis window or (ii) they are not located in the capital region.

Older patients are at risk of hospitalisation and severe disease. [1] Globally, a high proportion of long term care facilities (LTCF) have reported COVID-19 outbreaks, with high rates of morbidity and mortality in residents. [2, 3] In the UK, according to the latest report from the Care Quality Commission, as of 5 th June 2020, 11,614 nursing home residents died of COVID-19, contributing to a quarter of all COVID-19 related deaths. [4] In some European countries, the proportion of COVID-19 cases in LTCFs who have died has exceeded 60% of all reported deaths, underlining the severe impact of COVID-19 on this frail population. [2, 5] The transmission dynamics of COVID-19, combined with low availability of testing in some countries have fuelled a rapid spread within and between facilities.. [3] Residents of LTCF who display symptoms of COVID-19 are commonly hospitalised. However, it is currently not clear when a patient with COVID-19, can be discharged after sufficient clinical improvement in hospital. Where they continue to be infectious following recovery, this may lead to increased transmission within LTCFs.On the other hand, a prolonged inpatient stay may put them at risk of nosocomial infections, and occupying a hospital bed unnecessarily, with potential downstream impacts on patient flow and hospital capacity.We therefore reviewed the discharge criteria for inpatients with COVID-19 in the 10 countries with the highest incidence of COVID-19, as of 26 th July 2020( Second, it appears that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appears to occur predominantly in the presymptomatic phase and less than five days after symptom onset. Cheng and colleagues show a detailed contact tracing response to cases in Taiwan. They found no secondary transmission from contact exposures after the fifth day of symptom onset, suggesting a relatively short infectious period. [9] He and colleagues reported temporal patterns of viral shedding in 94 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 and modelled COVID-19 infectivity profiles from a separate sample of 77 infector-infectee transmission pairs. They found that the highest viral load in throat swabs were at the time of symptom onset. [10] A recent study of COVID-19 in the quarantined Italian town of Vo found that 42% of COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic infections. The lack of effective guidelines on safe discharge of patients with nosocomial acquisition of COVID-19 who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic could potentially lead to outbreaks in LTCFs. [11] Third, no guideline has an approach tailored to discharge to LTCFs, where frail, vulnerable and ultimately the highest risk residents require daily assistance with all activities of daily living.Potentially related to this are some findings of live SARS-CoV-2 in the faeces of some patients from China [12, 13] , earlier on in the pandemic (Feb 2020). However, five months on from these reports, there have not been any reports of major COVID-19 outbreaks related to this route of transmission.Therefore, the use of PCR-based discharge criteria alone may be unhelpfulin determining infectivity and the timing of patient discharge. Although SARS-CoV-2 viral culture offers an indication of virus infectivity, it may take 3-6 days to observe a cytopathic effect, is labour-intensive and requires high level laboratory (Category 3/Biosafety Level 3) facilities. Furthermore, most diagnostic laboratories in the UK have stopped offering viral culture as a service and the skill sets/infrastructure needed to deliver it no longer exist.Whilst PCR-based testing on inactivated viral extracts is safer and quicker, and can be semi-or fully automated, PCR results do not necessarily give a reliable indication of infectivity. Although Bullard We believe this approach to be simple, the most evidence based, and applicable to all countriesfor the moment.

Therefore, the results of such a study in Brazil can guide further healthrelated policy decision making in similar tropical countries.To the best of our knowledge, so far, no empirical study has comprehensively explored the role of these different relevant weather factors in COVID-19 deaths covering 27 different administrative regions in Brazil, controlling for various other time-varying factors well as region-specific time-constant factors. In this observational study, we empirically describe the role of these weather factors in COVID-19 deaths in Brazil. We observe a significant negative association of daily growth rate of cumulative COVID-19 deaths (COVID-19 daily deaths growth rate) in Brazil with weather factors -UVI, temperature, ozone and cloud cover, indicting their respective protective roles. Surprisingly, contrary to other studies, we do not find any association between COVID-19 daily deaths growth rate and humidity, visibility and precipitation. We find our results to be consistent even when we use the case-fatality-rate (CFR) as the dependent variable.Moisture-based weather factors like precipitation may play a role in converting dry environment into moist and cold conditions, making it more conducive for the survival and transmission of viruses 15 . However, precipitation and cloud cover also influence the behaviour of people, limiting their likelihood of outdoor activities and thereby potentially impacting the transmission of COVID-19.Further, air pollution 16 may be a significant risk factor for respiratory infection as it affects the immune system 17 , as well as denser particulate matter, could carry coronavirus for more extended periods as well as across larger distances 17 . Studies also indicate a significant association of air pollution and COVID-19 death rate 17 . Furthermore, studies show that the presence of air pollutants like ozone is also associated with an increased risk of ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) 18 , which is a significant risk factor in COVID-19. On the contrary, some studies also indicate a protective role of ozone as it reduces the transmission of viral diseases like influenza 19 and plausibly COVID-19 20 , plausibly due to anti-viral effects 20 .UV Radiation, another weather factor, plays a protective role in two ways. UV Radiation inactivates viruses in fomite transmission, thereby mitigating the viral spread and deaths 21 .Therefore, based on the prior studies, we consider temperature, humidity, UV Index, precipitation, ozone, visibility and cloud cover to be the relevant factors to consider for exploring the role of weather in COVID-19.We anticipate that studies exploring the role of weather in COVID-19 need to consider all the above relevant weather factors, as considering only a subset of these factors may confound and limit the reliability of results 45 . Early studies also indicate that a tropical country like Brazil shows some substantial variation from higher latitude countries with low temperature and low UV Index or those with periods under winter 4 . We argue that conclusions of studies with over-representation of locations with a lower temperature or lower UV 45 either due to the study period or due to specific regions may have limited applicability in a tropical country like Brazil. Furthermore, prior studies indicate that an extended study period helps in strengthening the evidence for the association between these factors and COVID-19 4 . Therefore, it is vital to consider relevant weather parameters as well as the regional characteristics and the duration of the study.We provide an overview of the evaluation of various studies focusing on the role of the above relevant weather parameters in COVID-19, as shown in Table 1 Further, studies exploring the impact of these weather factors on a tropical country like Brazil are limited. A few studies focused on Brazil find a negative association with temperature 2,47 ; whereas others show a positive association with temperature 4 and humidity 4, 56 or no association with temperature 56 . Further, as shown in Table 1 , the majority of the Brazilian studies used data for a shorter period covering only the time until the start of Brazilian winter. Furthermore, no studies in Brazil has so far considered weather factors such as UV Index, ozone, visibility and cloud cover.Extending the study by Moozhipurath, Kraft, and Skiera (2020) 32 i.e., the protective role of UVB radiation in COVID-19 is valid for a tropical country like Brazil, with higher UVI and limited variation in UVI and temperature. Contrary to the above studies, we also use a more comprehensive weather dataset focusing on Brazil, a tropical country in Southern Hemisphere with additional weather factors such as wind speed, dew point, pressure and wind gust. We also use a more extended period of data.We perpetuity.We summarize our main results in Table 4 . After controlling for all time-constant and various time-varying confounding factors, we note a substantial and significant negative association of daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths (COVID-19 daily deaths growth rate) with UVI, cloud cover, maximum temperature and ozone, with a moving average window of 42 days (Model 1 in Table 4 ). Specifically, a permanent unit increase of of daily growth rates of COVID-19 deaths as compared to the average daily growth rates over two weeks (14 days). As these results indicate, the above associations are substantial in relative terms, over a period of two weeks. Model 2 of Table 4 outlines that the results are consistent, even when we use CFR as the dependent variable. The estimated associations in Model 2 are weaker than those of Model 1 as the weather factors not only affect the COVID-19 deaths but also the infections, as outlined in section 2 of this manuscript.We observe a significant negative association of COVID-19 daily growth rate in Brazil with weather factors -UVI, temperature, ozone and cloud cover.

However, it is surprising that even in a tropical country like Brazil with high average UV Index and most of the geographic area below 33°S, UVB radiation plays a crucial mitigating role in COVID-19. These results are consistent with the emerging observational and clinical findings related to the protective role of UVB radiation due to its role in the inactivation of viruses as well as vitamin D synthesis 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 . This finding can guide the policy decisions, for examplesensible sunlight exposure and vitamin D supplementationeven in tropical countries.outdoors. In contrast to many other studies 45,10,15,50,51,46,52 , we do not find any association between COVID-19 daily deaths growth rate and other weather factors such as humidity, visibility and precipitation in Brazil. We observe our results to be consistent across various model specifications, especially for UVI and cloud cover, even after incorporating additional time-varying weather parameters such as dewpoint, pressure, wind speed and wind gust.We control for all time-constant and region-specific factors and different time-varying confounding factors 32,33 . Nevertheless, we admit that we may not be able to exclude other time-varying confounding factors, which might affect our results 32,33 . Our study uses the latest COVID-19 data with one of the comprehensive datasets available on weather in Brazil at an administrative region level.In general, tropical countries do not undergo substantial variation in temperature and UVB radiation across seasons. However, our results indicate that even in such tropical countries, a consistent drop in UVI or temperature due to change of seasons (e.g., monsoon, rainy season, winter) may be associated with a substantial increase in the daily death growth rate of COVID-19. These results also serve as an early warning for tropical regions in the Northern Hemisphere which is transitioning to autumn/winter. Furthermore, our study indicates that with the arrival of summer (higher temperature and higher UVI), tropical countries in the southern hemisphere like Brazil may face a decline in COVID-19 deaths.

6b0bbd2e3847e36f1c0287e8686ce6246bb01d79,"INFERRED RESOLUTION THROUGH HERD IMMMUNITY OF FIRST COVID-19 WAVE IN MANAUS, BRAZILIAN AMAZON","Comparison of population attack rates to inform this question is made challenging by 29 imperfect case ascertainment, compounded by limited diagnostics and overwhelmed health 30 systems, particularly in high incidence settings. Assessment of epidemic activity therefore 31 requires the use of less biased metrics than confirmed case reports. Excess mortality is an 32 objective measure which, with cause-of-death certification, can be used as an indicator of 33 direct and indirect COVID-19 associated mortality 7 . With hospitalisations data, it can inform 34 retrospective estimation of cumulative cases and deaths 8 . 35Brazil experienced a severe first wave of COVID-19 disease, with mass mortality reported in 36 many states, mainly in the north where seasonality of respiratory infections contributed to 37 higher vulnerability. A socialized health system provided free and global access to tertiary care 38 hospitals, but inequalities might explain different mortality rates in the population 9 . In Manaus, 39 the highly urbanised capital of Amazonas state, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on 13 40March 2020 10 . By 11 August 2020, 37,597 cases and 2,051 deaths were reported 11 . 41However, burial and death records indicate far higher mortality than official reports, suggesting 42 late recognition of importation and underreporting. Previous studies have assumed that the first 43 wave in Manaus was significantly mitigated by non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) 12 . 44While these restrictions may have partly constrained early transmission, local reports indicate 45 that implementation was highly variable 13 . Moreover, a possible role for immunity is suggested 46 by the observation of declining cases and deaths over a period in which restrictions were 47 officially eased. 48We use death certificate and hospitalisation records to parameterise an epidemiological model 49 of the COVID-19 epidemic in Manaus. The model allows inference of age-and gender-50 stratified infection-fatality ratios to explore evidence for development of herd immunity as a 51 driver of local epidemic resolution, with implications for the ongoing risk posed by SARS-52CoV-2 to this population. 53Stochastic transmission models captured the observed peak in excess deaths in late April, 65 including age and gender variation (Figure 3, Supplementary Figures S1, S3 ). The models also 66 captured synchronous peaks in hospitalisations (Figure 3, Supplementary Figures S2, S4 ), 67 although model fit to these data was poorer, potentially reflecting delayed recognition of 68 COVID-19 cases and/or capacity exceedance during the epidemic peak. 69Early time-series modelling of the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazilian states up to 6 May 2020 86 used an unstructured model informed by state-level mobility indicators and reported deaths 12 . 87The model inferred population attack rates ranging from 0.13% to 10.6%, for Minas Gerais 88 and Amazonas, respectively, and predicted ongoing epidemic growth throughout May. Other 89 modelled R0 estimates based on reported COVID-19 cases from Amazonas state have similarly 90 anticipated continued growth in cases through the month of June 13 . These models could neither 91 explain nor accurately forecast observations of epidemic decline in Manaus. 92Our analysis of excess deaths and hospitalisations in Manaus identifies rapid epidemic growth 93 from late March, peaking in late April, with a return to baseline mortality in early June. These 94 age-and gender-stratified models inferred heterogeneous transmission consistent with previous 95 studies of SARS-CoV-1 15 and SARS-CoV-2 16 , and a herd-immunity threshold of around 30%. 96However, we estimated that this threshold was substantially overshot in Manaus, with resulting 97 attack rates inferred to be 86% and 65% for models that assumed the risk of infection applied 98 to 100% or c. 75% of the population, respectively. 99Although both models estimated declining SARS-CoV-2 transmission over time due to herd 100 immunity, their implications for the possibility of subsequent waves are qualitatively different. 101Although there are currently no data to support the assertion that some fraction of the Manaus 102 population self-isolated, we consider the second model is likely more realistic because: (1) the 103 estimated infection-fatality ratios are higher than reported from high-income countries 17 which 104 we anticipate to be plausible; and (2) a population attack rate of 65% is more consistent with 105 recent estimates based on a Manaus blood bank serosurvey 18 which reported the largest 106 increase in seropositivity over the month of April. 107Death certificate data from January 2015 to June 2020 were sourced from the Brazilian 148Ministry of Health Mortality Information System (SIM). Information on age, gender, and 149 cause and date-of-death was recorded. Cause of death was reported using the World Health The ICD-10 codes assigned to each death certificate were aggregated into 7 categories: diseases 167 of the respiratory system (J00-J99), circulatory system (I00-I99), endocrine system (E00-E99), 168 unattended (R98) and unknown cause of death (R99), coronavirus infection (B34.2) and all 169 remaining codes were categorised as 'other'.

25b95bab785d3e7ce32623729bfe8e14a8bf8351,Modelling the epidemic growth of preprints on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2,"The COVID-19 pandemic is undoubtedly the most serious public health crisis in over a century. It has claimed the lives of nearly 900,000 people worldwide, as of this writing, and it has seemingly touched, in one way or another, every aspect of our daily lives. Not surprisingly, given the health risks represented by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the many scientific challenges involved, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on the scientific community. On the downside, social isolation and lockdown measures, for example, have caused disruption (if only temporary) of research projects that were being undertaken before and made it difficult for researchers to collaborate and discuss their work in person during the pandemic. But on the up side, the scientific community responded quickly to the challenges posed by the unprecedented crisis by producing an unprecedented number of scholarly works in a short period of time.A considerable proportion of this scientific output has been disseminated in the form of preprints posted before peer review on open and publicly available online platforms. Despite some concerns regarding the quality of preprints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] , in comparison to peer-reviewed articles, there seems to be a growing consensus that the benefits of the rapid sharing of information allowed by preprints ""far outweigh the disadvantages"" [2] . For example, a recent bibliometric analysis [5] of COVID-19 related preprints concluded that the faster rate with which they are posted on preprint repositories have only ""limited impact on the quality of preprints that are subsequently published."" Many other studies of both peer-reviewed papers and unrefereed preprints related to COVID-19 research have recently been conducted, but mostly with emphasis on the bibliometric aspects of the topic; see, e.g., Refs. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] and references therein.In the present paper we take a different approach from these previous studies. Here we seek to understand the growth dynamics underlying the rapid surge of preprints related to COVID-19 research. To this end, we employ a generalized logistic growth model to describe the time evolution of the cumulative number of preprints deposited on preprint repositories. Since the pioneering work by Verhulst on the standard logistic model [13] , phenomenological growth models have been successfully applied to many growth processes, ranging from human [13] and animal [14] population dynamics to epidemics [15] , including the COVID-19 epidemic itself [16, 17] . It is thus natural to expect that growth models should also be applicable to this ""epidemic in an epidemic,"" as the rapid surge of preprints on COVID-19 has been called [10] . More specifically, here we shall apply the generalized Richards model (GRM) to describe the cumulative curve of COVID-19 preprints. We show that the GRM does give a very good fit to the empirical curve. Furthermore, the model allows us to extract relevant information about the social dynamics driving this quick growth of preprints. We show, for instance, that the early growth in the number of COVID-19 preprints follows a subexponential regime-rather than an exponential behavior, as was initially thought [6, 12, 18] . The model also predicts that the growth profile is currently in a phase of decreasing deceleration.We also analyze the distribution of the COVID-19 preprints among the many available servers. Here we find that the corresponding rank-frequency distribution follows a power law, similar to the Zipf law found in many preferential attachment processes, such as the frequency of words in a text [19] , the size distribution of cities [20] , the wealth distribution of individuals [20] , and the distribution of nodes in social networks [21] , among others. We thus argue that the distribution of manuscripts among repositories also seems to follow a similar preferential attachment dynamics, whereby servers that already have more preprints tend to get more submissions.The data used in this study were obtained from the GitHub site maintained by Fraser and Kramer [22] . As explained in their site, preprints are considered to be related to COVID-19 on the basis of keywords matches in their titles or abstracts, according to the following search string: coronavirus OR covid-19 OR sars-cov OR ncov-2019 OR 2019-ncov OR hcov-19 OR sars-2. It is also explained there [22] that ""only the earliest posted version"" of a preprint is included in the dataset and that, in cases where a preprint is deposited to multiple repositories, ""all preprint records are included."" The first preprint included in their collection was posted on bioRxiv on January 15, 2020 [23] . The dataset used in the present study was updated up until August 30, 2020, and contains a total number of 24,644 preprints, distributed among 35 preprint servers, with 15 of them hosting more than 100 preprints. For the list of the fifteenth largest servers (as per the number of COVID-19 preprints), see Sec. 3. A complete list of the preprints servers in the dataset can be found in [5] .We model the growth dynamics by means of the generalized Richards growth model (GRM), which is defined by the following ordinary differential equation:where N (t) is the growing quantity at time t, r is the growth rate at the early growth stage, q controls the initial growth regime and allows to interpolate from linear growth (q = 0) to sub-exponential growth (q < 1) to purely exponential growth (q = 1), α is the asymmetry parameter that controls the asymmetry of the growth profile with respect to the symmetric S-shaped curve of the logistic model, which is recovered for q = α = 1, and K represents the total quantity at the end of the growth process (i.e., for t → ∞). Equation (1) must be supplemented with the initial condition N (0) = N 0 , for some given value of N 0 .Here we shall apply the GRM to the growing number of COVID-19 related preprints, so that N (t) will represent the cumulative number of preprints in our dataset up to the time t, where t is measured in days since the first preprint (hence N 0 = 1). In adjusting the GRM to the empirical data we need to determine four free parameters, namely (r, q, α, K); the numerical fit is made quite easy by the existence of an analytical solution for the GRM, as discussed next.Equation (1) admits an exact solution in implicit form given by [17] where f (N ; r, q, α, N 0 ) =with 2 F 1 (a, b; c; x) denoting the Gauss hypergeometric function [24] andThe fact that the solution of the GRM is given implicitly as t(N ), rather than as an explicit function N (t), does not represent any hurdle to its practical use. Indeed, the above solution can be directly applied for curve-fitting purposes by viewing the empirical data in the same 'implicit' form, namely t k as a function of N k , where N k are the data points at times t k . The availability of an exact solution also has the advantage that it allows us to compute explicitly the location of certain key characteristic points of the growth profile, as indicated below.For example, the inflection point t c of the curve N (t), whereN (t c ) = 0, is given by [17] Knowledge of the inflection point t c is important because it divides the growth process into two main phases according to its acceleration, as follows: i) an accelerating phase, for t < t c , whenN (t) > 0; and ii) a decelerating phase, for t > t c , during whichN (t) < 0. Each of these two main phases can be further divided into two subphases, according to whether the corresponding acceleration/deceleration is increasing 3 All rights reserved.

More specifically, we can define four growth stages, as follows:Having such a finer 'diagnosis' of the growth process is useful not only because it provides valuable information about the current stage of the underlying dynamics, but also because it allows us to make predictions about its likely evolution within the near future. For instance, depending on how close the current time t f is in comparison to the nearest phase-separation point, we may have an idea of how recently the growth curve has entered its current stage or how soon it may transition to the next one (if it is not yet in the last stage).In particular, we note that in the first subphase, i.e., for t < t − j , the GRM predicts a polynomial growth of the form [17] where A = [r(1 − q)] 1/(1−q) and µ = 1/(1 − q), for q < 1. In contradistinction, early exponential growth is obtained only for q = 1, in which case one has N (t) ≈ N 0 exp(rt). Similarly, in the late-time dynamics, i.e., for t > t + j , the GRM predicts an exponential rise to the plateau of the form [17] :A reasonable strategy decision in such situation is of course to favor those repositories that already have a substantial number of preprints. In the context of the COVID-19 emergency, this strategy makes particular sense for authors whose principal areas of expertise are not directly related to, say, epidemiology, infectious diseases, virology, etc. This selection dynamics naturally leads to the so-called cumulative advantage [25] or preferential attachment effect [21] , so that repositories that already have more preprints receive more submissions. Preferential attachment processes usually lead to rank-frequency distributions, P (n), that exhibit power-law decay or the so-called Zipf law [19, 26, 20, 25] :for n ≥ 1 and ρ > 0. In the next section we shall investigate the evidence of power-law behavior in the frequency distribution of COVID-19 preprints by repositories.To perform the statistical fit for the GRM, we employed the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to solve the non-linear least square optimization problem, as implemented in the lmfit package for Python [27] , which provides the parameter estimates and their respective errors. Here we have set N (0) = N 0 = 1, so that according to (2) we are left with four parameters, namely (r, q, α, K), to determine numerically. In the case of the rank-frequency distribution, we fitted the selected data with a simple power-law function, P (n) = Bn −ρ , and also applied lmfit to determine the parameters B and ρ. The computer codes for the statistical fits were written in the Python language, and the plots were produced with the data visualisation library Matplotlib.In Fig. 1 we show the cumulative number (red circles) of preprints on Covid-19 in our dataset, which we recall covers from January 15, 2020, to August 30, 2020, together with the GRM best fit (black solid curve). One sees from this figure that the theoretical curve describes very well the empirical data. Also shown in Fig. 1 are the point of maximum acceleration (orange vertical line), the inflection point (yellow vertical line), and the point of maximum deceleration (green vertical line), as obtained from the theoretical fit. The legend box in the figure shows the parameter estimates from the best fit.We have seen above that the time evolution of the number of COVID-19 related preprints is well described by the generalized Richards growth model. The application of such growth model allows us to infer several interesting aspects of the dynamics underlying the epidemic-like growth of COVID-19 preprints. First, we saw that that early in the epidemic the number of preprints increased in a subexponential manner, as indicated by the value q = 0.71 obtained from the GRM fit; see Fig. 1 . This means, more concretely, that initially the number of preprints grows polynomially in time according to (6) , with an exponent µ = 3.4, rather than exponentially fast as was claimed in some early bibliometric studies on the subject [6, 12, 18] . (We recall that pure exponential growth occurs only for q = 1.) This subexponential spreading is also found in many real epidemics [28] , including COVID-19 itself [29] . Polynomial epidemic growth is usually attributed to heterogeneous mixing [28, 30] , where clustering effects in the underlying propagation network can lead to polynomial spreading [31, 32] . So it is quite likely that such complex dynamics also takes place in the early rapid growth of COVID-19 publications, leading to a subexponential regime. (Developing a 'microscopic' epidemic model for the growth of COVID-19 preprints, where such effects could be studied in more detail, is an interesting problem but one that is beyond the scope of the present article.)We have found that the point of maximum deceleration (and hence zero jerk) of the theoretical growth curve happened on July 23, 2020, as indicated by the green vertical line in Fig. 1 . From the GRM fit, we have also computed the point of maximum jerk (not shown in Fig. 1 ) and obtained that it is predicted for September 11, 2020 . This implies that the growth curve is currently in a regime of decreasing deceleration and increasing jerk. One important effect of this increasing jerk is that it contributes to ""bend the curve"" away from the near-linear growth that is typical of intermediate region around the inflection point t c ; see Fig. 1 . The model thus predicts that the growth curve should from now on develop a more curved profile and that in the near future it will likely enter a saturation phase, where one should see a rather slower growth towards a plateau. It is not yet clear, however, how this approach to the plateau will take place: if exponentially fast as predicted by the GRM or in a subexponential fashion, in which case one would have to consider more general growth models [17] . The dynamical nature of this 'mature phase' will depend, of course, on the intensity level of the continuing research on themes related to COVID-19. As more data is accumulated over the next months, it will be possible to investigate in more detail this late-time regime.In conclusion, it is fair to say that, alongside the public health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic also triggered a scientific emergency. The scientific community has met this challenge by producing an unprecedented number of scholarly works in a very short period of time, so much so that the phenomenon has been dubbed ""an epidemic in an epidemic"" [10] . To better understand this ""scidemic,"" we have applied a generalized logistic growth model to describe the time evolution of the cumulative number of unrefereed preprints on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV2. Our analysis shows that the quick surge in COVID-19 related preprints can be seen as a sort of contagion process, where existing preprints tend to spur more preprints, and so on, in a cascade-like effect. Eventually this rapid growth is tamed by the system's own dynamics, as it takes more time and effort for researchers to obtain new results, leading to a deceleration in the growth of the preprint 'epidemic curve.' (Other factors, such as closer screening of preprints by the repositories and the return of researchers to pre-epidemic projects, may also contribute to the slowing down in the rate of publication of COVID-19 preprints.) This initial deceleration regime is expected to be followed by a saturation phase of slow growth, as both the COVID-19 and the publication epidemics subside. It is possible, however, that in view of the huge amount of data that has been, and continues to be, generated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that there are still many unanswered scientific questions, a somewhat steady level of COVID-19 publications may continue for a longer period, thus delaying the late-time saturation regime. the first draft.

6c932431adc4a67860e570955c7b6324329c7178,Dynamics of the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein drives dsRNA melting in a counterintuitive tweezer-like mechanism,"The recent pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , has become a global health emergency (1, 2) . SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus containing a large nonsegmented positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome, belonging to the Coronaviridae family (3, 4) . The 5' two-thirds of the coronaviruses' genome, corresponding to ORF1a/b, is translated into two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) that are proteolytically processed into sixteen nonstructural proteins (NSPs) (5) . These NSPs assemble in the viral replicasetranscriptase complex (RTC) at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, being responsible for genome replication and transcription (6) . Conversely, the 3' one-third of the genome is translated into accessory proteins as well as the four structural proteins, spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N), through a unique process of subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) transcription (7, 8) .N is one of the most abundant viral proteins in the infected cell. It is a 46-kDa multifunctional RNA-binding protein that drives the viral RNA packaging into a helical nucleocapsid (9) . In addition, N localizes at the RTC at early stages of infection and plays a central role in the regulation of RNA synthesis (10) (11) (12) . It is composed of two functionally distinct folded domains, which are interspersed by an intrinsically disordered linker region enriched in arginine and serine residues. Both the two domains and the linker region contribute individually to RNA binding (13) . The N-terminal domain (NTD) has been shown to interact with regulatory RNA sequences during subgenome transcription, whereas the C-terminal domain (CTD) is responsible for N protein dimerization, which is crucial for nucleocapsid assembly (14, 15) . The recently reported solution structure of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD reveals a right hand-like fold, composed of a five-stranded central β-sheet flanked 5 by two short α-helices, arranged in a β4-β2-β3-β1-β5 topology (16) . The β-sheet core is referred to as the hand's palm, while the long β2-β3 hairpin, mostly composed of basic amino acid residues, corresponds to the basic finger. The positively-charged cleft between the basic finger and the palm has been suggested as a putative RNA binding site (16) .Genome replication is a continuous process in coronaviruses. In contrast, transcription is discontinuous and involves the production of sgmRNAs (17) . Regulation of sgmRNA synthesis is dependent on transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRSs) located either at the 5' end of the positive-strand RNA genome, known as the leader TRS (TRS-L), or at the 5' end of each viral gene coding for structural and accessory proteins, called the body TRS (TRS-B). TRS-L and TRS-B share an identical core sequence, which allows for a template switch during sgmRNA synthesis. Once the TRS-B has been copied, the nascent negative-strand RNA is transferred to TRS-L and transcription is terminated (17, 18) .Multiple well-orchestrated factors, including TRS secondary structure, RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions, influence sgmRNA transcription (17) . Coronaviruses' N-NTD specifically interacts with the TRS and efficiently melts a TRS-cTRS RNA duplex, facilitating template switch and playing a pivotal role in the regulation of discontinuous transcription (10, 16, 17, 19) . Despite its relevance for the viral replication cycle, the molecular basis underlying the specificity of interaction of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with the TRS sequence remains elusive. Thus, understanding the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD specifically recognizes TRS RNA at atomic detail is paramount for the rational development of new antiviral strategies.Here, we present a hypothesis for the molecular mechanism of dsRNA melting activity of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD. We showed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (25 replicas of 100 ns) that N-NTD destabilizes dsRNA's Watson and Crick base-pairing 6 by dropping down intramolecular hydrogen bonds and perturbing the local rigid-body geometric parameters of dsRNA. The destabilization is more significant for TRS than for a non-specific (NS) dsRNA sequence. Moreover, a tweezer-like motion between β2-β3 and 2-β5 loops of N-NTD seems to be a key dynamic feature for selectivity and, consequently, dsRNA melting activity. We also constructed kinetic models for characterizing the melting activity of the dimeric N protein assuming 1:1 and 2:1 (N-NTD:dsRNA) stoichiometries, revealing that only one N-NTD is enough for dsRNA melting.We calculated the structural model of the N-NTD:dsTRS complex based on the experimental data for the N-NTD interaction with a non-specific dsRNA (5'-CACUGAC-3') (dsNS) (16) using the HADDOCK 2.2 server (20) . The structural restraints of the N-NTD:dsNS complex were defined from CSPs titration performed by Dinesh et al. (2020) (16) . The lowest-energy structure of the N-NTD:dsNS complex from the cluster with the lowest HADDOCK score (fraction common contacts = 0.8 ± 0.1 Å, interface-RMSD = 1.0 ± 0.6 Å, and ligand-RMSD = 2.2 ± 1.2 Å) was used to mutate the dsNS molecule to obtain the TRS sequence (5'-UCUAAAC-3') and, therefore, to generate the N-NTD:dsTRS complex structure. Figure 1A shows the structural model of the N-NTD:dsTRS complex, in which the TRS RNA is inserted in a cleft located between the large protruding β2-β3 loop, named finger, and the central -sheet of N-NTD, referred to as the palm. Analysis of the electrostatic surface potential of N-NTD revealed that the dsRNA-binding pocket is positively charged, with the finger being the highest charged region ( Figure S1 ). This result is consistent with the charge complementarity of the nucleic acid phosphate groups that exhibit negative charge. It is worth mentioning that the orientation of the TRS sense strand in the complex model is in agreement with experimental results described by Keane et al. (2012) for the Murine Hepatitis Virus structural homolog of N-NTD (21) , in which the 5'end of the sense strand binds close to β4-β2-β3 and the 3'-end binds next to β1-β5 ( Figure   1A ).We performed 25 calculations of 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the stability of the structural models of N-NTD in complex with either dsNS or dsTRS, as well as each of the biomolecules separately (dsNS, dsTRS, and N-NTD). Figure   1B To estimate the stability of the Watson-Crick (WC) base-pairing of dsNS and dsTRS complexed with N-NTD, we evaluated the intramolecular hydrogen bonds formed between sense and anti-sense strands of the dsRNA bound to N-NTD. In addition, the hydrogen bonds of the free RNA molecules were investigated as a control parameter. This confirms the consistency of the force field used to describe the studied molecular system. For the N-NTD-bound dsRNAs, we observed a decrease in the overall average number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds for both RNA ligands, accompanied by an 9 increase in respective standard deviations. This increase in standard deviation is due to a significant reduction in the average number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds of particular replicas, specifically 4 for dsTRS (runs 5, 8, 17, and 25) and 2 for dsNS (runs 15 and 23) ( Figure 3A ). The N-NTD-induced reduction in the number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the sense and anti-sense strands of dsRNAs was more pronounced for dsTRS than dsNS, as shown by the analysis of score profile in Figure 2 .In contrast to the decrease in the number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the sense and anti-sense strands of dsRNAs (WC base-pairing) due to N-NTD binding, we observed an increase in the average number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed between the nitrogenous bases of dsTRS and N-NTD (protein-RNA interaction) along the 100 ns MD simulation, whereas for dsNS, this average value was constant ( Figure 3B top). It is noteworthy that dsNS has more hydrogen bond-forming sites (acceptor and donor) than dsTRS and, in spite of that, the average number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds for the N-NTD:dsTRS complex is higher after 50 ns simulation. Figure 3B Figure S12 ). The structural model of the N-NTD:dsTRS complex presented in Figure 3C suggests a hypothesis for the mechanism 10 of action of N-NTD in which only one domain is capable of destabilizing the RNA duplex, possibly leading to its dissociation and ultimately release of the RNA single strands. Figure 4 ).Investigation of the stretch, stagger, and shear distances for dsNS and dsTRS showed that the equilibrium population at ~0 Å decreased for both dsRNAs as a result of N-NTD binding. However, this reduction is more drastic for dsTRS than dsNS, as can be seen in the inset for the respective plots in Figure 4 . In addition to this reduction effect, we also verified that N-NTD-bound dsTRS exhibited clear subpopulations at ~1, ~±1.5, and ~3 Å for the stretch, stagger, and shear distances, respectively. However, this destabilization effect is more evident for the N-NTD:dsTRS complex, since the above analysis of angle and distance parameters suggests an impairment of base-pairing planarity accompanied by an increase in the separation between the nitrogenous bases of the complementary dsRNA strands upon N-NTD binding. This result agrees well with the analysis of the intramolecular hydrogen bonds formed between the sense and anti-sense dsRNA strands (see Figure 3A ). It is worth mentioning that, even though base-pairing destabilization was more pronounced for dsTRS than dsNS, dsNS suffered a greater reduction in the RNA duplex twist, as suggested by the N-NTD-induced perturbation of the propeller angles. 12 We also analyzed the population distributions of the local base-pair parameters for the 25 replicas of dsNS and dsTRS in their free and N-NTD-bound states. Figure S13 shows that the WC base-pairing perturbations observed in runs 5, 8, 17, and 25 for dsTRS due to N-NTD binding was also seen for the fully unbiased distribution generated from the 25 replicas. Nevertheless, an opposite effect occurred for dsNS, for which the angle and distance parameters exhibited characteristics of stability and/or slight fluctuations around the equilibrium population. Figure 5C ). An investigation of the motions filtered from the eigenvectors of PC1 and PC2 revealed that dsTRS-bound N-NTD exhibited the largest conformational dynamics when compared to free and dsNSbound N-NTD, which were similar ( Figure 5D and 5E). We highlight that the most evident motions took place in the N-and C-termini as well as the basic finger (β2-β3 loop) for both free and dsRNA-bound N-NTD. However, the eigenvectors of PC1 and PC2 for the N-NTD:dsTRS complex suggested a wide motion between the basic finger and the 2-β5 loop, located at the palm, similar to a tweezer. Interestingly, this tweezer-like motion was intrinsic to the residues located at the dsRNA-binding cleft in N-NTD ( Figure 1A ).Our results of conformational flexibility from RMSF and PCA for free and dsRNAbound N-NTD corroborated each other and suggest a significant contribution of the N-and C-termini and the basic finger (β2-β3 loop) to N-NTD dynamics. They also revealed that N-NTD interaction with dsTRS led to a general gain in protein conformational flexibility when compared to its free state. We suggest that this flexibility gain of dsTRS-bound N-NTD over 25 replicas of concatenated simulations may be a key structural factor to 14 promote dsTRS WC base-pairing destabilization upon N-NTD binding, as determined by the break of intramolecular hydrogen bonds ( Figure 2B and 3A) and perturbation of the local base-pair parameters (Figure 4 ). Increasing N-NTD concentration led to the dsRNA melting curve, which is characterized by an exponential decay of FRET efficiency as a function of N-NTD concentration. The melting curves reached either zero, for an N-NTD construct that contains the C-terminal serine/arginine (SR)-rich motif, or a plateau, for N-NTD itself (10) .Since the FRET efficiency is a measure of the molar fraction of dsRNA, in the simulated kinetic models presented here, we report the molar fraction of dsRNA as a 15 function of N-NTD concentration, simulating the dsRNA melting curve. We used the software Kinetiscope (http://hinsberg.net/kinetiscope/), which is based on a stochastic algorithm developed by Bunker (24) and Gillespie (25) . We used the elementary rate constants for individual chemical steps to produce an absolute time base ( Figure 6A ). The starting condition mimics exactly the experimental condition, varying the concentration of N-NTD over 50 nM dsRNA (dsTRS). The predictions were validated by direct comparison to the experimental data (10) .To simulate the melting curve, we had to constrain the kinetic space, which is large because each model is composed by 6 reactions and 12 individual rate constants, assuming the following boundaries: (B1) the kinetic model must be complete, complying all possible reactions for a given mechanism; (B2) the presence of N-NTD must lead to catalysis, with the melting of dsRNA being faster than the annealing reaction; (B3) the equilibrium of the annealing is shifted toward the dsRNA; and (B4) the equilibrium for the melting activity must be reached in few seconds or less to be efficient in the cellular environment.The criterion for choosing the rate constants for the annealing reaction (R1, Figure   6 ) was that it must be significantly slower than the melting activity (catalysis). Since to our knowledge, there is no experimental kinetic rate constant available for the annealing of dsTRS, we fixed for the simulations a k off = 8×10 -4 s -1 , which is the experimental value of the dissociation rate constant observed for the almost inactive Y127A N-NTD+SR mutant (10) . This mutant has a melting activity of hours, while our simulation showed melting activities of few seconds ( Figure 6B ). To yield an equilibrium shifted toward the dsRNA, we used k on = 4×10 -1 M -1 s -1 , which is true below the melting temperature of the dsRNA.Any values of k off < 1 s -1 , with an association constant K a , gives the same molar fraction of dsRNA.We constrained the binding reactions R2 and R3 of N-NTD to the sense (TRS) and antisense (cTRS) single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) ( Figure 6A ) based on the published experimental values for these association constants (10, 21) . Since these values were very similar, to simplify the simulation, we used the same K a for both reactions (K a = 4×10 7 M -1 ). Note that k on < 10 6 M -1 s -1 makes the reaction too slow to reach equilibrium, violating boundary B4 (Figures S14A and S16B ).For dsRNA (dsTRS) binding, there was no experimental data to constrain the simulation. However, simulations unambiguously showed that K a for reaction R4 must be of the same order of that for ssRNAs, leading to the allowed ranges depicted in Figure 6A .We also determined k on based on the simulations, taking boundaries B2 and B4 into consideration, which were also considered for reactions R1 to R3 (Figure S14B, S15A and S16B).All the constraints applied to reactions R1 to R4 are valid for both kinetic models (models 1 and 2). Conversely, reactions R5 and R6 are specific for each kinetic model, being essential to comply with boundary B1.For model 1, there is no experimental data available to constrain reactions R5 and R6, but the simulations showed that they are tightly related to reactions R2 and R3, being both K a and k off of the same order of magnitude for reactions R2 and R3 ( Figure S14C ).Note that there is an intricate relationship between the formation of ssRNA-bound states (C2 and C3) and the decrease of free or bound dsRNA (dsTRS and C4). To illustrate this relationship, Figure 6B shows the kinetics at three concentrations of N-NTD. The simulated melting curves for model 1 resembled the near exponential decay observed experimentally ( Figure 6C, left) . Interestingly, when k off of reactions R5 and R6 were bigger than k off for reactions R2 and R3, we observed a plateau in the exponential decay of the dsRNA melting curve ( Figure 6C ). Remarkably, melting curves that either decayed to zero or reached a plateau was observed experimentally, as mentioned before (10) . It is worth mentioning that the kinetic model 1 is fully compatible with the experimental data by Grossoehme et al.(2009) (10), as well as with the mechanism suggested by the MD simulations, in which one N-NTD can initiate dsRNA melting, destabilizing the WC base-pairing.We also evaluated kinetic model 2. This mechanism for N-NTD melting activity was suggested in the conclusion scheme drawn in the paper by Grossoehme To build a kinetic model that would exclusively produce ssRNA from the sandwiched dsRNA, we had to replace reactions R5 and R6 of kinetic model 1. In the new model, reaction R5 forms the sandwiched dsRNA (C5, Figure 6A ) and reaction R6 is the dissociation of C5 into the ssRNA-bound N-NTDs (C2 and C3, Figure 6A ). To simulate N-NTD melting activity considering model 2, we used the same boundaries described earlier (B1, B2, B3 and B4), with reactions R1 to R4 having almost the same constraints described for model 1.Reaction R5 and R6 of model 2 has no parallel to any other reaction. We scanned all the kinetic space that led to the catalysis of melting activity and observed two contrasting situations. The first is when reaction R6 equilibrium is between 10 -6 and 10 7 M -1 , always having the dissociated forms C2 and C3 available and making the melting curve very stiff (model 2a). The second is the opposite situation, where equilibrium is skilled toward the sandwich state (C5) with K a > 10 7 M -1 (model 2b). Figure 6C illustrates the melting curves obtained for the two situations.Model 2a is characterized for the high efficiency in the dissociation of the dsRNA, k on and k off can assume any value. Particularly for model 2a, the kinetic of dsRNA melting is also independent of k on for reactions R2 and R3, at fixed concentrations of N-NTD. All simulated conditions led to the curve in red ( Figure 6C ), in which, the minimal amount of N-NTD (10 nM) led to complete dissociation of the dsRNA (molar fraction of zero). Figure   S15 illustrates all the simulated boundaries. Note that for model 2a, there is never an accumulation of C5 ( Figure S15C ).Model 2b corresponds to when the equilibrium of reaction R6 is shifted toward C5 (K a > 10 7 M -1 ). Figure S16 illustrates the reaction boundaries. In this situation, we were able to observe a melting curve ( Figure 6C , blue) with a near exponential decay at a low concentration of N-NTD and a near exponential rise at higher concentrations of N-NTD. for model 2b. We determined that k on has to be > 10 7 s -1 to keep up with boundaries B2 and B4. For the melting activity to take place, the equilibrium of reaction R5 was shifted toward C5 (K a > 1, for model 2a or 10 7 M -1 for model 2b) (Figure S15B and S16C). In the present work, we used computational simulations to unravel the dsRNA melting activity of the isolated SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD. Our molecular dynamics data suggested that, during interaction with dsRNA, protein dynamics drives the destabilization of hydrogen bonds involved in the WC RNA base-pairing, probably in a 1:1 stoichiometry (N-NTD:dsRNA). We also showed that the capacity of N-NTD to break the WC basepairing was sequence-specific, being more efficient for dsTRS (5'-UCUAAAC-3') than for a non-specific (NS) sequence (5'-CACUGAC-3'). To further explore the N-NTD:dsRNA stoichiometry, we constructed kinectic models based on experimental data by Grossoehme et al (2009) (10) . Remarkably, the model using a 1:1 stoichiometry greatly fits the experimental data, reinforcing the mechanism we hypothesize here.The strategy of performing 25 100 ns-molecular dynamics simulations with the same starting structure but different seeds of the random number generator provided a large sampling of conformational space of each molecular system (N-NTD, dsRNAs, and N-NTD/dsRNA complexes). This set of theoretical data ensured a statistically significant result showing that N-NTD destabilizes the WC base-pairing, especially for dsTRS, through the replacement of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the dsRNA strands by intermolecular hydrogen bonds between N-NTD and the nitrogenous bases of each RNA strand. The results also revealed unbiasedly that the rigid-body geometric parameters of the WC base-pairing were significantly changed due to N-NTD binding.One notable N-NTD structural feature is the presence of a significant number of loops; only 32 out of 140 residues are involved in secondary structure (16, 26) . This is a typical feature of a dynamic protein. In fact, our results revealed that N-NTD is a plastic protein, with the N and C-termini and the β2-β3 loop (finger) as the most prominent dynamic regions. For the N-NTD:dsTRS interaction, a remarkable tweezer-like motion 20 between the finger and the 2-β5 loop could be related to the sequence-specific WC basepairing destabilization. This led us to hypothesize that, following formation of the N-NTD:dsTRS complex, the tweezer-like motion resulted from intrinsic protein dynamics might promote a steric effect causing a ""compaction pressure"" on the dsRNA strands. This might expose residues from the bottom of palm (finger/ 2-β5 cleft) allowing their interaction with the bases, leading to destabilization of the WC base-pairing (Figure 7 ).To confirm the mechanism emerged from the MD simulations, where only one molecule of N-NTD was enough to initiate dsRNA melting, we constructed kinetic models considering two possible scenarios: a stoichiometry of 1:1 or 2:1 for N-NTD and dsRNA.The 2:1 stoichiometry is more intuitive since N protein is dimeric in solution (27) . To perform the docking, we took advantage of experimental data previously Next, the structural model of the N-NTD:dsTRS (5'-UCUAAAC-3') complex was generated from the lowest-energy structure of the N-NTD:dsNS complex, derived from the cluster with the lowest HADDOCK score, by mutating the dsRNA sequence using w3DNA (29) . Therefore, both complexes have identical geometries, varying only the dsRNA sequences. Structural conformation of the constructed model for N-NTD:dsTRS complex was displayed using the web application http://skmatic.x3dna.org for easy creation of DSSR (Dissecting the Spatial Structure of RNA)-PyMOL schematics (32) .Molecular dynamics (MD) calculations for N-NTD, dsRNAs, and N-NTD:dsRNA complexes were performed using GROMACS (version 5.0.7) (33) . The molecular systems were modeled with the corrected AMBER14-OL15 package, including the ff14sb protein (34) and ff99bsc0χ OL3 +OL15 nucleic acid (35, 36) force fields, as well as the TIP3P water model (37) . The structural models of N-NTD (PDB 6YI3), dsRNAs (mutated PDB 4U37), and N-NTD:dsRNA complexes (from molecular docking) were placed in the center of a cubic box solvated by a solution of 50 mM NaCl in water. The protonation state of ionizable residues was set according to the PROPKA server (30) considering pH 7.0.Periodic boundary conditions were used and all simulations were performed in NPT ensemble, keeping the system at 298 K and 1.0 bar using Nose-Hoover thermostat (τ T = 2 ps) and Parrinello-Rahman barostat (τ P = 2 ps and compressibility = 4.510 -5 ·bar -1 ). A 23 cutoff of 12 Å for both Lennard-Jones and Coulomb potentials was used. The long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm.In every MD simulation, a time step of 2.0 fs was used and all covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained to their equilibrium distance. A conjugate gradient minimization algorithm was used to relax the superposition of atoms generated in the box construction process. Energy minimizations were carried out with steepest descent integrator and conjugate gradient algorithm, using 1,000 kJ·mol -1 ·nm -1 as maximum force criterion. One hundred thousand steps of molecular dynamics were performed for each directly with the N-NTD. We suggest that this activity is a consequence of intrinsic dynamics of N-NTD, especially because the tweezer-like motion between β2-β3 (finger) 34 and 2-β5 loops. The protein is denoted as cartoon with the helix-and β-strand secondary structures colored in cyan and orange, respectively. The dsRNA is showed as a line model with the complementary strands colored in red and blue. The tweezer-like motion between the finger and 2-β5 loop is indicated by bidirectional arrows colored in magenta.",Brazil,first author,2020-09-06,9
598d6213d84331e5aeba2734bdba61fadb899049,Dealing with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a Rapid Response Team operation in Brazil: Quality in practice,"The 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) epidemic has spread throughout China and, secondarily, also outside of China, with a basic reproductive number estimated at 2.21 to 3.32 and a mortality rate of approximately 2.3% (1) . Up to June 4, 2020, more than 6.5 million cases of COVID-19 infection have been reported worldwide. Of these, 584,016 were reported in Brazil (2) . Available data suggest that up to 20% of patients with COVID-19 develop a critical illness, primarily characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (3) .The rapid response teams (RRTs) consist of health professionals exclusively dedicated to providing care to hospitalized patients identified at being high risk of worsening, using criteria of the severity of illness and clinical deterioration, with MEWS (Modified Early Warning Score) being one of the most frequently used scores (4) . These scores are implemented aiming to prevent cardiac arrest in patients admitted to hospital wards, as well as to reduce mortality (5) . Failure to detect clinical deterioration can decrease RRT effectiveness.To date, several studies have described the demographic, clinical, and biological characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and radiological or pathological findings associated with COVID-19. However, so far, no article has been published describing the marked impact of the pandemic on the rapid response team operation in hospital wards. This brief report seeks to present the analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a rapid response team operation from a large quaternary hospital in Brazil.Study design and participants: This observational study took place at a large tertiary-care hospital, in the city of Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil, a 400-bed general hospital, with six intensive care units, and approximately 1,600 admissions per month. The institution's RRT originally comprised two simultaneous on-duty professionals with intensive care experience, which, during the pandemic period, was expanded to four simultaneous on-duty professionals. Over the course of the study period, ICU capacity was increased from 44 to 96 beds. When the study was being carried out (May 14, 2020), the hospital had 358 inpatients, with 314 confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19. The first confirmed case of COVID19 in Ceará occurred on March 15, 2020. Patients were admitted primarily through the emergency department from the entire state of Ceará. We identified rapid response team calls in adult patients in the wards (aged ≥18 years) carried out from January 1, 2019, to May 14, 2020.Procedures: The data were collected directly from the electronic medical records related to cases treated by the rapid response team. Using a standardized case record form, we recorded data on demographics, degree of severity of illness according to institutional classification, vital signs, and patient outcomes (death and referral to ICU). Data were also collected from the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) to evaluate patient severity of illness: scores two and three were considered medium severity and four or more high severity (4). Ethical Aspects: The study was submitted for ethical assessment of the National Research Ethics Commission and was approved under number 66415317.9.0000.5049.In total, 15,461 cases treated by the RRT were evaluated during the study period, of which 56.3% were females. The mean age of the patients was 67 years, with a standard deviation of 21 years. After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of treated cases increased, going from an average of 30.6 cases treated daily to 79.2.Similarly, the number of patients with an extremely critical clinical condition also increased, from an average of 3.5 daily cases of patients with this profile to 22 cases.The increase in the degree of severity of illness can also be observed with the decrease in the proportion of moderate severity codes, which went from 34.11% to 25.43%, and an increase in the proportion of high severity (10.47 to 20 %, p-value <0.001). Also, the MEWS median went from 1 (IQR 1-2) to 2 (IQR 2-3), with a p-value <0.001, as well as the percentage of patients who were referred to the ICU increased from 2.29% to 6.23% (p-value <0.001). During the COVID pandemic a weekly average of 14.0 patients were admitted to the ICU compared to 5.8 admissions per week prior to the pandemic. Finally, the number of deaths decreased slightly, but without statistical significance (p = 0.991).To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on RRT operations. In this brief report, we identified that the number of cases treated by the RRT during the pandemic period increased 2.6-fold in relation to the period prior to the pandemic. The severity of illness of the treated patients also increased two-fold in relation to the previous period, leading to a scenario of a higher number of treated patients and more severely-ill individuals within the same day. Even in the face of this scenario, the mortality of treated patients remained unaltered.The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a higher occupancy rate of hospital units than previously observed, as well as turning these units to places that are practically exclusive for patients with this disease (6) . In addition to generating an unexpectedly high demand for health services, COVID-19 also frequently leads patients to critical and severe clinical conditions (7) . These combined factors may explain the almost exponential increase in RRT-treated cases during the observed period, as well as the higher than six-fold increase in the average of critical illness cases treated daily. The increase of almost three-fold in the number of referrals of patients to ICU is also in accordance with the existing literature to date (8) .Even with the increase observed in the volume and complexity of care, the number of deaths has not increased. Probably, the resizing that occurred in the studied RRT, which went from 2 to 4 simultaneous on-duty medical professionals, was important to maintain the intervention effectiveness in reducing mortality (5, 9) .One of the limitations that can be considered in this work is the lack of confounding factor control in relation to other factors that could determine the observed change. However, as 87% of the patients admitted to the institution at the time of the analysis were patients with COVID-19, it is likely that the COVID-19 pandemic is the main factor associated with the change.We conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant increase in the density of care provided by the RRTs, as well as doubled the severity of illness and complexity of patients. The observation of these data is important for hospital managers to adjust the size of their RRTs according to the new scenario, aiming to maintain the intervention effectiveness.The data underlying this article cannot be shared publicly due to Brazilian research laws. The data will be shared on reasonable request to the corresponding author.",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-30,9
c3b53c2c31e0e194cdc261361cdd1e0dc3429d4c,Journal Pre-proof COVID-19 Detection in CT Images with Deep Learning: A Voting-based Scheme and Cross-Datasets Analysis COVID-19 Detection in CT Images with Deep Learning: A Voting-based Scheme and Cross-Datasets Analysis,"Treating the slices independently means that the same patient may appear in the training and test sets at the same time which may produce misleading results. It also raises the question of whether the scans from the same patient should be evaluated as a group or not. Moreover, using a single dataset raises concerns about the generalization of the methods. Different datasets tend to present images of varying quality which may come from different types of CT machines reflecting the conditions of the countries and cities from where they come from. In order to address these two problems, in this work, we propose an Efficient Deep Learning Technique for the screening of COVID-19 with a voting-based approach. In this approach, the images from a given patient are classified as group in a voting system. The approach is tested in the two biggestIn March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic.COVID-19 is highly infectious and can potentially evolve to fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Early detection and diagnosis is a critical factor 5 to control the COVID-19 spreading. The most common screening method to detect it is the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing.However, it is a laborious method and some studies reported its low sensitivity in early stages [1] .Chest scans such as X-rays and Computer tomography (CT) scans have been 10 used to identify morphological patterns of lung lesions linked to the COVID-19.However, the accuracy of the diagnosis of COVID-19 by Chest scans strongly depends on experts [2] and Deep learning techniques have been studied as a tool to automate and help with the diagnosis [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] .A computed tomography scan, or CT scan, produces detailed images of or-15 gans, bones, soft tissues and blood vessels. CT images allow physicians to identify internal structures and see their shape, size, density and texture. Different from conventional X-Rays, CT scans produce a set of slices of a given region of 2 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the body without overlaying the different body structures. Thus, CT scans give a much more detailed picture of the patient's condition than the conventional 20 X-Rays. This detailed information can be used to determine whether there is a medical problem as well as the extent and exact location of the problem.For these reasons, a number of deep learning based methodologies have been recently proposed for COVID-19 screening in CT scans [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] .The main bottleneck for the realization of a study such as the ones cited 25 above is the lack of good quality comprehensive data sets. Possibly the first attempt to create such a data set was the so-called COVID-CT dataset [15] which consists of images mined from research papers. Different versions of this dataset were used in [9, 10, 11, 12] . For its most updated version, the highest reported accuracy, F1-score, and AUC were 86%, 85%, and 94% [9] , 30 respectively. More recently, Soares et al. [14] made another set of CT scans publicly available. It consists of 2482 CT scans taken from hospitals in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. They have reported an accuracy, sensitivity, and positive predictive value of 97.38%, 95.53%, and 99.16%, respectively.These two datasets are, to date, the biggest publicly available datasets. It 35 can be seen that the difference in the best results obtained in each of them is significant which raises two questions: (i) Are the discrepancies in the results due to the differences in the datasets? (ii) Does a model trained in one dataset have good performance when tested with the other? This work aims to answer these two questions.Another drawback of the best performing techniques is their immense number of parameters which directly influence their footprint and latency. Improving these two metrics allows the model to be more easily embedded in mobile applications and to be less of a burden on the server if provided as a web-service receiving an enormous number of requests per second. In addition, having a 45 more compact baseline model allows the exploitation of higher resolution inputs without making the computational cost prohibitively high. Broadly speaking, the computational cost is an important factor in the accessibility and availability of the the technology to the public. To produce an efficient model we exploit and extend the EfficientNet Family of deep artificial neural networks along with a data augmentation process and 55 transfer learning. Following previous evaluation protocols [9, 14] , state-of-theart results are presented for the COVID-CT dataset (accuracy of 87.60%) and the SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan dataset (accuracy of 98.99%). The voting based approach showed promising results for the Covid-19 detection in CT images.The remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section 2 present the de-60 tails of COVID-CT [15] and SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan [14] datasets. The methodology is described in Section 3 and the experiments along with the results in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusion of this work.This section describes the two datasets considered in this work. To the best 65 of our knowledge, these are the two largest public datasets to date.The SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan dataset [14] consists of 2482 CT scans from 120 patients, with 1252 CT scans of 60 patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 from males (32) and females (28), and 1230 CT scan images of 60 non-infected patients by This dataset also lacks standardization regarding the contrast of the images, as can be seen in Figure 2 . For method evaluation, the protocol presented in [14] 4 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f proposes to randomly divide the dataset in training (80%) and test (20%) partitions. The dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/plameneduardo/ 80 sarscov2-ctscan-dataset.A protocol is proposed for the creation of training, validation, and test sets. In this section, the proposed methodology for COVID-19 screening based on CT scans is presented. To this end, we extended an architecture of the Effiecient-Net family and we trained the models with CT images from healthy and SaR-7 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fCoV-2 infected patients. The CT images come from the datasets described in 115 the previous section and undergo the pre-processing procedure described below.Pre-processing is a very common process in computer vision applications.Pre-processing techniques can be useful for removing unwanted noise, emphasize aspects of the image that can help with the recognition task, or even help with 120 the deep learning training phase.In this work, a simple pixel intensity normalization in the range of [0, 1]is applied. This pre-processing is necessary for model convergence during the training phase.For convolutional network models, the input images are often resized to 125 maintain compatibility with the network architectures. Since EfficientNets have a low computational cost in terms of latency and memory, it makes it possible to exploit higher resolution input images. Thus, we also investigate the impact of varying the input resolution in the quality of the model. In this way, this pre-processing step becomes another parameter of the network. The EfficientNets are a family of artificial neural networks in which the basic building block is the Mobile Inverted Bottleneck Conv Block, MBconv [16] , as depicted in Figure 5 . model. The main idea to achieve the EfficientNet architecture was to start from one high quality yet compact baseline model presented in Table 2 [16] . DWConv stands for depthwise conv, k3x3/k5x5 defines the kernel size, BN is batch normalization, HxW xF represents the tensor shape (height, width, depth), and x1/2/3/4 is the multiplier for number of repeated layers. In [18] , four new blocks are added to the baseline model to improve COVID-19 recognition on x-ray images. Here, we proposed modifications aimed at CT images, and six new blocks are added to an EfficientNet B0 architecture. These blocks were achieved by a grid search and can be seen in Two searches are carried out. One aiming at a shallower architecture (number of layers clipped to 4) and the other deeper.On top of the model a new fully connected layer (FC) is added to adapt the classification task to a new domain. We highlight the following operations that The batch normalization operation constrains the output of the layer in a The swish activation produces a smooth curve during the minimization loss process and contrary to that, the ReLu produces an abrupt change. Also, the swish function does not zero out small negative values. We believe those factors 170 may be relevant for capturing patterns underlying the data [21] .Due to its complexity, Deep learning models require a large number of instances to avoid overfitting. However, for the majority of real-life problems, data is not abundant. In fact, few are the situations where there is an abundance of 175 data, such as the ImageNet [22] dataset. To overcome this issue, one could rely on two techniques: data augmentation and transfer learning. In this work, we made use of both techniques and we describe below.Data augmentation consists of increasing the training samples by transform- domains/problems that can be reused [24] . In the present work, we have few images to carry out the training, especially of the COVID-19 class. Thus, transfer learning becomes imperative.Our models inherit several layers from EfficientNet (See Table2) and the new layers are randomly initialized with zero mean. EfficientNets were originally 195 trained for the Imagenet dataset [22] . Thus, we follow the steps to transfer leanring from one domain to another: Five metrics are used here to evaluate models: accuracy (Acc), COVID-19 sensitivity (Se C ), COVID-19 positive prediction (+P C ), F1-score (F 1), and Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AU C), i.e., .Higher the AUC, better the model is at distinguishing among image categories.Experiments were carried on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5820K CPU 3.30GHz,64GB Ram, one Titan X Pascal with 12GB, and the TensorFlow/Keras framework for Python. The source code and pre-trained models are available in https://github.com/ufopcsilab/EfficientCovidNet. In the following subsections, we present the three experimental setups explored in this work. The training model start with a learning rate of 0.001 with the Adam Optimizer for 20 epochs 220 using the categorical cross-entropy loss.In a first setup, in Section 4.1, we investigate the discrepancy regarding the results reported by the methods considered state-of-the-art for the two studied datasets. The best approach for the COVID-CT dataset reports 86.0% of accuracy [9] . For the SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan dataset, the state-of-the-art method 225 achieves 97.38% of accuracy [14] . However, the SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan dataset has significantly more images than the COVID-CT dataset and the same number of patients (individuals). To assess whether this difference is due to the evaluation protocol, we perform two experiments. We investigate the impact of selecting samples/images for training and test sets at random and in a second Following the protocol proposed in [14] the data were divided into training, validation and test. The proposed approach in this work enhanced all metrics on test set as shown in Table 5 . Despite the outstanding results presented in Table 5 , we believe that such results are overestimated. Upon this fact, we introduce a 5-fold classification 265 and some changes in the original protocol as described and with the results presented in Table 6 . The ""Random"" evaluation presents better results when compared to the two other approaches (""Slice"" and ""Voting""). One of the reasons is due to data from the same patient/individual in both training and test sets, which leads to an 270 overestimated result. Upon this fact, our hypothesis is that an approach tends to learn the patterns related to the individuals instead the COVID patterns.In the ""Slice"" evaluation, the samples are classified as an isolated instance, such as the ""Random"" one but ensuring that all samples of an individual are exclusively present only on one data partition: training or test set. A down-grade is observed which clearly shows an overestimation from the ""Random"" evaluation.On the opposite to the ""Slice"" evaluation, the ""Voting"" one considers all images of an individual to decide whether the individual is infected or not. It is worth to emphasize that the same model is used in both approaches, that is, 280 the model trained by image (only one "" slice "" of the lung).Due to the nature of CT scans, we believe the disease patterns will not manifest in all slices (instance/images) of an individual CT exam, and results of ""Slice"" and ""Voting"" evaluation reflect that. We believe this can generate false positives/false negatives and therefore impact the figures of approaches 285 (See Table 6 . Besides, this problem can be seen as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem [25] and that a MIL-based approach can be a promising path for future work.Comparing the results of both Tables 5 and 6 the COVID-CT training partition as a test and also combining both partitions from the COVID-CT dataset as a larger test set (See Table 7 ). We also test the opposite scenario, in which we use all images from the COVID-CT dataset [15] for training and all images of SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan dataset [14] to test.As one can see, the model performance is drastically reduced when we compare cross-dataset evaluation against an intra dataset one. We believe that the reason for this behavior is due to data acquisition diversity. Images from different datasets can be acquired by different equipment, different image sensors, and thus, change relevant features on the images impairing recognition. The 315 model could learn how to identify portions and patterns of one image that may Training on COVID-CT [15] and testing in SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan dataset [14] presents even worse results since COVID-CT training set is smaller. 320 We believe such test should be mandatory for all methods aiming at COVID-19 recognition with CT images, since it is the one that most resembles a real test.In In Table 8 , we report the results of the proposed approach using the pro-335 tocol described in [15] . One may observe that the experiments with the same approach used in Setups 1 and 2 (EfficientNet-B3) has a worse performance when compared with the ones available in the literature.Aiming to reduce the incidence of overfitting during training of ""Architecture 1"", we propose a deeper network. In most of the cases, when the deeper network 340 is used (see ""Architecture 2"" in Table 8 ), rather than a Architecture 1 one (see ""Architecture 1"" in Table 8 ), a gain is observed on all reported figures. The best model is the one with the Architecture 2 with input size of 500x500(source available at https://github.com/ufopcsilab/EfficientCovidNet).The ROC curve of the model is presented in Figure 8 . 345 We present in Table 9 a comparison of the best proposed approach against the ones available in the literature. Despite the results presented by Amyar et al.[12] and Mobiny et al. [10] , both evaluated their approach with only 105 images (47 COVID and 58 NonCovid) and, therefore, they cannot be directly compared to the present work. Thus, the best results previously obtained in 350 this setup were presented in [9] . Although the work proposed here overcomes it in terms of accuracy and F1-score on COVID-CT dataset using a significantly smaller model ( 3 × smaller). The base model proposed in [9] needs 14,149,480 parameters while the one proposed here only 4,779,038 parameters. The training loss curves for the best model can be seen in Figure 9 .In this work, a model for the detection of COVID-19 patterns in CT images, namely EffiecintCovidNet, is proposed along with a voting based approach and a cross-dataset analysis. The proposed model presents comparable results to the state-of-the-art methods and the highest accuracy to date on both datasets.Also, it is three times smaller (with 4.78 million parameters against 14.15 million of He et al. [9] ) and has a latency of 0.010 seconds. This model could enable the use on devices with low computational power, such as smartphones and tablets or even facilitate integration with the Radiology PACS.Our model was evaluated on three setups and with the two largest public 365 datasets, including a cross-dataset analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to carry out such analysis for the present task and we believe that this is a major contribution of our work. The cross-dataset approach is of paramount importance for the methods aiming to detect COVID-19 in CT images since the approach resembles a real scenario and unveils the limitations In this study, we show the potential of Deep Learning models for the task of COVID-19 detection on CT images. We also emphasize that larger and more diverse datasets are needed in order to evaluate the methods in a more realistic manner. As a future research path, we intend to build a very large CT 380 image datasets from several Brazilian centers, in order to try to cover a larger spectrum of equipment (sensors), ethnic groups and acquisition processes and thus, properly validate our method.The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or 385 personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.",Brazil,first author,2020-09-14,9
dcb9687688c8f41fedfb56ac8c04b4f4c944b373,Evaluation of COVID-19 Surveillance Strategy in Ecuador,"I n late December 2020, the Chinese government reported the presence of an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in the Wuhan region. On February, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 . By the end of March, most countries already had cases of this disease. As part of the control actions, the countries began to carry out diagnostic tests, under the WHO indications. The Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health (MPH) implemented the application of diagnostic tests, aimed at cases with clinical symptoms compatible with COVID-19.To face the COVID-19 pandemic, several governments took into account the model described as the ""Oxford Study,"" which conceives a way of acting to ""flatten the curve"" (referring to the contagion curve), 1 which consists of imposing more extreme social withdrawal measures if the income in intensive care units (ICUs) increases, and softening them if they decrease, assuming that sooner or later the majority of the population will develop the infection.However, it is known of the existence of other models that, in addition to the implementation of social isolation measures, involve the search for the symptomatic population, massively practicing tests to detect the infection in the initial stages. 2 According to the WHO (2020), any case confirmed by the laboratory, regardless of clinical signs or symptoms, is considered a positive COVID-19 case. 3 In Ecuador, the case definition is practically the same, but health workers are restricted to applying laboratory tests only to those patients who present symptoms. This measure suggests the systematic exclusion of the asymptomatic population, without it being integrated, in any way, as part of the epidemiological strategy to stop transmission in the community.On the basis of the above, this article aims to evaluate the relevance of this model of detection of positive cases of COVID-19 implemented by the Ecuadorian MPH and to compare it with those of the other countries that decided to carry out diagnostic tests on asymptomatic patients and suspicious contacts. For this purpose, the information produced by the Ministry of Public Health of Ecuador was used. 4 The statistical evaluations presented in this article are based on probability analyses, determined using Bayes' Theorem, where the results are represented with numbers between 0 and 1. The formulations were carried out under the Conditioned Probability modality, that is, probability of an event A occurring when an event B occurs. The estimates were oriented to try to specify the type of relationship between the variables ""COVID-19 tests applied"" and the ""possibility of occurrence of a positive COVID-19 case."" According to WHO, 5 a case is considered as positive COVID-19 if it is confirmed by laboratory, independent of clinical signs or symptoms.Bayes' Theorem is formulated as follows 6 :where P(A) is the probability of event A, P(B) is the probability of event B, P (A|B) is the probability of observing event A if B is true; and, P(B|A) is the probability of observing event B if A is true.In this case, Pa represents COVID-19 confirmed patients with obvious signs of infection, while Pb represents confirmed patients with COVID-19 who had no obvious signs of infection or any type of symptoms.This gives rise to 2 differentiated approaches that would consist of the observation of:1. Pa (symptomatic | examined) þ Pb (asymptomatic | examined)In the first case, it would be based on a principle of randomness (symptomatic þ nonsymptomatic), and in the second, selectivity (symptomatic).With this in mind, the possibility of occurrence obtained in Ecuador, based on the second principle (selectivity), was compared-thanks to the reports issued periodically by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health on COVID-19 positive cases-with the cases of South Korea and Iceland, based on the first principle (randomness), until April 13, 2020. 7, 8 All the COVID-19 tests applied in relation to the confirmed cases per million inhabitants were determined in the 3 countries.Dates of Applied COVID-19 Tests.In Ecuador, from March 31 to April 13, 2020, a total of 24,553 COVID-19 tests were carried out, obtaining a total of 7529 COVID-19 confirmed patients. 4 Taking into account the size of the country's population (17,468,736 people), it is observed that, between March 31 and April 13, 2020, there was a growth that exceeded 472 test/million inhabitants to 1406 test/million inhabitants ( Figure 1 ). The average positivity found is: Pa = 0.26 ± 0.33.For comparative purposes, this selective approach based on the study of the proportion of confirmed cases of COVID-19 only among the symptomatic (Pa), was compared with the randomized approach used by Iceland and South Korea, which tested both symptomatic and nonsymptomatic (Pa þ Pb). As results, during this period, Korea applied 534,552 tests and obtained 10,519 positive COVID-19 cases (Pa þ Pb = 0.020); Iceland performed 36,339 tests and obtained 1720 positive cases (Pa þ Pb = 0.047); and Ecuador carried out 24,553 tests and obtained 7529 positive cases (Pa = 0.307). When comparing the results of Ecuador with respect to with Korea and Iceland, it is inferred that Pa (symptomatic | examined) has a greater probability than Pb (nonsymptomatic | examined). Thus, in cases with obvious symptoms of COVID-19, a significant correlation with the positivity of the test will be observed more frequently (Figure 2 ).As seen, the number of positive cases of COVID-19 in Iceland and South Korea are, in relative terms, lower than those observed in Ecuador: 0.05, 0.02, and 0.30, respectively. Although it is evident that the performance of diagnostic tests directed only at symptomatic patients may have a high probability of positivity, this does not contribute to the control of the epidemic at the community level.In addition, the Ecuadorian public health network had insufficient COVID-19 tests, a condition that is measured as sufficient tests applied for each hundred thousand or million inhabitants and that allows determining the effectiveness and efficiency of the actions of public entities. This meant that the Pa (symptomatic | examined) ratio was not more likely to be met, because many symptomatic patients were examined but were left without a diagnosis. In addition, as seen, Ecuador experienced a supply shortage of synthetic fiber swabs that caused diagnosis disruption. 9 Lack of testing was not the only issue with SARS-CoV2 surveillance failure, but quality of testing. Regulations for endorsed diagnostic kits in Ecuador are weak, and affect the quality of diagnosis in terms of sensitivity. So far, the positive rate may be even higher as low sensitivity SARS-CoV2 are widely used in this country. 10 Consequently, the daily reports on the behavior of the COVID-19 issued by the Ecuadorian government do not adequately represent the growth in the number of infected persons each day, nor the actual behavior of the epidemic, affecting possible control measures.

b2870419d38a29442c1a001033f36a2d575d464c,Early Impact of social distancing in response to COVID-19 on hospitalizations for acute bronchiolitis in infants in Brazil,"According to the World Health Organization's ""COVID-19 strategy update"", health authorities should adopt and adapt measures of distance and movement restrictions at the population level, besides other public health measures to reduce exposure and suppress virus transmission. [1] Such measures may impact on the epidemiology of a variety of other diseases.Acute bronchiolitis (AB) is among the main communicable diseases of childhood and is the most frequent cause of hospitalization in infants worldwide. [2] In Brazil, AB represented around 6% of total hospitalizations in the age group under one year old between the 2008-2015 period. [3] Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the main etiologic agent and has high transmissibility, especially in autumn-winter months. [2] Due to the seasonal epidemiology of bronchiolitis and regional differences, the peak incidence of hospitalizations is different throughout Brazil, between the months of February and August. [3] The COVID-19 pandemic hit Brazil in February 2020, just before autumn-winter in the southern hemisphere (March to September) with the first case officially registered in São Paulo. Collective measures to contain the pandemic were implemented in the middle of March: social distancing, restriction of commerce activities and non-essential services. Suspension of teaching activities at all educational levels throughout the country started by mid-March. Additionally, besides overall hygiene measures and mask protection strategies [4] (with variable degrees of adherence by the population), children have stayed out of schools and daycare centers, since all has been closed since then.A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 4 Considering the repercussion of these unique social experiences in infants' health, this study aims to assess the early impact of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic on bronchiolitis hospitalizations in infants under one year old, in a large country as Brazil. -AB-ICDJ21) were used, for the age group of < 1 year old. These data were also analyzed by macro-regions of Brazil (North, Northeast, Southeast, South and Midwest) and in the months of January, February, March, April, May and June of each year, since this covers the typical season of high AB hospitalizations. In order to assess the reliability of the report, ICDP96 -other conditions originating in the perinatal period (congenital renal failure, neonatal withdrawal symptoms, wide cranial sutures of newborn, termination of pregnancy e.g.) was used as comparisson, since social distancing measures are not expected to have a major impact on these conditions.To calculate the incidence of hospitalizations in the public heath system, we used the [7] In addition to the closing date of schools, we used as parameter of social distance the technological information system for tracking urban mobility by apps of INLOCO. This index exists to assist authorities in targeting public security, communication and health resources and shows the percentage of the population that is respecting the isolation recommendation. [8] To evaluate the effect of social distancing strategy on the incidence of AB, the absolute reduction (without social distancing -with social distancing) and relative reduction (without social distancing -with social distancing / without social distancing) was calculated by analyzing the subsets 2016vs2020, 2017vs2020, 2018vs2020 and 2019vs2020. For this analysis, the months of March to June were used because March is the period of implementation of the social distancing strategy in Brazil in the year of 2020, including the law to determine the closing of schools and daycare centers for infants.[9] Data analysis has been truncated at the end of June for the purpose of this article since there is a delay in data entry.To calculate the difference in incidence rates between the without and with social distancing periods, incidence rate ratio (IRR) was used to assess statistical significance, considering a 95% confidence interval (CI). This data analysis methodology is already well documented in the literature. [10] [11] [12] To ensure quality, two independent authors reviewed all data. This study does not contain personal or individual data, so it was considered exempt from evaluation by the Research Ethics Committee. Table 1 .To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the impact of social distancing interventions in reducing hospitalizations due to AB in Brazil, using a temporal trend analysis. Also noteworthy is the fact that interventions to control the COVID-19 pandemic in schools (extended to daycare centers) [13] were implemented by Educational Ministry of Brazil at March 17, few days before the beginning of autumn season on southern hemisphere, a period of historical significant increases in hospitalizations for bronchiolitis. In addition, probably no other country in the Southern hemisphere has such robust national and regional epidemiological data, considering the population size, the viral seasonality and the higher incidence than in developed contries. [14] Our results show a annual increase in the incidence of hospitalizations for AB in the past few years, similar to studies carried out in developing countries. [2] Since 2016, the peak of A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 8 incidence begins in March and April, and goes on until July. In 2020, however, there was an abrupt decline in the monthly incidence of hospitalization due to AB that coincides with the implementation of the social distancing measures. Our analysis of the DATASUS dataset detected a reduction of more than 70% in hospital admissions coded for AB in infants younger than one year in all regions of the country and the April-June incidence of AB admissions in 2020 was the lowest for the past 5 years.Even when annual and geographical variations [15, 16] of the epidemic. [21] [22] [23] Our data suggest that the measures applied to the control of COVID-19 also have a critical impact on the spread of AB.The impact of each preventive action is very difficult to acsses. Social distancing was accompanied by many measures, as the widespread use of masks, [24] recommendations for hand washing and the use of gel alcohol before and after contact with other people and inanimate objects, which are in line with guidelines to controlling the transmission of infection by RSV and other etiologic agents related to AB, at the population level. [25] Some other behavioral changes in a pandemic context may also influence our results, such as avoidance of looking for health care in a hospital or clinic. Nonetheless, it could be an reason for reduction only in mild AB episodes and our study addresses only AB requiring hospitalization, sometimes with serious signs and symptoms. [26] As the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 interaction with others respiratory viruses is not fully understood, other factors as an decreased susceptibility to other viruses due to the colonization of the nasopharynx for SARS-CoV-2 could be an issue. However, as respiratory coinfection or codetection rates with SARS-CoV-2 up to 26.1% are reported, this rationale does not explain our findings completely. [27] Further, it could be questioned why the social distancing had a higher impact in reducing transmission of RSV and other AB-related viruses than in SARS-CoV-2, considering that the basic reproductive number (R0) of RSV, which is the most frequent cause of bronchiolitis, is around 3.0, [28, 29] and the R0 estimated of SARS-CoV-2 between 2.0 to 3.5. [30] However, the actual of SARS-CoV-2 R0 could be higher (5.7 (95% CI 3.8-8.9) [31] which could explain impact of social distancing in the incidence of AB compared to COVID-19, as respiratory viruses share similar routes of transmission.Conducting a retrospective study has some limitations, especially in the context of a pandemic. The biggest one refers to the fact that we use a database that is filled by third parties. To minimize this impact and ensure that the data is treated reliably, we captured data after two months of the month of hospitalization. According to our previous experiences, [10- A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 10 12] this period is sufficient for the base to present the final numbers or very approximate values, since the data are included based on the Hospitalization Authorizations forms, in Brazil AIH (hospital admission authorization).In addition, we used ICDP96 -other conditions originating in the perinatal period, as comparison.In summary, the incidence of hospitalizations related to AB was importantly reduced after the implementation of the social distancing measures. To our knowledge, such epidemiology changes in AB-related hospitalizations during South hemisphere autumn-winter season in Brazil have not been previously reported. .

488d2b61c1b387ad32a7ca3baa9112a0d0a6cd32,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Nutritional Status: The Missing Link?,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has rapidly spread across the globe, and as of 1st June 2020, 6 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, including >371,000 deaths (1) .Age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, immunosuppression, and organ failure are risk factors related to illness severity (2) . SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a broad clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic to the development of serious pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Data from 72,314 patients with show that the prevalences of mild, severe, and critical cases were found to be 81%, 14%, and 5%, respectively (2) . Fever, cough, fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, and pneumonia are the most common manifestations of COVID-19, and may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, metabolic acidosis, septic shock, coagulation dysfunction, and organ failure, including liver, kidney, and heart (3) (4) (5) (6) .COVID-19 patients usually present lymphocytopenia upon admission, and thrombocytopenia and leukopenia are frequent among those with serious illness (7) . Furthermore, augmented concentrations of C-reactive protein and proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, were also associated with severity (7, 8) . The body's first reaction against viral infection is the triggering of rapid and synchronized innate immune responses. However, an excessive reaction may cause damage to human tissues (9, 10) . It is postulated that hyperinflammatory aggression of the lungs, induced by disproportionate immune activation and coagulopathy, may be involved in disease progression and aggravation.Nutritional status and diet modulate inflammation and immune function and may be adjusted to impact COVID-19 outcome. Herein, we will discuss the current available evidence concerning the role of nutritional status in COVID-19 patients, as well as the potential relevance of nutritional readjustment in the prevention and management of infection. dendritic cells, and macrophages (35, 36). One such immune dysfunction results in a dampened immune response to infections (37-39).Remarkably increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection are considered to be among the most important causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple-organ failure (40). A balanced pro-and anti-inflammatory response is crucial for body homeostasis (41, 42). The loss or impaired function of one of the regulatory components can favor the ""cytokine storm"" phenomenon in tissues with exacerbated proinflammatory response, such as the lung and adipose tissue (43) . As recently proposed by Ryan and Caplice (44) , unbalanced local inflammation is associated with overreaction to viral spread, entry, and viral shedding, leading to amplification and maintenance of the immune response (44) . The impaired inflammatory response contributes to the severity of lung lesions found in patients with influenza (45) , and may play a key role in COVID-19 progression. We put forward the hypothesis that white adipose tissue acts as a relevant player in the disease, since SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed not only in the lung and heart, kidney, liver, and blood vessels, but also abundantly in the white adipose tissue (46, 47) , An additional interesting aspect is that there is adipose anatomical site-associated heterogeneity in the expression of ACE2, which is higher in the visceral depots (48) . The enlarged visceral adipose pads in obese patients have been suggested to possibly act as reservoir for viruses, thereby increasing total virus load as a result of an ""explosive systemic response of the angiotensin II and angiotensin II type 1 receptor axis"" promoted by the tissue, and not perceived by the clinicians, who generally do not envisage white adipose tissue as a vital organ (47) .Obese individuals present additionally, a delayed capacity of IFN production, which allows higher viral RNA replication, consequently increasing the opportunity of the emergence of novel, more virulent viral strains (38, 49) . Obesity is also associated with epithelial dysfunction and increased permeability, which could permit rapid virus shedding from the tissue and, consequently, faster spreading (50) . Based on these data, it is possible to infer that obesity could have a potential role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (51). In patients with influenza, obesity was related to virus shedding for an extended time (up to 104% longer) than that observed in lean individuals (52) , whereas BMI was positively correlated with virus content in exhaled breath (53) . Thus, apart from their increased susceptibility to infection, obese individuals could have a role in the augmentation of virus pathogenicity and transmission. Since 52% of the world's population are now obese or overweight (54), practical implications, such as a longer quarantine for obese people, should be considered (45) .It is also important to highlight that obese people may not benefit from a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to the same extent as healthy-weight individuals. An association between higher BMI and a greater decline in influenza antibody titers 1-y post vaccination (55) , as well as lower concentrations of vaccine-induced H1N1-specific antibodies in obese mice (56) , were reported. Additionally, vaccinated obese individuals show double the risk of developing influenza (and influenza-like illness) compared with normal weight individuals (57) . If the same is observed in COVID-19 patients, vaccination may not be an effective method for ensuring protection of the overweight population.Anthropometric (i.e., BMI, waist and hip circumferences) and metabolic parameters (i.e., plasma glucose and insulin) have been used to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 complications (58) . Assessment of insulin resistance, a robust indicator of altered metabolic health, impaired cardiovascular function, and cardiovascular disease-related mortality, is recommended (59) both in primary care, as well as in the evaluation of the potential risk and prognosis in patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result.It is worth noting that obese patients are at higher risk of the development of comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (60) . These comorbidities are increasingly associated with disease progression and poor COVID-19 outcome (61). In a meta-analysis with data from 76,993 patients, the prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 was ∼16%, 12%, and 7%, respectively (62) . The incidence of comorbidities was also determined in a meta-analysis of 6 studies: diabetes, hypertension, and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases were found to be 2-to 3-fold more prevalent in ICU/critical patients than in noncritical cases. These results highlight the susceptibility for worsened outcome among individuals with obesity-related comorbidities (63) . In addition to increased propensity and worsened outcome in patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic disease, COVID-19 infection can, per se, induce cardiovascular complications, including heart failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis, and cardiac arrhythmias (64, 65) . Diabetic individuals show an increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, especially influenza and pneumonia (65) (66) (67) , and experience the disease with greater severity when infected with respiratory viruses (68) (69) (70) .At present, the reason why individuals with obesityrelated comorbidities are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection is unrecognized; however, it may be associated with the ACE2 expression in adipose pads and adipose tissue capacity to induce systemic inflammation. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type I receptor blockers increase considerably the expression of ACE2, and these drugs are very commonly used for the treatment of patients with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (71, 72) . Thus, the higher ACE2 content could help internalization of the virus by cells, thereby increasing the severity of COVID-19 (73) .Serum concentrations of inflammation-related biomarkers are also considerably higher in patients with diabetes (74) . Thus, such patients, when infected, may be at higher risk of developing the ""cytokine storm,"" and consequently of worsened prognosis. In type 2 diabetes there is an imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis, leading to increased concentration of clotting factors and relative inhibition of the fibrinolytic system. Additionally, endothelial dysfunction with enhanced platelet aggregation and activation is observed in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, favoring the emergence of a hypercoagulable prothrombotic state (75) .Distancing measures aimed at the reduction of social interaction have been adopted in several countries as a measure to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection (76) . Given the potential risk of developing severe COVID-19, individuals with comorbidities should firmly adhere to protective measures. To decrease the risk of infection and severe disease, diabetic individuals should maintain strict glycemic control. Inadequate glycemic control is associated with several infections, such as pneumonia, endocarditis, and tuberculosis (77) . Frequent monitoring of glycemia is even more important for obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, since medication adjustment to maintain blood glucose concentrations may be necessary to adapt to the new caloric requirements of reduced physical activity and energy intake imposed by quarantines (78) . In addition, diabetic patients with heart disease or kidney disease may require specific care to stabilize cardiac/renal status (77) .Undernutrition, a pathologic state in which dietary intake fails to meet the body's energy or nutritional requirements, can arise from inadequate intake of macronutrients or micronutrients, abnormally increased energy expenditure, defective absorption of nutrients, or any combination of these (79) . Worldwide, there were an estimated 821 million undernourished individuals in 2017 (80), a condition widely prevalent in developing countries (81) . Protein-energy malnutrition, as well as deficiencies in specific single nutrients, are largely related to increased risk of mainly occuring infectious diseases (82) (83) (84) (85) .Immune cells show high energy expenditure (86) , and energetic and nutritional demand is increased during periods of infection. For example, basal metabolic rate is significantly higher during a fever due to the activation of the immune response (87) . Because immune cells have no substantial reserve of nutrients, glucose and amino acid uptake is required for immune system activation (88) . Indeed, malnutrition induces a reduction in immune cell number, especially of T cells (81, 85, 89, 90) . For instance, lower CD4 + and CD8 + Tcell numbers have been described in malnourished children (91) . Moreover, malnutrition induces atrophy of primary lymphoid organs, reducing T-and B-cell numbers, leading to leukopenia (92) . This reduced number of immune cells contributes to the impairment of the immune response in malnutrition (93) .Both under-and overnutrition have a great impact on adipose tissue mass, modulating the factors secreted by this tissue, such as hormones and cytokines. During starvation, the activation of immune cells is limited by adipokine signaling, which reduces nutrient consumption, and consequently, the body becomes more susceptible to infection (94) . Leptin plays a pivotal role in reporting nutritional status to immune cells by increasing glucose metabolism in T cells (93) . Leptin concentrations are inversely modified in both extremes of body weight, being reduced in malnourished and increased in obese individuals. Experimental studies show that leptin receptor-deficient mice, as well as malnourished animals, present reduced viral clearance, diminished lung IFN-γ concentration, and lower survival during influenza-A pneumonia infection (95) . It is known that body adiposity is extremely affected by protein-energy malnutrition, leading to reduced systemic leptin concentrations (96) . Therefore, the impaired immune response in malnutrition may be related to poor nutrient intake and dysfunction in leptin signaling, critical factors for the activity and proliferation of immune cells (93) . These findings suggest a crucial role of adipose tissue in the maintenance of immune defense in viral infections.As described previously for obesity, undernutrition may also impact viral replication and pathogenicity. Increased oxidative stress in animal models was associated with virulence and incidence of reproducible genome mutations observed for coxsackievirus and influenza (97) . Since this phenomenon was described for 2 distinct viral RNA families, it is possible to infer that malnutrition may affect the outcome of other virus-induced diseases (97) .ACE2, the receptor crucial to the SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells, is widely expressed in gastrointestinal cells, such as those of the intestinal epithelium. Therefore, the digestive system may also be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to gastrointestinal disorders and impairment of the nutritional status of patients (98) . Indeed, anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and mild abdominal pain were reported in COVID-19 patients (7) . Anorexia is the most common among the digestive system-related symptoms, and it could be related to inflammation, hypoxia, dysregulated hepatic function, or represent the side effects of therapeutic drugs. Diarrhea is yet another common gastrointestinal symptom, affecting ∼2% to 50% of patients (99) . The particular mechanism related to the pathogenesis of diarrhea in patients with COVID-19 is not fully elucidated; however, some possible causes are described: direct aggression to the digestive epithelium by the virus, side effects of antiviral drugs, or dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota induced by antibiotics (99) . Anorexia along with diarrhea could contribute to nutritional imbalance, and consequently to a delay in recovery (100, 101) . Moreover, patients with COVID-19 and digestive symptoms were more prone to complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome (7) . Clearly, the gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 may be even more harmful in malnourished patients. This aspect could be of even more importance for the elderly, since a reduction in mobility along with a depletion of muscle mass and poor nutrient intake are frequently present in older adults (102) .Elderly persons are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and experience a poorer outcome when compared with younger patients (7, 103, 104) . Aging is associated with alterations in both the innate and the adaptive immune response, a process known as immunosenescence (105) . Hematopoietic tissue (106, 107) , lymphocyte number (108), proliferative and functional capacity of effector lymphocytes (107) , and activity of NK cells (109) are all reduced in the elderly. These alterations induce a basal systemic inflammatory state, or ""inflammaging"" (110) , and are associated with an augmented susceptibility to viral infection (111) . High morbidity and mortality are observed in elderly patients with infections, especially those of the respiratory tract (112) (113) (114) . This situation could be prevented through vaccination; however, vaccine efficacy in this population is greatly reduced in comparison to that in younger adults (115) (116) (117) (118) (119) . Immunosenescence-related alterations, such as reduced concentrations of naive T and B cells, decreased B-cell diversity, and impaired antibody response to new antigens, result in diminished response to vaccination or new infection (108, 120, 121) .Nutritional deficiencies of micro-and/or macronutrients are frequent in older adults, as stated (122) . Although there are few data regarding malnutrition in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, given the prevalence of severe disease among elderly patients it is likely that a significant proportion of these patients were undernourished at the time of hospitalization (123) . In agreement with this hypothesis, the risk of malnutrition and malnutrition in individuals >65 y of age was 27.5% and 52.7%, respectively, in a cross-sectional study in patients with COVID-19 (124) . Many reasons may be related to the higher prevalence of compromised nutritional status in older patients with COVID-19. First, a catabolic state induced by the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection may induce skeletal muscle wasting. The concentrations of proinflammatory markers, such as Creactive protein, TNF-ɑ, and ferritin are usually augmented in these patients (125) , and the utilization of albumin and even muscle protein may be needed to synthesize the acute-phase proteins (125) . This is consistent with the hypoalbuminemia and low calf circumference observed in these patients (126, 127) . Second, in addition to respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported as being most prevalent in elderly patients with COVID-19 (7). Thus, digestive tract malfunction can exacerbate the poor nutritional status in older patients with COVID-19. Last, immunosenescence per se may contribute to potentialize all alterations in COVID-19 (128) .Sarcopenia is defined by impaired muscle strength, reduced muscle quantity/quality, and poor physical performance (129) . The pathogenesis of sarcopenia is associated with proinflammatory cytokines (130, 131) , and muscle mass and strength are inversely proportional to IL-6 and TNFɑ plasma concentrations in healthy older individuals (131) . Loss of muscle mass and function is a usual condition in the elderly, as well as in younger individuals with acute and chronic muscle-wasting diseases, such as cancer, chronic heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and chronic infection (132) . Studies have described that sarcopenia is a predictor of the risk of pneumonia in the elderly (132) , and it is associated with mechanical ventilation, hospitalization time, and mortality in ICU patients (130, (132) (133) (134) .Sarcopenia may affect normal weight healthy and overweight/obese individuals, being different from weight loss or cachexia (135) (136) (137) . Augmented fat mass associated with low muscle mass or high fat mass together with low muscle strength are known as sarcopenic obesity (138) . Ectopic fat accumulation in skeletal muscle and other tissues is a characteristic of obesity (139) . The increased fat content leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and induces the production of reactive oxygen species (134) . This microenvironment is related to enhanced secretion of proinflammatory myokines capable of inducing muscle dysfunction (134) . In turn, adipose tissue inflammation may be exacerbated by these proinflammatory myokines, supporting the condition of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation. This sets up a vicious cycle supporting inflammation of both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, hence stimulating and maintaining sarcopenic obesity (134) . As obesity has been related to a poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19, it cannot be discarded that sarcopenic obesity is an even more harmful scenario (133) .The sarcopenic phenotype is also associated with decreased physical activity (129) . This is extremely relevant in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic, since many people are staying at home and are currently physically inactive (spending a long time sitting or lying down). Prolonged immobility is associated with muscle mass wasting within the first week of bed rest, which is even worse in individuals with the severe form of the disease (140) . The duration of hospital stay of COVID-19 patients is, on average, between 11 and 15 d (141); thus, patients may be prone to developing sarcopenia.Bearing in mind that sarcopenia may play a relevant role in COVID-19 outcome, Krznaric and colleagues (142) recently proposed the utilization of 2 clinical tools to assess nutritional risk and loss of muscle mass and function remotely by incorporating them into telemedicine processes and digital platforms. For a simple, preliminary diagnosis of sarcopenia, the Strength, Assistance with walking, Rise from a chair, Climb stairs and Falls (SARC-F) questionnaire, which evaluates muscle strength, assistance with walking, rise from a chair, climbing stairs, and falls, may be adopted (143) . The prescription of personalized nutrition care and support is recommended for patients whose questionnaire results are predictive of sarcopenia and poor outcome (142, 144, 145) .The COVID-19 outbreak has brought a great challenge for all communities and health care systems worldwide. Considering the absence of specific therapeutic treatment and of an effective vaccine, countries are taking strong measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, ranging from increasing social distancing to community-wide quarantine. Changes in dietary habits and lifestyle parameters, due to quarantine and social isolation, may lead to an impaired nutritional status. Obesity and related comorbidities are associated with physiological alterations leading to higher susceptibility to infection and pathogenicity and transmission of COVID-19 (Figure 1) . Moreover, with no imminent end to the pandemic , people should be encouraged to improve their lifestyle to lessen the risks both in the current and likely subsequent waves of COVID-19. Healthy habits are important not only to ensure optimal immune response but also to prevent and/or treat undernutrition, obesity, and obesity-related comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, clear advice on the impact of the nutritional status in COVID-19 outcomes should be provided to alert the population. Finally, it should be emphasized that nutritional status must be considered also in health policies designed to diminish the impact of COVID-19. ",Brazil,first author,2020-09-25,9
89c56cccf9503c50f99f5b8cac6e688f35d52f61,Public Health Nutrition: page 1 of 5,"The COVID-19 pandemic raises important issues related to food and food security and living conditions in different countries. Poverty and food insecurity (FI) affect people in all regions of the world to different extents according to the availability of and access to tools that guarantee the survival of the population. The relationship between inequality and health is a field that has always been present in the daily life of marginalised populations around the world, even before the occurrence of the COVID-19. However, with the occurrence of the pandemic, an expressive portion of the population has been plunged into a state of extreme poverty, a result of the interaction between a history of structural, social and economic inequality and the expressive contingent of informal or unemployed workers, enhanced by the precarious conditions of the food production and commercialisation system, which involves agribusiness, a complex system of economic interests of large global groups (1, 2) . These conditions are intensified by the impact of the fight for land, restricted access to drinking water and natural disasters with effects on the climate and the scarcity or lack of rain in many geographical regions of the planet (3) .Within these contexts, the inadequacy of the infrastructure of society is associated with that of the life conditions of families, such as unemployment and little power to purchase goods needed for survival, including food, the lack of access to which increases in times of pandemic, plunging a large number of adults, children and the elderly around the world into poverty and FI (4) .As a result of the pandemic, around 49 million people on the planet have entered into poverty conditions in 2020 (5) . Also, the most recent estimates indicate that by the end of this year, 820 million people will suffer from hunger globally (6) and more than 130 million people in the world may enter into the category of extreme hunger (7) .Within this context, we will discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic may increase poverty and FI and the outlook for facing these problems, ensuring the discussion of the social, economic and political rights of the population.Several public health questions must be currently addressed: How does FI affect the occurrence of COVID-19? What strategies can countries implement to prevent or minimise the worsening of poverty and FI during the COVID-19 pandemic?The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to result in even more food shortages in the world, affecting mostly underdeveloped countries. All of this is further exacerbated by recurring phenomena such as floods and droughts and by the practice of a cruel market logic, where there is an incentive to raise food prices (4, 8) .FI and poverty may increase dramatically in socially vulnerable populations with the expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic because it has affected income in many countries. Increased poverty and FI is expected due to the complexity of generating income in more vulnerable segments of the population, such as among informal workers, as well as the dismissal of employees from work (4, 8) .The reduction in the availability of food must also be considered, especially due to ruptures in the production and commercialisation chains of family agriculture in the local environment, which contributes to the onset and/or exacerbation of FI (4, (8) (9) (10) . The closure of points of sale and commercialisation of food, for example, open markets and low-budget restaurants (11) , and limitations on the production of food and transportation for agricultural products may constitute disturbances for those populations that depend on local production and commercialisation and/ or imports of food for family and community consumption, as well as the obtainment of income to satisfy other basic needs. Food production may also be affected by a lack of labour due to social distancing and restricted movement, as well as restrictions on imports, which could contribute to increasing FI during and after COVID-19.People living in slums or on the streets, those deprived of freedom, as well as sex workers and people living with HIV/ AIDS and other chronic diseases, are more vulnerable to FI due to biological issues or unfavourable social and economic conditions (12) (13) (14) . Hence, for all these groups, the risk of poverty and FI makes COVID-19 infection severe and real.Malnutrition and moderate and severe FI can decrease the body's immune system capacity (15) . In such cases, the possibility of severe complications or high mortality would increase in these groups due to infection by COVID-19. Moreover, poor immunological and virological responses may be associated with an increased risk of infectious disease transmission (16) .From a biological, economic and social perspective, these groups may be undernourished and face nutritional deficiencies such as anaemia and deficiencies in vitamins A and D and antioxidant minerals (e.g. Fe, Zn and Se), which may be due to the chronic deficiencies in food consumption or impaired physiological use of nutrients (17) (18) (19) .The worsening of poverty and food and nutritional insecurity of a population in the pandemic context may be intensified according to the pre-existing social determinants of health, the repercussions of social policies and living conditions in the community and individual environment of indigenous, quilombola, black and LGBTQIþ populations, especially in poor countries where the pandemic lays bare the more perverse side of the health crisis. Within this context, it is noted that racism and discrimination, precarious socioeconomic conditions and the presence of chronic diseases and previous infections can increase FI and influence COVID-19 severity (Fig. 1) .From a social protection perspective, overcoming hunger may be a challenge for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income countries. This is because people with FI may not adhere to health-protection strategies and may have difficulty following recommendations related to social isolation and hygiene. Moreover, these people may come from families where the head is unemployed or they may be informal workers living in slum agglomerations and improvised housing, sometimes with a single room and precarious personal hygiene equipment that is sometimes shared (1) . In addition, individuals need to work to acquire financial resources to buy food and other supplies needed for survival and are exposed to the risk of contact with the pandemic virus. Adequate social space and living conditions are challenges to be overcome in treating and preventing the occurrence of new cases of COVID-19.Interventions in the social and economic field to overcome hunger and mitigate the impact of poverty can be a challenge for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income countries. Successful experiences in this field allow populations living in poverty and FI to overcome the social difficulties by following recommendations related to social isolation, considering the need to seek financial resources and work to buy food. Such interventions can be considered a priority in treating and preventing new cases of COVID-19.The interventions for fighting poverty and FI have been carried out in a weak and heterogeneous way in poor countries, not achieving the resolution of social inequality, even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in the face of the pandemic, the social movements have intensified and pressured the state to adopt economic benefit policies, particularly involving income transfers and social protection. Nonetheless, the state continues to adopt these policies as a 'gift' and not for intervening in social protection and taking responsibility for guaranteeing sustained access to adequate food and healthcare, which ensure social and economic protection and thus human dignity.It is worth noting that countries with high COVID-19 mortality, such as Brazil, have seen little participation or an absence of the state in formulating policies for preventing and controlling the disease 20 , intensifying the burden of COVID-19 on populations in a context of poverty and food and nutritional security.Incentives for the production and distribution of food to socially and economically vulnerable groups have been adopted in different countries with a view to providing food security. Financing and donations of resources to farmers' cooperatives and small and medium businesses are being adopted to expand and improve their operations to meet the needs of local communities during the pandemic. Countries and states with policies of blocking borders and roads must enable access to urban and rural spaces with the aim of promoting the sustainability of food production and distribution.Production and commercialisation at a national and local level must take into consideration the need to monitor food production chains and agricultural products. These strategies could be combined with tracing and monitoring job and income losses, which can negatively affect the ability of social groups to buy food and to guarantee that the food systems continue to function during the pandemic (11) .Also noteworthy is the donation and distribution of personal protection equipment and disinfectants to teams at community kitchens and restaurants distributing food, with the aim of protecting workers from COVID-19 and continuing the distribution of food (11) .Also observed are policies that aim to guarantee food access and financial transfers to people in contexts of vulnerability, as well as the adaptation of school food programmes, with the distribution of food/food kits and meals to students and their families. Data on food prices and stocks have also been monitored, especially in the main urban consumption centres affected by COVID-19, planning suitable actions for social, food and nutritional protection and an emergency response to increase in food prices (11) .These strategies are important for mitigating social inequalities, but it is important to highlight that multibillionaires and groups with high economic power are using the pandemic as an opportunity to earn exorbitant profits with products and services (20, 21) . Instead of allowing multibillionaires to become much richer, governments need to defend working families. Thus, it is suggested that states should tax the enormous gains that billionaires have obtained during the pandemic and use that money to guarantee healthcare and food for people and families in contexts of poverty (20) . Hence, it is understood that the state should assume the political, social and economic responsibility given to it, at all levels of management (municipal, state and federal).Intervention strategies to reduce vulnerability to poverty and hunger are a duty of the state and are needed at a global level, especially in low-and middle-income countries. The COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation reduce production and food access. Therefore, strategic food storage policies at local/municipal levels should be considered to enable equitable food distribution in times of scarcity and to avoid hunger. Another possibility would be the cooperative distribution of surplus food to countries with lower agricultural production and high FI.It is also recommended that new evidence be sought on the relationship between social vulnerability and the COVID-19 infection. In addition to strengthening existing income-transfer policies in countries, the development of food and nutrition insecurity policies and the distribution of financial resources to socially vulnerable people should be encouraged, despite the global economic crisis. In this pandemic phase, political solidarity and commitment to social welfare are expected to reduce inequalities and to guarantee the human right to adequate food and life.",Brazil,first author,2020-09-08,9
ab93ae059abdcd0186a92f8b3758290fa2d218df,Qualitative analysis of the coordination of major system change within the Colombian health system in response to COVID-19: study protocol,"Coronavirus (COVID-19) is posing a major and unprecedented challenge to health service planning and delivery across health systems internationally [1] . Early evidence from Asian economies (Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan) coping with COVID-19 suggests that 'integration of services in the health system and across other sectors amplifies the ability to absorb and adapt to shock' [2] . However, local evidence is needed from other health systems internationally in order to examine the relevance of this hypothesis and to implement this and other organizational lessons for responding to . Specific organizational problems need to be addressed to improve service integration at the operational and governance levels. These include developing the capacity, safety and quality of services to respond to demand from critically ill and other types of patient affected by COVID-19, directly or indirectly (service level), and coordinating a variety of individual health service organizations, municipalities and other stakeholders in the adaptive planning of services locally and nationally (governance level).Colombia, an upper-middle-income country in Latin America, faces particular challenges in coordinating its response to system-wide problems like COVID-19. These relate to the antecedent conditions of the health system at the time of experiencing the pandemic. Although recent regulatory developments in Colombia promote the strengthening of leadership for population health and system change [3] [4] [5] , and the need for multidisciplinary and multi-sectoral care is recognized (Law 1438/2011), there remains a lack of system leadership and coordination [6] . Thus, enabling integration processes to create the 'adaptive capacity' [2] of suggested importance to Asian countries' response to COVID-19 may be particularly challenging and will require active intervention and learning processes.This study will examine the response of Colombia's health system to COVID-19, both nationally and through local case studies, and provide timely, formative feedback to policymakers and health service leaders to inform health system planning. To generate such evidence, the study employs a multi-level, qualitative investigation of the national response of Colombia's health system to COVID-19 and includes in-depth case studies of three major cities in Colombia-and governance relationships with the wider departments (states) in which they are situated-in order to trace local variation in responses. The study's findings will be useful for health professionals responsible for leading health service delivery as well as those actors leading the formulation and implementation of public health policies.The changes required by health systems to address the challenges posed by COVID-19 will be analysed using a social science concept, 'major system change' (MSC), that has been used to examine other forms of servicewide change (e.g. stroke service centralization) [7, 8] . MSC in health care involves coordinated change across multiple organizations, including providers and purchasers of services, across a metropolitan area or region with the aim of improving services across an entire geographical area [9] . There is an emerging literature on barriers and enablers of change involving multiple organizations, some of which have been distilled into a framework of 'simple rules' for guiding improvement work [7, 9] . These include involving stakeholders inside and outside the health service, including patients and communities, combining top-down and bottom-up leadership, creating feedback loops and learning from history or past experiences.However, little is known about how navigating major system change is influenced by a context of 'crisis' decision-making, characterized by time pressure, complexity and uncertainty [10], as well as potential challenges with making sense of the fluidity of the evidence base for, and resources dependencies within health systems to, implement change in the time of COVID-19. This study will take account of how evidence informs decision-making on MSC during a time of 'crisis', including the availability, type and sources of evidence used; the nature of stakeholder involvement; and the ways in which such evidence is incorporated into health system planning [11] relative to examples of MSC with longer-term planning.The project will address the following research question: 'which organizational processes are enabling andThis study will explore the relevance of the concept of major system change, or coordinated improvements involving multiple stakeholders, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia.Major system change has been applied to the study of longer-term planning of service change, but little is known about its relevance in a context of 'crisis' decision-making on, and fluidity of the evidence for, implementing change in the time of COVID-19. This research question will be answered by meeting the following objectives:1. To characterize, from the experiences of key actors of the health system at the national and local level, the strategies and organizational resources (including human resources and infrastructure) used to respond to the COVID-19 by each of the local health systems chosen for the study.2. To identify critical coordination issues or 'bottlenecks' that are constraining the capacity of the selected local health systems to respond to the pandemic as well as factors that facilitate the response.and practices of coordination between actors that promote responsiveness to COVID-19 and have potential for scaling up more widely across health systems and/or integrated into healthcare guidelines or protocols.4. To establish mechanisms for sharing lessons and experiences of the crisis in a timely fashion with health system leaders and other key stakeholders to inform health service planning in relation to COVID-19 and future pandemics of national and international origin.The methods that will be used for generating evidence in relation to these objectives are outlined below.The study design will be informed by social science theory and research methods and adopt a qualitative, case study design [12] . Conceptually, the research will be informed by the theoretical frameworks of the social sciences that explore health services, and their integration, as 'systems' [13] , MSC in health systems [7, 9] and care and management in relation to health emergencies [14, 15] . The study will be qualitative in order to give special attention to the narratives and the experience of the actors who have been directly involved in responding to the pandemic, at multiple levels of Colombia's health system. The evidence developed will be drawn from stakeholder scoping discussions or interviews, analysis of secondary data sources and in-depth qualitative case studies of how three Colombian cities, including their departmental relationships, are responding to COVID-19. A qualitative approach was chosen due to, first, the exploratory or scoping nature of this study (i.e. the key priorities and research themes facing the health system in response to COVID-19 will be uncovered as data is collected) and, second, because of the need to gain the views and experiences of a range of stakeholders that can be uncovered most effectively through open-ended conversation or dialogue [16] .The study design involves two main phases and will establish mechanisms for providing timely, formative feedback to health system stakeholders ( Fig. 1 ).The aim of this rapid, initial phase is to acquire and share immediate challenges and opportunities for improvement in response to COVID-19 that can be shared in a timely way with health service leaders to inform immediate health service planning. This phase will focus on national level actors in Colombia, and the response of the health system to the pandemic in Bogotá, Colombia's capital city. Bogotá, Colombia's largest city with a population of 7.4 million, was chosen because it hosts all of the national governmental bodies that design the guidelines to respond to COVID-19 including the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation and the National Institute of Health. Bogotá also centralizes many of the universities and national scientific associations and committees that are assessing the national response to the emergency. In addition, Bogotá was chosen given that it is the city that concentrates the highest number of patients positive for COVID-19 in the country (to 1 July 2020, Bogotá had 30,017 or 31% of the 97,846 cases across the country); this has been the trend since the emergency was declared in the country early in March 2020 [17] . Up to thirty scoping discussions will be conducted virtually in relation to Bogota either by telephone or using online applications (e.g. Microsoft Teams). The stakeholders will be selected in order to sample a range of planning, provider and intermediary organizations engaged in responding to COVID-19.Using the research priorities and themes identified in phase 1 of the study, a deeper set of qualitative case studies of three health systems' responses to COVID-19 in Colombia will be undertaken. This will cover the metropolitan area of Bogotá, developing the interview data acquired in phase 1, and two other local health systems within Colombia in order to compare and contrast health service needs and responses across different geographical territories of the country.Ongoing: identifying mechanisms for providing timely and formative feedbackThe research will include, from the outset, investigation of the optimal mechanisms for the communication of emerging findings from the research study to maximize their impact on policy and practice in relation to COVID-19, as achieving impact is recognized as the driving purpose of the study. During the initial scoping discussions with stakeholders, their preferences for sharing feedback from the study (both content and approach) will be ascertained and collated. Thus, we will seek to share findings in a timely way, and as widely as possible with stakeholders and planners of local health systems, and nationally, in order to maximize their potential impact. This consultative approach will draw on and develop approaches used in previous research [18, 19] and principles of knowledge mobilization concerning the tailoring of findings to stakeholder audiences [20] .The stakeholders in phase 1 of the study will be limited to national-level interviewees and those relating to Bogotá's health system in order to provide coherence across the interviews (i.e. all participants will be referring to a common health system across a metropolitan area) and to support the acquisition of contacts to interview across the metropolitan area (i.e. convenience and snowball sampling). Organizations, and potential interviewees within them, will be selected on the basis of those who have first-hand awareness of the situation facing the health system, nationally and in the three localities. This includes relevant actors in terms of health service providers, as well as key entities in the design of guidelines and planning of actions in public health. Once this network is identified, we will prioritize the most relevant organizations in responding to COVID-19 through stakeholder analysis. In these selected cases, we will carry out interviews with key actors within each organization who can give us a general and comprehensive vision of the way in which, from their specific role, they have responded to the emergency (for example, representatives of the local health secretary, hospital/ clinic managers, leaders of scientific committees, representatives of the risk management unit). We understand that access to these spaces in current circumstances represents a challenge and, for this reason, during the first phase of our project we will be in contact with key bodies nationally and locally that have links to the relevant communities of practice (e.g. Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Ministry of Health and Social Protection and the National Institute of Health). The aim is to work closely with these entities and seek their support in negotiating access issues by providing official letters supporting the project, making suggestions of key organizations to be contacted and providing contact details of individuals in the organizations. Potential interviewees will be also be identified through informal discussion with colleagues in the School of Management, and other faculties including Government and Medicine, which have links to the relevant communities of practice within the health services and local government, including hospitals linked to the medical school.While recent interest in the theory and practice of MSC has grown [7] [8] [9] [21] [22] [23] , there is a lack of research on the navigation of MSC within health systems in lowand middle-income countries (LMIC). Little is known about the professional and organizational processes shaping approaches to, and implementation of, change in LMIC in Latin America. Studying coordinated change in the LMIC context is important because such countries are likely to face particular resource pressures and technical constraints, e.g. on public health knowledge [5] . Colombia is an upper-middle-income country, and OECD member, with a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of $6931 [24] . Colombia has a social health insurance model, funded through general taxation and payroll deductible contributions [25] . In 1992, the passing of Law 100 introduced compulsory health insurance for formal sector workers (and their families), while those working in the informal sector or unemployed would be covered by the lower cost 'subsidized insurance scheme'. Patients choose an insurer to purchase services from public or private providers on behalf of their patients. Providers compete to deliver services to insurers who pay for services (so-called managed competition) [25] . Healthcare in Colombia is organized into networks of providers (Law 100/1993; Law 1122/2007), mainly private and some publicly owned, with primary care the entry point and coordinator of patient care. The territorial entities (departments, districts and municipalities) are responsible for public health activities, collective health programmes and health promotion. In relation to the population using the publicly subsidized regime, and the uninsured (4% of the population), the territorial entities contract services from publicly owned healthcare providers (these are social state enterprises). By 2012, the subsidized scheme covered 48.1% of the population [26] . Since 2015, both schemes have provided access to an equal range of services; however, judiciary intervention needed to address barriers to access to services is high [25] . Barriers to access are a particular problem with the subsidized insurance system, as 70% of the total claims made come from this system [27] . The subsidized insurance scheme covers those individuals classified as poor according to a proxy means test (SISBEN); the scheme targets more vulnerable and poorer groups of population in Colombian society.The three in-depth case studies will be purposively sampled using a range of criteria, including COVID-19 prevalence data, urbanity, health system design (e.g. mix of public and private providers) and technical capacity in public health. Data collection will involve remote and face-to-face interviews, documentary evidence and nonparticipant observations where possible (face-to-face aspect dependent on wider travel restrictions across Colombia at the time of phase 2 of the research). The case studies will focus on the planning and operational delivery of the response to COVID-19 in three major cities (Bogota, and two others chosen using the selection criteria above), and their governance relationships with the wider departments (states) in which they are situated and the national health system.The aim of collecting qualitative data is to be build up a rich picture, or thick description [28] , of the roles, responsibilities and relationships of different organizations making up the national and local health systems and, in particular, how the quality of relationships, including capacity constraints or deficits and innovative forms of integration to address capacity issues, are influencing responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.Interviews (up to 30 per case study and up to 90 in total) will be conducted with stakeholders associated with change at different levels, including leaders of change planning at the national and local level, both within the health system and within municipal authorities; senior executives, operational managers and heads of relevant clinical departments, e.g. intensive care units, within provider organizations such as hospitals; other key stakeholders including insurance providers, regulatory authorities, professional associations and network-based organizations; and scientific or 'expert' advisers including official advisory groups.Key themes explored in relation to each case study will include how different professions understand and participate in change processes; organizational processes including orientations toward collaboration with other organizations both within and beyond the health service in responding to COVID-19; factors influencing the capacity of healthcare organizations to respond to the pandemic, including availability of human resources, clinical space and equipment; inter-organizational relationships within the health system and with municipal organizations; their immediate priorities for improving the response to COVID-19 within their own organization and across the health system; and how the regulation and culture of the health system locally and nationally shapes the approach to, and implementation, of MSC in relation to COVID-19. The interviews will also explore the perceived resources that each health system has, including their technical capacity to respond to COVID-19, as well as their public health capacity to implement changes suggested by the study.All study participants will be given an information sheet and provide informed consent. All discussions will be audio-recorded and informed by a topic guide. The topic guide for the interviews is provided (Additional file 1). The interviews will be transcribed in full by a professional transcription company. The researchers employed on the study will have experience undertaking qualitative research in Colombia, and they will be bilingual in Spanish and English to facilitate the production of reports and papers in both languages.The interview data will be supplemented with analysis of documents (e.g. legal, financial and operational planning documents) at local and national level and nonparticipant observations where feasible (e.g. attending planning meetings) relating to the responses to COVID-19 will be conducted.For both phases 1 and 2, the interview transcripts, and other data such as notes of observations, will be analysed thematically using a combination of inductive and deductive coding [29] . Coding will be informed by the empirical data as it relates to the study objectives (inductive analysis) as well as themes in existing research on MSC and decision-making in crisis (deductive). Thematic analysis of data will involve collective and iterative coding by the research team: similar codes will be grouped together into themes, which will be prioritized in relation to addressing the driving research objectives and the potential contribution to existing understanding of the topic. The prioritized themes will be developed further through recursive coding of the transcripts. Any differences in interpretation of the coded data, and resulting themes, will be discussed among the research team and resolved through debate.By virtue of the need to deliver timely findings that can inform policy and practice, this study will be completed intensively over an 8-month period, under the leadership of the principal investigator and five full-time research assistants. The key activities, outputs and time allocation for their completion by study objective are summarized in Table 1 .This study will speak to critical questions concerning the implementation of change under conditions that are far removed from planning 'usual care' and its improvement [30] . It will appraise the relevance of the concept of MSC in a context of 'crisis' decision-making and contribute to international lessons on improving the capacity and capabilities of health systems to respond to COVID-19 and future pandemics. In addition, the study will produce findings that aim to inform the planning of health services nationally and at a local health system level within Colombia on navigating MSC, recognizing the need to adapt, test and refine the theory in the context of a pandemic. To meet this purpose, data collection for this study will include assessing how best to share formative feedback from the research according to stakeholders' preferences, and outputs from the study will include the building of a network with relevant communities of practice, short, accessible summaries of journal papers, and interactive guidance aimed at practitioner and policymaker audiences, the design and communication of which will draw on knowledge mobilization theory and experiences [19, 20] .As this study is being undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic where physical distancing measures are in force, this raises a number of practical issues for its delivery through a virtual team. Firstly, virtual rather than face-to-face meetings among the research team will be necessary to deliver the study objectives. Collaborative software applications, such as Microsoft Teams, that allow videoconferencing and joint project work (e.g. virtual 'brainstorming' via synchronous population of documents) will be used to host team meetings.Secondly, the research team will meet frequently for virtual meetings (e.g. twice per week) in order to set tasks and update on progress. Regular virtual meetings will be used to compensate for the lack of 'informal' alignment mechanisms that might otherwise take place through face-to-face interactions among the team, e.g. having corridor conversations in the management school or taking lunch or coffee together which is common practice on campus and part of the university's established culture.Thirdly, the full research team (the principal investigator and five full-time researchers) will not have met in person at the outset of the project and may not do depending on physical distancing measures, so ensuring a productive and positive working environment in the absence of trust and rapport cultivated through face-toface engagement is a critical issue for the team. To compensate for this, the research team will experiment with a variety of activities to encourage conviviality at a distance, including icebreaking exercises, synchronous epistemic work (e.g. working on shared documents), attending online workshops or lectures together and other virtual social activities (e.g. drinks or food evenings).Fourthly, interview and other forms of data will need to be collected virtually, unless physical distancing measures change during the course of the study. The interviews will be recorded using online software applications (e.g. Skype, Microsoft Teams or Zoom) and, where the interviewee prefers to undertake the interview by telephone, by using mobile phone apps for phone call recording. The conduct of virtual interviews may impact on the quality of the discussion (e.g. this type of communication may lack the opportunities for building rapport and the richness of a face-to-face interaction). However, the study will involve use of video-based interviews, where possible, in order to capture aspects of face-toface interaction (e.g. mutual facial expressions), although the effect may be lessened as these are mediated by screen and the clarity of these will depend on the quality of the particular internet connection.Another practical issue concerns the translation of interview and other qualitative data from Spanish to English, for the purposes of publication in peer-reviewed English and Spanish language journals. Quotes from the interviews and documents in Spanish chosen as relevant for reports and journals will be translated by the research team. Given that the team will be bilingual, researchers will be responsible for guaranteeing the fidelity and linguistic appropriateness of the translation to English.Finally, we recognize that this study is taking place at a very challenging time for the planning and delivery of health services in Colombia and internationally. The study could add to this pressure as participation in the interviews will take up some of the respondents' valuable time. However, the research team will do its best to minimize any inconvenience to participants by arranging to meet at a time suitable for them. Moreover, some participants may feel uncomfortable discussing the response to COVID-19 and its impact on health service planning and the delivery of care. As outlined in the study information sheet and consent form, potential participants will be free to withdraw from the study at any time and are encouraged to discuss any concerns they have before agreeing to take part.

eb34aac02433b05c66533ec29d085fe842aa01ab,Containment to outbreak tipping points in COVID-19,"This saturation of NPIs generates a positive feedback between the number of infected individuals and disease growth rate, which has critical consequences in the disease dynamics, particularly at low numbers. This feedback loop connects the saturation of NPIs with the Allee effect, a central concept in population biology that explains the fate of several populations at low numbers 12, 13 . Indeed, the Allee effect involves a positive feedback between population abundance and population growth rate, which may determine a transition from a negative to a positive growth rate at a given abundance threshold 12, 13 . In disease dynamics, this is interpreted as an epidemic breakpoint, a tipping point below which the outbreak tends to diminish (R e <1), but above which the outbreak grows (R e >1) 8 . However, this phenomenon is not captured in the many variants of SIR and logistic models widely used for the analysis and forecasting of COVID-19 dynamics 2, 3, 6, 7, 19, 23 . Here we aim to fill this gap, formalizing the connection between saturating NPIs and disease dynamics. We show how the saturation of NPIs induce a positive feedback in disease dynamics, from which abrupt transitions in spread rate are expected after a threshold in the number of infected individuals is crossed. Finally, we look for traces of this footprint in actual data from the COVID-19 pandemic.In the absence of contact tracing and quarantine, a randomly chosen infected individual will produce an average number of second infections R e nq (nq: non quarantine). For the sake of clarity in our model we will use quarantine to encapsulate the concepts of 'quarantine' and 'case isolation' without losing explanatory power. This value is determined by the number of social links accumulated in the infectious time (L max ), the probability of disease transmission in each link (b link ), and the probability of having a link with a susceptible individual (P susceptible ) thus R e nq =P susceptible ·b link ·L max (Fig. 1A ).Strong enough NPIs will determine a R e <1 controlling the epidemic 2, [9] [10] [11] . While face mask use, hygienic measures, and physical distancing reduce b link 18 , the number of social links L max can be reduced through contact tracing and subsequent quarantine 10 . Individuals detected by the tracing system are contacted and then put on quarantine. However, only a fraction f q of the infected individuals is detected (D=f q ·I) by the contact tracing, which is determined by the maximum number of cases (K) that can be processed in a day. Moreover, because of the saturation of tracing systems, as the number of infected individuals increases, the fraction f q decreases-here modeled as f q =K/(I 50,D +I), with I 50,D being the number of infected cases at which half the maximum detection is reached 24 .The saturation of the contact tracing system increases the time lag between infection and detection. This is modeled considering that the tracing system can make a fixed number of calls (N calls ) each day and that each contact attempt has a probability of success P find . Consequently, the expected number of alerts received per individual on a given day is N calls /D, and the probability of finding and quarantining him is P q =1-(1-P find ) Ncalls/D . The probability that an individual is contacted and quarantined on day d after the infection onset follows the geometric distribution Integrating all of the above, we can express the effective reproduction number R e (I) determined by the second infections generated by both fractions of quarantined f q and non quarantined f nq infected individuals as:[1] R e (I)= R e q · f q + R e nq · f nq =P susceptible · b link · (L · f q +L max · f nq )This equation's plot in Figure 1a shows that NPIs induce a positive relationship between the infected individuals in a population and the epidemic reproduction number. In particular, it is expected that the epidemic does not take-off at low infection numbers (R e (I)<1), requiring a minimum level of infections (I*) to cause an outbreak (R e (I)>1).The strength of the different components of NPIs-contact tracing capacity and speed, social distance, and transmission barriers-have nonlinear relationships with the outbreak threshold I* (Fig. 1b) . Alternative states 8,17 of growing and diminishing epidemic was considered elsewhere for COVID-19 but as a response to the strength of NPIs 2, [9] [10] [11] . Here, we show that for a fixed level of saturating NPIs, the transition from contention to outbreak (i.e. R e (I)<1⇒ R e (I)>1) may be determined by the number of infected individuals (Fig. 1a, b) .In a deterministic system with a saturation of NPIs that induces an Allee effect (hereafter NPI-Allee effect), infections are expected to either vanish or take-off. However, at low numbers, pulses of immigration of infected individuals and super spreading events could determine the transition from a negative to a positive disease growth rate if the threshold is exceeded 26 . In this section, we assess the qualitative consequences of the saturation of NPIs on disease dynamics through a SIR model considering stochasticity and infection pulses with a heavy tailed distribution.The NPI-Allee effect is introduced in the daily rate of disease transmission through a saturating function b t (I)= b max ·I(t)/(I 50.b +I(t)) and also in the average duration of the infection period, g t (I)= g max ·I(t)/(I 50.g +I(t)):Where = b max and , g= g max (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Figure 1 ).Observed dynamics of cumulative cases of COVID-19 and SIR models simulations with and without NPI-Allee effect. Trajectories are described by segmented regressions on log(Ct)=µ·log(t) with the slopes µ1 and µ2 representing the rate of cases accumulation before and after the breakpoint. (a) COVID-19 dynamics in U.S. counties (blue circles) frequently shown an initial phase with low rate of increase in cumulative cases followed by a transition to a faster growth rate. The initial slope (µ1) is shown in the horizontal axis as log 10 (1+ µ1) and the relative increment in slope after the breaking point (µ2/ µ1) is shown in the vertical axis as log 10 (1+ µ2/µ1). This dynamic is frequently observed in the SIR model with NPI-Allee effect (red contours) but not in models without this effect (green contours). Red and green density plots were estimated from 1000 simulated SIR dynamics with and without NPI-Allee effect, with parameters: b max =0.5, g max =4, p=0.8, m=1, I 50.g =I 50.b =10 and s=0.2, with population sizes sampled from a log-Normal distribution with equal mean and variance than U.S. counties populations. Simulations covering a wide range of plausible parameters for COVID-19 consistently support the congruence of observed dynamics with the NPI-Allee The observed dynamics show several cases with a striking similarity to the NPI-Allee effect simulations, with abrupt transitions from slow to fast growth rate and a delayed tipping point.Amidst an ongoing worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, studies connecting NPIs and disease dynamics are all the more needed 1, [4] [5] [6] [7] 16 . Our results link NPIs with the substantial knowledge built around the Allee effect and tipping points in ecology 12, 15, 17, 26, 28 , and previous studies that related the saturation of NPIs, reactive individual behaviour, and positive feedbacks with disease dynamics 8, 21, 22, 29 . The recognition of an NPI-Allee effect and the existence of tipping points contributes to the understanding of several features of disease dynamics 12, 13, 26 .An immediate consequence is the understanding that the timing of NPIs is crucial.Interventions implemented when the disease has had enough time to surpass the correspondent threshold will fail in its containment 8, 10, 22 . Similarly, the relaxation of NPIs has to be done in attention to the epidemic threshold for avoiding outbreak resurgence. The idea of relaxing interventions and then returning them to former levels if the number of infected individuals increases may be futile after the tipping point. NPIs may be relaxed cautiously following the decrease in the number of infections with attention to potential tipping points (Fig.1d) , a context where early warning indicators become crucial. These indicators were related to systems resilience and increased trajectory variance 17 , but more specific indicators for diseases under NPIs management are probably required. For example, in a contained state of the disease, the fraction of reported infections with no epidemiological link (not detected by the tracing system), and the time between individual exposure and quarantine should decrease through time. A systematic increase in these indicators may be an adequate early warning signal that containment could be compromised.Recognizing the NPIs-induced Allee effect has large consequences for the understanding and management of COVID-19 and other diseases and may significantly expand the theoretical framework for the application of NPIs in ongoing and future epidemics. This knowledge is of particular relevance for explaining the past dynamics of COVID-19 in different regions of the world and, more importantly, as input for guiding NPIs relaxation strategies and preventing new outbreaks.Country and regional COVID-19 daily data and demographic data were obtained from Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Data Repository 31 .All the code used in this work is available at https://github.com/almadana/alle.covid/.",Uruguay,first author,2020-09-15,9
f17374461c45f90b8be4054eb88698df35791fa2,The influence of pH on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity Authors,"As of August 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected over 20 million people worldwide (World Health Organization). The new coronavirus disease 2019 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a broad range of symptoms, from respiratory to neurological and digestive problems (1, 2) . Although a small fraction of patients develop highly lethal pneumonia, at least 20% of COVID-19 patients may display one or more gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (1), such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (2, 3) .SARS-CoV-2 tissue tropism can be directly linked to the diverse clinical manifestations of COVID-19. The receptor used by the virus to enter the cells is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found in several tissues, including the GI epithelial cells and liver cells (4, 5) . SARS-CoV-2 was detected in biopsies of several tissues, including esophagus, stomach, duodenum and rectum, and endoscopy of hospitalized patients revealed esophageal bleeding with erosions and ulcers (2, 6) .Higher levels of ACE2 in the tissues may explain in part some of the comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19. Recently, we showed that ACE2 was highly expressed in the lungs of people with pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic obstructive diseases (7) . Since the expression of ACE2 changes under conditions of cell stress, elevated glucose levels and hypoxia (8, 9) , other comorbidities related to the GI tract can be associated with different forms of COVID-19.We manually curated the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) to find esophagus transcriptome datasets related to ""Barrett's esophagus"" and cell line transcriptome datasets related to ""acidosis"" and ""pH reduction"". Author-normalized expression values and metadata from these datasets were downloaded using the GEOquery package (11) . We performed differential expression analyses using the limma package (12) . The GEO study ID and the groups of samples compared are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . The MetaVolcanoR package (13) was used to combine the P values using the Fisher's method. To adjust for multiple comparisons, we calculated the false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. For enrichment analyses, we utilized the EnrichR tool (14) and fgsea R package (15) with gene sets from the Gene Ontology Biological Process database. We then selected pathways with a P value adjusted for multiple comparisons lower than 0.10.The single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from esophagus, Barrett's esophagus, gastric and duodenum cells from patients with BE were acquired from Owen et al. 2018 (16) . Cells with less than 1,000 genes were excluded from analysis using Seurat v3 (17) . Raw UMI counts were log transformed and variable genes called on each dataset independently based on the VST method. The AddModuleScore function was used to remove batch effects between samples and based on C1orf43, CHMP2A, EMC7, GPI, PSMB2, PSMB4, RAB7A, REEP5, SNRPD3, VCP, VPS29 genes. We assigned scores for S and G2/M cell cycle phases based on previously defined gene sets using the CellCycleScoring function. Scaled z-scores for each gene were calculated using the ScaleData function and regressed against the number of UMIs per cell, mitochondrial RNA content, S phase score, G2/M phase score, and housekeeping score. Scaled data was used as an input into PCA based on variable genes.Buffy coats provided by the Hematology and Hemotherapy Center of the University of Campinas (SP-Campinas, Brazil) were used for PBMC isolation as described (9) . The study was approved by the Brazilian Committee for Ethics in Human Studies (CAAE: 31622420.0.0000.5404). Briefly, buffy coats were mixed and then diluted in Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) (1:1) and carefully to 50 mL tube containing Ficoll (Sigma-Aldrich) andcentrifuged. PBMCs were cultured in RPMI 1640 for 2-3h to allow cell adhesion. Next, cells were washed twice with PBS and adherent cells, enriched in monocytes, were further incubated until infection in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1%Penicillin-Streptomycin (Pen-Strep) at 37ºC with 5% CO2. Monocytes were maintained in different pH levels (6, 6.5, and 7.4) during 24h and subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2, as described below.HIAE-02 SARS-CoV-2/SP02/human/2020/BRA (GenBank MT126808.1) virus was isolated as described (9) . Stocks of Sars-CoV-2 were prepared in the Vero cell line. The supernatant was harvested at 2-3 dpi. Viral titers were obtained by plaque assays on Vero cells.Monocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.1 under continuous agitation at 15 rpm for 1 h. Next, monocytes were washed twice and incubated in RPMI with 10% FBS and 1% Pen-Strep for 24h at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24 hours.Total RNA extraction was performed using TRIzol Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). RNA concentration was measured with NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).We retrieved clinical data from two independent cohorts of 551 and 806 RT-qPCR confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 18 years or older that went to reference hospitals for COVID-19 in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil (North region cohort) and in São José do Rio Preto city, São Paulo, Brazil (Southeast region cohort), respectively. They were followed for at least 28 days (North region cohort) or 120 days (Southeast region cohort) after recruitment. Adjusted hazard ratios and risk ratios with respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for time to death and ICU admittance, respectively by Cox regression and log-binomial generalized linear model models. To adjust for confounders, ages higher than 60 years old and obesity, defined by both BMI and fat percentage, were used as covariables in the multivariable analyses. Wilcoxon Rank-Sum analysis was used to test differences in the days of hospitalization. A 2-tailed P < 0.05 was considered significant. The statistical analyses were carried out using Stata v. 13.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).were incubated in medium at 3 different pH (6, 6.5, 7.4) for 24h. Each boxplot represents the fold change ACE2 expression. D. Acid pH increases SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Human peripheral blood monocytes were incubated in medium at 3 different pH (6, 6.5, 7.4) for 24h.The cells were infected with CoV-2 (MOI 0.1) for 1h under continuous agitation. The RNA viral load was measured by qPCR.Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) decrease the amount of acid produced in the stomach and are often utilized to treat subjects with GERD symptoms or with certain stomach and esophagus problems (22) . The use of PPIs prior to COVID-19 may serve as a proxy for identifying subjects with tissue irritation and inflammation caused by stomach acid. In two independent cohorts of 551 and 806 RT-qPCR confirmed COVID-19 patients from North and Southeast regions of Brazil, respectively, we investigated the effects of gastrointestinal discomfort and COVID-19 severity. Survival curve analysis showed that people using PPIs had a 2-to 3-fold higher risk of death compared to those not using the drug ( Figure 4A ).Tables S1 and S2",Brazil,first author,2020-09-11,9

As a global community, many of us would agree that the last few months have been tough, especially given the novel COVID-19 viral pandemic. As of 3 July 2020, COVID-19 has killed half a million people worldwide [1] .Nevertheless, when we thought that things could not get any worse, George Floyd, a Black man, was killed on 25 May by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, for committing a nonviolent crime [2] . Mr. Floyd's death sparked protests about racism, particularly anti-Black racism, in North America, that have spread worldwide.Racism is a public health problem [3] . There is data showing that racial discrimination, perceived either as a single question or using validated questionnaires on the subject, affects maternal and neonatal outcomes [4] . A cross-sectional national survey of general surgery residents in 2018 reported that 16.6% experienced racial discrimination; patients and patients' families were the most frequent sources of racial discrimination (47.4%) [5] .Moreover, implicit biases can be developed by societal influences that create the perception of our population. A recent study with physicians that work in the acute care surgery arena revealed a high prevalence of implicit bias against Black (49%) and Hispanic (63%) people, despite 88% of the respondents stating that they had no explicit preference for white people [6] . Black surgeons and their professional career are less likely to remain in academia and Black assistant professors have the lowest rates of promotion [7] .Despite equal rights efforts of the last half-century, Black people still suffer the effects of racism, resulting in inequities in health care. Black women have a substantially higher risk of severe maternal morbidity and mortality than white women, even adjusting for confounders [8] . Black women are more likely to undergo abdominal hysterectomy, despite a nationwide trend in the USA toward minimally invasive hysterectomy [9] . Within the COVID-19 pandemic, we are seeing substantial racial/ethnic disparities between Black people and white people worldwide [10, 11] .Although a shock to many, Mr. Floyd's death is one of thousands of unnecessary deaths of Black people as a result of structural anti-Black racism. Perhaps Mr. Floyd's unfortunate death will be the final catalyst to spark permanent change. We need to explore this subject in our area; there is a need for addressing racism in our field due to the lack of studies. We do not have data on whether Black women have barriers to access to diagnosis and treatment on urogynecological disorders. Several medical societies published a statement condemning racism and supporting the Black community. These are admirable first steps, but we, as urogynecologists and global citizens, must have intent and take action in our fight to eradicate anti-Black racism. We must admonish racism in all spaces, even those that our Black colleagues, friends, and patients might not inhabit. We need to know our own local data regarding racial disparities and discuss with our multidisciplinary group how to remove barriers to access for these patients. Involving patients in this discussion will be crucial for us to hear their voices. We must continue to study how racism influences the outcome of our urogynecology patients to ensure good-quality and equitable care. We need to be attentive, to advocate for Black women's health, and to ensure that these patients receive the proper diagnosis and treatment.Conflicts of interest None.",Brazil,first author,2020-09-08,9
090b71b47082ba1201883377c950f5bb2bde7982,Journal Pre-proof Estimative of real number of infections by COVID-19 in Brazil and possible scenarios Estimative of real number of infections by COVID-19 in Brazil and possible scenarios,"The virus quickly spread to other countries, reaching 23 several countries by the end of February and being declared 24 as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 25 the 11th of March, being classified as a high risk threat for 26 the world's population [3] . Since then, several mathematical 27 models were used to predict the dynamics of the pandemic 28 crisis in other countries. One of those models with the biggest 29 impact was developed by Imperial College London [4] . 30 In Brazil, the first case registered dates back to February 31 25th, but in this study we suggest evidence that the infection 32 might have started 19 to 24 days before the official record. 33 We then proceed to simulate the crisis in specific states and 34 attempt to estimate the real scale of the outbreak, predicting 35 when the infections peak might occur as well as the curve 36 for ICU demand. Finally, we present some future scenarios 37 based on how halting the intervention might affect the curve. 38 We also explore how the introduction of vaccines or available 39 medication might change the infection curve since there are 40 several studies being made to evaluate the possible use of 41 pharmaceutical drugs to cure the disease [5] , [6] and [7] . 42 43 We make use of a SEIRD model, dividing the population 44 into 5 groups: Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered 45 and Dead. The exposed population differs from the infected 46 1 Physics Institute, University of Brasilia, Brasilia, Brazil population in the development of their symptoms; an 47 individual with the virus first enters first the exposed group, 48 carrying the virus during its incubation period; then, after the 49 incubation period, the individual passes to the infected group. 50 The rate of infection is proportional to the number of infected 51 and a contact constant β, which is given by the average 52 number of contacts between individuals multiplied by the 53 probability of contracting the virus during each contact. 54 The development rate of symptoms is proportional to the 55 incubation period c −1 . The rate of recovery γ is proportional 56 to the percentage of people who recover divided by the 57 average time taken from the onset of symptoms to recovery, 58 similarly to the death rate µ. Another consideration is that 59 people in the exposed group might infect susceptible people 60 with an infection rate k which is a small fraction of β, that is, 61 k = P exp β, where P exp determines the fraction of infections 62 caused by exposed individuals. 63 The following diagram represents the dynamics of these 64 populations: 65 Susceptible S(t)Dead D(t)Exposed E(t) βI(t)S(t) + kE(t)S(t) cE(t) γI(t) µI(t) Fig. 1 : Representation of a SEIRD model, a susceptible person gets exposed to the virus, being infected afterwards and either dies or recovers from the disease.where the recovery rate γ and death rate µ are represented 68 in terms of the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) P IF R and the 69 average time from the onset of symptoms to recovery τ r and 70 death τ d . where M is the number of age groups, C ij is the social 85 contact matrix, representing the average contacts between a 86 member of the i-th group with all other j-th groups and P Inf 87 is the probability of being infected at each contact.With these definitions, we represent non-pharmaceutical 89 interventions such as social isolation and lockdown with a 90 decrease of β given by a logistic function of the type According to [9] , 3.6% of COVID-19 infections are severe 109 and require hospitalization of which 30% are critical and 110 require an ICU unit. Some studies found a hospitalization 111 rate of around 14% [10] . Yet another study found similar 112 percentages, stating that 19% of the infections resulted 113 in hospitalizations [11] . However, these studies calculate 114 these fractions according to the registered cases, which are 115 undernotified in many regions.With the emergence of the novel coronavirus, the number 117 of hospitalizations by SARS per week increased when 118 compared to the years of 2019, 2018 and 2017. It is 119 important to state that SARS hospitalizations here should 120 not be misunderstood as caused by the SARS-CoV virus, 121 responsible for the SARS epidemic in 2002 [12] . In Brazil, 122 the term SARS is also used to describe severe acute 123 respiratory infection, independent of the etiological agent. 124 Using the number of hospitalizations by SARS during these 125 years, we build a value for the background behavior, that 126 is, the expected number of hospitalizations due to other 127 respiratory diseases ( Figure 2 ). The number reported by the 128 Health Ministry per week is subject to alterations due to the 129 fact that new results in the following weeks may be related 130 to previous ones, as new results are released. For example, 131 by the end of the 6th week of the year 2018, the official 132 report estimates a number of hospitalizations of around 50 133 people, but later on, this number was corrected to be close 134 to 200. Because of this uncertainty in the most recent data, 135 we use the values available from four weeks before the most 136 recent report ( Figure 3 ). . We assume 147 the same increase could be found from 2019 to 2020, thus, 148 we consider that COVID-19 is responsible for 90% of the 149 increase. 150 We observed that by the 6th week of 2020, the number 151 of hospitalizations by SARS was 121 hospitalizations higher, 152 compared to the upper error bar of the background value, and 153 higher even than the year of 2019 by 106 hospitalizations, 154 representing an increase of 31%, evidencing the likely 155 existence of COVID-19 hospitalizations. According to a 156 study performed on COVID-19 patients in Shanghai, the 157 hospitalization occurs on average 4 days after the symptoms 158 onset, ranging from 2 to 7 days [13]. The study, together 159 with the increase of SARS hospitalizations by the 6th week 160 of 2020 suggests the possible existence of COVID-19 cases 161 in Brazil between February 1st and February 6th, 19 to 24 162 days before the official record of the first case on the 25th 163 of February. undocumented infections is -0.79. A F-Test applied to the 206 data set of both relations rejected the null hypothesis and that 207 the variation of tests and the variation of undernotification are 208 not significantly correlated (p < 0.05). We also compared the 209 undocumented cases with the progression of the outbreak in 210 each country and the day on which the non-pharmaceutical 211 interventions were imposed, but found no correlation. We 212 evaluated the effect of the increasing rate of testing as well, 213 but it had no observable effect. From this comparison, a 214 country needs to perform 4 (0.94 -17 tests) tests per day 215 per 1000 inhabitants in order to obtain a excellent track of 216 infections. Here, the large margin for the higher values of 217 testing arises from the low density of data points on the 218 bigger values of the x-axis in Figure 4 .The last official registration of the total number of tests 220 done per 1000 inhabitants in Brazil of was 3.46, which 221 corresponds to 97% of cases being lost (89 -99.2%). 222 However, the highest value released on the closest date 223 to the 13th epidemiological week, reports 1.37 tests per 224 1000 inhabitants, corresponding to 98.8% of infections 225 being undocumented (95.6 -99.7%). A more precise 226 number could be achieved with the data of tests per day 227 per 1000 inhabitants, allowing a 2-dimensional regression. 228 Unfortunately, we found no record of this information. Still, 229 when fitting the data to a 2-dimensional regression algorithm, 230 the resulting function states that the most important factor 231 controlling the uncertainty of cases is that of tests per 232 day per 1000 inhabitants. That could also be observed by 233 looking at the graphs individually, the number of total tests 234 performed per 1000 inhabitants decreases the percentage 235 of undocumented infections at a much lower rate than the 236 number of tests per day per 1000 inhabitants. (This distribution will be used when 248 simulating the expected scenario for the whole country; when 249 considering more specific age distributions for each state, 250 we acquired data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography 251 and Statistics (IBGE) census, mentioned in the following 252 sections regarding each state). We found no study measuring 253 the social contact matrix for the country, but the study [22] 254 evaluated the high levels of social contact in Brazil as an 255 important factor for the spreading of leprosy. Therefore, we 256 decided to use the social contact matrix found with the 257 highest entries among those available (Poland) due to the 258 Brazilian's culture of proximity.For the values of γ and µ we choose to use the ones 260 found in the data of South Korea, Germany, Iceland and 261 Taiwan, since these countries are performing more tests per 262 1000 inhabitants than Brazil, making their data more reliable 263 (Figures 6 and 7 When fitting the data of those countries with the model 274 to extract β (Table II) , we took into consideration in 275 the simulations the non-pharmaceutical intervention in each 276 country in order to better describe β. The value of β was 277 used to set a reference to compare with the ones found with 278 the fitting of data from each state. For the incubation period c −1 , we took an average of the 280 values found in previous studies (Table III) The value for k was set to 44% of β based on the findings 282 that showed that presyntomatic cases were responsible for 283 44% of the infections [30]. The parameter P IF R for each 284 age group was set by re-scaling the international average of 285 the case fatality rate (CFR) [31] with the estimated infection 286 fatality rate of 0.7% [9] , ranging from 0.001% for those 287 younger than 20 years old to 10.1% to those older than 80 288 years old (Table IV) To simulate the ICU population, we added the hospitalized In the simulation for the whole country, we considered N 307 to be 5% of the total population based on an international 308 behavior for the total number of infections in other 309 countries [9] . We also selected P Inf = 14% according to The curve (Figure 8) shows a good agreement with the 319 estimated values by the number of SARS hospitalizations 320 in the last weeks of March, shown by the + mark on the 321 graph. We also predict that the peak of the infection curve 322 in Brazil should occur 100 days after the first case, which we 323 considered to be at the beginning of February. Therefore, the 324 peak should be in the middle to end of May with 2.4 million 325 infections, ranging from 2.2 to 2.7 million. The number 326 of deaths is estimated to be around 126 thousand, ranging 327 from 114 to 139 thousand. By the end of the first wave, we 328 estimate 8 million infections, ranging from 6.4 to 9.6 million. 329 The shaded areas represent a 10% deviation from the 330 simulated curve. The value of the deviation was chosen as 331 a reflection of the uncertainty in the value for the effective 332 population N .Online data available from the local government in [36] 335 states a total of 0.84 tests per 1000 inhabitants and an 336 average of 0.05 tests per day per 1000 inhabitants, meaning 337 that more than 90% of infections are being undocumented. 338 For the simulation, we acquired data regarding the age and 339 geographical distribution of the population from the last 340 census from IBGE [37].The official record for the first case dates to the 12th of 342 March, however, data from [36] From figure 10 we expect a higher ICU demand than the 370 maximum capacity for Pernambuco, however, the capacity 371 may be increased with the construction of campaign 372 hospitals.In Espirito Santo, the online data provided by the 375 government states a total of 6.70 tests per 1000 inhabitants 376 realized, placing the uncertainty percentage close to 88% (78 377 -98). There are also 161 ICU units available for COVID-19 378 cases [39] . The population data for the simulations was 379 retrieved from a local census done by IBGE [40] . The 380 isolation index is on average 45% [35].Like Pernambuco, the fitting on the Espirito Santo data 382 reveals a good agreement of β with international parameters, 383 β = 0.436 ± 0.199. However, the large error margin of the 384 data lowers the confidence in it. 385 We found no record of previous hospitalizations due to 386 COVID-19 prior the first case announced on March 6th, as 387 we did for Pernambuco. Therefore, we chose the official 388 day as the starting point of the disease. The first infectious 389 individual was in the 30-39 years old age group. Like in the previous states, the IBGE census was used to 407 extract the population's distribution [42] . 408 The fit of the data with the simulations returns an 409 efficiency of 88% of social isolation, but β and τ d are 410 off the margin of acceptance, indicating that the state is 411 not efficiently tracking the rate of the increase of deaths 412 and cases, possibly invalidating the estimated percentage of 413 the efficiency of the social isolation. The isolation index 414 according to [35] is on average 50%. The simulation shows that the Federal District is currently 416 at its highest number of infections, around 10000 (8000 -417 12000). The maximum number of deaths is projected to reach 418 190 (158 -228). Also, with the current number of infections, 419 the Federal District is losing 89% of its cases (87 -91%), in 420 agreement with the margin estimated by the number of tests 421 performed (Figure 13 ).From the AMIB census, the state posseses 659 ICU beds. 423 We assume an occupation of 80% before the disease reached 424 the state. The state has its peak projected to be around the 70th day 449 of infection, or close to the 7th of May (Figures 15 and 16) . 450 The peak number of infections should be 260000 (208000 -451 312000). For the number of deaths, the estimate is close to 452 6500 (5200 -7800).From the AMIB census, the state of Sao Paulo has a 454 total of 7312 ICU beds and recent news point to 53% of 455 them already being occupied, leaving around 3400 ICU beds 456 available for COVID-19 treatment. The census from IBGE [44] was also used here to acquire 471 population data for the state.From the AMIB census, Amazonas posseses 249 ICU 473 beds, with 55% of them being occupied before the outbreak. 474 Unfortunately, no data on tests was found for Amazonas, 475 therefore we consider a 90% loss of infections. Amazonas peak is estimated to occur on May 16th, with a 477 20000 infections peak (16000 -24000). Deaths are estimated 478 to reach 500 in total (400 -600) (Figure 18 ). Several 479 hospitalization issues are expected during the pandemic 480 through the region ( Figure 19 ); given the concentration of 481 indigenous tribes throughout the Amazon rain forest territory, 482 it should be expected for there to be a high density of cases 483 in the indigenous population. From the simulations, the safest method is not to stop 519 the intervention and introduce the vaccines or drugs into the 520 population, and then wait a small period of 10 days before 521 halting the intervention. would be the testing data, the states which provided testing 572 data, did only for the whole state but not for individual cities. 573 We did not consider comorbidities in the population such as 574 diabetes and cancer, however the age of the individual seems 575 to be the most important factor in determining mortality 576 factors [51] . 577 We also state here that the nature of the process 578 is stochastic, allowing fluctuations from the deterministic 579 model used to run the simulations. Thus, this study present 580 an estimate of the real situation and expected behavior given 581 the parameters associated with the disease and the efficiency 582 of the intervention. The above results present the dimension 583 of the real scenario, but due to possible initial fluctuations 584 in the stochastic behavior in reality, we might find some 585 deviations from the expected.Even with limitations, the model has proven efficient 587 in generating curves that agree with the estimated loss of 588 cases for each state. From the states studied here, Sao 589 Paulo, Amazonas and Pernambuco present the highest risk 590 of collapse in the health system, while Espirito Santo and 591 the Federal District should have minor issues with system 592 collapse or none at all. The blue curve representing the 593 behavior of the official data considering the error percentage 594 for Amazonas exhibited a growth far from the simulation 595 region, however, it falls perfectly inside this region when 596 data is translated by 10 days, meaning that if the infection 597 in Amazonas begun 10 days earlier than previously thought, 598 the data fits the simulated curve. 599 In the case of the duration of social isolation, the safer 600 situation is to hold the isolation for as long as possible in 601 order to decrease the second peak height, while increasing 602 the number of tests performed. All simulations considered 603 here did not assume the end of the intervention, therefore, 604 numbers of deaths may be higher. Should any efficient drugs 605 in combating the virus come along, the simulations show the 606 safer way is to first introduce them in the population without 607 breaking the social isolation, and about 10 days later start 608 the process of reopening.of the reproductive number of novel coronavirus (covid-19) and 662 the probable outbreak size on the diamond princess cruise ship: A",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-24,9
1b0750ca457cae732c86f2bbddb55306e46a9594,COVID-19 in a patient with advanced Merkel cell carcinoma receiving immunotherapy,"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, causing a wide spectrum of severity and being classified by the WHO as a public health emergency of international concern. To date, WHO estimates that this pandemic has affected 20 million people and taken the lives of more than 750,000 individuals worldwide, not including the unreported cases; and its reach and severity continue to spread [1] .Despite the alarming numbers, the burden of this disease and clinical course has been poorly characterized in cancer patients. Initial reports suggested an increased risk for severe forms of COVID-19 in this population [2, 3] , posing a major concern for oncologists and healthcare providers in this new scenario. Susceptibility to infections is greater in individuals with cancer because of their immunosuppressive state related to the tumor and oncological treatments (chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy) [2, 3] . A Chinese study has analyzed 18 cancer patients and compared them with 1572 patients without cancer. After adjusting for age, comorbidities and smoking history, cancer was associated with a higher risk of severe events, defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission requiring invasive ventilation, or death (OR: 5.4; 95% CI: 1.80-16.18; p = 0.0026); in addition, cancer patients presented severe events earlier than patients without cancer (median time 13 vs 43 days, respectively; HR: 3.56; 95% CI: 1.65-7.69; p < 0.0001) [3] .Another area of uncertainty is whether patients receiving different types of antitumor treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, target-therapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors [ICI] ) are subject to distinct risks and outcomes of COVID-19.As an example, the use of ICI such as anti-programmed death 1/ligand-1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) monoclonal antibodies has led to a new understanding of oncology [4] , but many questions about immunomodulation process are still an area of intense research [5, 6] and the role of ICI as a risk or protective factor in SARS-Cov-2 infection has yet to be elucidated. In this setting, the differential diagnosis between ICI-induced pneumonitis and COVID-19 can be a challenge, since both may share similarities in clinical presentation and overlapping radiological findings, but distinct therapeutic approaches [7, 8] . Here we describe the successful management of a patient with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma that developed a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection while receiving pembrolizumab.A 66-year-old man, former smoker, with a history of hypertension and diabetes, was diagnosed in 2018 with a Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) of the gluteal region measuring 3.0 cm in the greatest diameter (pathological staging: pT2pN0, stage IIA) that was treated with surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy. In February 2019, a distant tumor relapse in a perigastric lymph node was confirmed. The patient started systemic therapy with avelumab 10 mg/kg every 14 days, however, he developed recurrent infusion reactions despite the use of prophylactic premedications, increasing in severity until the third cycle, which led to a substitution for pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. The patient reached a complete metabolic response in November 2019 ( Figure 1 ).After 13 cycles of maintenance pembrolizumab (last infusion: 5 March 2020), the patient presented with fever, but no respiratory symptoms initially. Chest CT was performed and showed a bilateral pulmonary inflammatory pattern (day 1), comprising the possibilities of a viral infection or immune-related pneumonitis attributable to pembrolizumab ( Figure 2 ). As the patient was oligosymptomatic and in good general condition, immunotherapy was suspended and home isolation indicated, with daily medical follow-up. COVID-19 test was not performed on outpatients, in compliance with the recommendations of the Brazilian Ministry of Health at that time. On day 7 (23 March 2020), the patient was admitted to the hospital due to the onset of dyspnea. RT-PCR testing was positive for SARS-CoV-2 and chest CT demonstrated a significant worsening of the bilateral pulmonary ground-glass opacities ( Figure 2 ). Despite the initial support, the patient evolved to acute respiratory distress syndrome and developed acute kidney injury on day 9 (Table 1) , requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and wide spectrum antibiotics, including azithromycin. Hydroxychloroquine was added on day 12, but discontinued 5 days later due to supraventricular extrasystoles. Although the patient showed improvements in renal function and ventilatory parameters, he maintained impaired consciousness following sedation withdrawal. A head CT and electroencephalogram were obtained, and showed no significant abnormalities. Cerebrospinal fluid examination did not show signs of infection and cerebrospinal fluid RT-PCR testing was negative for SARS-CoV-2. Anticoagulation was started due to a deep vein thrombosis identified in brachial vein on day 20, and on day 25 the patient was submitted to a tracheostomy. He ultimately progressed with ventilatory and neurological improvement, and prolonged rehabilitation, until hospital discharge on 12 June 2020.Early studies have suggested that cancer patients have a higher risk of developing COVID-19 than the general population, with an increased chance of serious respiratory complications and prolonged time in the ICU [2, 3] . Whether distinct types of cancers and different antitumor treatments confer similar risks for severe SARS-Cov-2, it remains inconclusive, especially in patients receiving immunotherapy. A retrospective study conducted at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (NY, USA) sought to examine the impact of PD-1 blockade on severity of COVID-19, in which 41 (59%) out of 69 consecutive outpatients with lung cancer infected by SARS-Cov-2 were previously treated with anti-PD-1 therapy. Parameters such as hospitalization (OR: 1.66; 95% CI: 0.6-4.60), ICU/intubation/do not intubate (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.42-3.40) and death (OR: 1.81; 95% CI: 0.57-6.43) were not statistically significant for the association of PD-1 blockade exposure and COVID-19 severity [9] . Despite these results, data from the same institution showed different conclusions: in a multivariate analysis of 423 cancer patients, ICI treatment was a predictor of severe respiratory illness (HR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.37-5.46; p = 0.004) and also a predictor of hospitalization for COVID-19 (OR: 2.84; 95% CI: 1.24-6.72; p = 0.013) [10] . In an effort to understand the risk factors for morbidity and mortality from this novel virus, a global consortium (TERAVOLT) recently reported data from eight countries including a total of 200 patients with COVID-19 and thoracic cancers. Chemotherapy-immunotherapy combination and ICI alone were performed in 14 and 23%, respectively; but they did not impact on risk of death (OR: 0.989; 95% CI: 0.276-3.183 for chemotherapy-immunotherapy and OR: 1.385; 95% CI: 0.524-3.639 for ICI alone) [11] . All these results should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations of each study, such as small sample size, retrospective analysis, short prospective follow-up, selected population, pre-existing individual diseases, recent or previous smoking and other methodological bias.Furthermore, the relationship of immunomodulation and severity of SARS-Cov-2 infection was also correlated with NK and T-cell exhaustion during the immune response, which may result in viral disease progression and rapid clinical decompensation. In a cohort of 68 COVID-19 patients (55 with mild disease [MD] and 13 with severe disease [SD]), the total NK and CD8 + T cells counts by peripheral blood samples were collected on admission at the Anhui Medical University in China. Patients with SD have significantly lower number of T cells, CD8 + T cell and NK cells counts compared with those with MD (p < 0.05) and 25 healthy controls (p < 0.0001), indicating an innate and adaptive exhaustion related to SARS-Cov-2 infection [12] . These results are in accordance with the laboratorial findings of Guan et al., which reported lymphocytopenia related to COVID-19 in 83.2% of the patients on hospital admission [13] . Exhausted T cells upregulate selectively PD-1 receptors, and anti-PD-1 blockade can restore T CD8 + functions such as proliferation, cytokines secretion and cell death. The use of anti-PD-1 therapy has been associated with an increased cellular immunity in cases of viral, bacterial and fungal infections [14] , also decreasing viral load in vivo [15] . However, overactivation of T cells contributes to a severe immune injury, leading to COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome [16] . Therefore, the use of immunotherapy could potentially affect the response and course of a viral infection, although the role of anti-PD-1 therapy and COVID-19 severity is not yet established in prospective randomized trials.In addition, the clinical and radiological similarities between COVID-19 and ICI-induced pneumonitis may represent a pitfall in clinical practice. Pneumonitis as an immune-related adverse event (irAE) affects almost 5% of patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in monotherapy and approximately 10% in anti-CTLA-4/anti-PD-1 combination therapy [17] , rarely leading to death [18] . Radiological features of ICI-induced pneumonitis are non specific, including parenchymal consolidations, interstitial pneumonia and peribronchial or peripheral ground-glass opacities [19] . The latter is the most common radiological finding related to SARS-Cov-2, accounting for 56.4-75.0% of cases [13, 20] , and the former (46.3%) is related to a higher risk for developing severe COVID-19 events (HR: 5.438; 95% CI: 1.498-19.748; p = 0.010) [20] . COVID-19 pneumonia mimicking ICI-induced pneumonitis was also discussed by Artigas et al., reporting that hypermetabolic ground glass opacities with peripheral distribution by 18F-FDG PET/CT may appear even in SARS-Cov-2 infection or irAE induced by anti-PD-1 therapy [21] . Therefore, differential diagnosis between irAEs and SARS-Cov-2 infection always deserves a dedicated workup.Guidelines have been published to guide and allow safe patient care, without jeopardizing the ongoing oncological treatment [22] , including recommendations for skin cancer management [23] . In this context, preventive measures must be implemented in oncology departments, in order to minimize patient exposure to COVID-19. Early diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 with RT-PCR is essential, even in asymptomatic patients, preventing nosocomial spread in cancer clinics [24] . Shared decision making with physicians and patients about delays in the oncologic treatment must occur, considering an individual's risk of COVID-19 complications against the worse prognosis from postponed cancer therapy [23] . Retrospective data suggest that chemo-immunotherapy can be safely delivered even in this pandemic scenario, but sometimes may require regimen modifications or alternative schedules that should also be determined on an individual basis [25] .Testing for the novel coronavirus is a top priority in response to the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, avoiding equivocal diagnosis or treatment delays. A careful evaluation and a rapid assessment of oncologic patients receiving ICI during the COVID-19 pandemic are essential. Gathering evidences to better characterize the spectrum of manifestations of COVID-19 and to guide tailored management algorithms in patients receiving ICI remains of utmost importance.• The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern.• The role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection has not been established yet in prospective trials, although retrospective data suggest that chemo-immunotherapy can be safely delivered, eventually requiring regimen modifications or alternative schedules determined on an individual basis. • NK cells and T lymphocytes exhaustion during the immune response against the SARS-Cov-2 infection is associated with PD-1 upregulation, viral disease progression and clinical decompensation. • Anti-PD-1 blockade can restore T CD8 + functions, which improves cellular immunity.• Immune overactivation, however, can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome related to COVID-19.• Suspected SARS-Cov-2 infection may mimic immune-related adverse events in those patients receiving immunotherapy, especially pneumonitis, which deserves a dedicated workup. • Testing for the novel coronavirus is a top priority in response to the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, avoiding equivocal diagnosis or treatment delays.

f9658505bae4b69f2aa288b52cc1ab801f46ce5f,Small-scale gold mining and the COVID-19 pandemic: Conflict and cooperation in the Brazilian Amazon,"Growing attention has been paid to the impact of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on gold mining in Brazil. Decrees N°10.282 (March 25 th , 2020) and N°10.329 (April 28 th , 2020) from the Federal Government and Ordinance N°135/GM (March 28 th , 2020) from the Ministry of Mines and Energy, characterized mining as an ""essential"" activity, guaranteeing its continuity during the pandemic. This led to heated debate in Brazil regarding whether miners should continue to work or not. Although the objective of the decrees was to ensure the continued supply of inputs and employment indispensable to the economy, there has been widespread concern that the Ministry of Mines and Energy is blind to the risk of infection associated with mining activities. In effect, it is operating in line with a general attitude within President Jair Bolsonaro's government that denies the seriousness of the pandemic. In the case of gold mining, declaring it ""essential"" has no foundation in the technical features of the production and instead is a political decision 1 .In Brazil, like in other gold-rich developing countries, media coverage and political attention are directed towards large-scale mining operations (Hilson et al., 2020) , leaving a big gap in understanding of artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). Important questions in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic are how communities of artisanal and small-scale gold miners (garimpeiros in Brazilian Portuguese) in the Brazilian Amazon are being affected by the crisis and how they act upon the consequences of the pandemic.As ASGM is characterized by deep socio-environmental conflicts, it helps us to contextualize the answers to these questions in terms of layers that characterize these conflicts. The framework proposed by Salman et al. (2018) provides us with a logic to analyze processes of conflict through which structures are built, who are the actors involved and how they interact, where do they come from, which are their expectations and what are their strategies for organization and mobilization. This framework helps us to 'unpack' different dimensions of garimpeiros' response to the health emergency.In April and May 2020, we collected information on how the COVID-19 crisis is impacting garimpeiros in two Amazonian regions: one https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2020.08.013 Received 8 June 2020; Received in revised form 25 August 2020; Accepted 25 August 2020 along the BR-163 highway from Peixoto de Azevedo, in the state of Mato Grosso (MT) to Itaituba, in the state of Pará (PA), and the other, Lourenço, in the state of Amapá (AP) (Fig. 1) . We must stress that the contagion of COVID-19 in the Brazilian Amazon is rapidly spreading and the situation is under constant change, but, since the early stages of the outbreak, we recognized the urgency of gathering information to provide with an overview of how garimpeiros are responding to the pandemic.COVID-19 posed methodological constraints over data collection which we solved by drawing on contacts from previous field research. In a total of eight gold mining locations, we interviewed 113 local actors directly and indirectly related to the gold mining activity, such as garimpeiros, owners of mines, owners of mining equipment shops, government representatives and institutional figures and other members of population of villages and towns. Among all these, we selected twenty-five actors with a key role in social transformation processes (therefore called ""key actors""). One such process of change in the social arenas (Ferreira, 2012; Calvimontes and Ferreira, 2016 ) that compose a context for ASGM in these regions, is that garimpeiros have organized themselves into cooperatives and associations to have legal access to the land for gold extraction (Massaro and de Theije, 2018) . Formalization entails legal, environmental, and social obstacles caused by many factors, such as garimpeiros' lack of knowledge about mining regulations and restrictions, high mobility of people, lack of trust in the State, perceived unattractiveness of formalization, and/or the slow bureaucracy required (de Theije, 2020). Cooperatives and associations are an attempt to deal with some of these issues. In all of the mining communities that are part of our research and which were visited for fieldwork in 2019, different forms of organized miners' groups are present.The use of this quota sampling strategy allowed us to select the twenty-five key actors on the basis of specific criteria as they are the most articulate respondents and the reference figures for the local ASGM communities. Therefore, we directed the interviews for this article to presidents of cooperatives and associations of miners, other individuals whose work is related to mining such as geologists, mining engineers, staff from the offices of the mining associations, garimpeiros and owner of mines, and people related to garimpeiros that live in the towns close to the mines, and government representatives. We used WhatsApp to perform oral and written semi-structured interviews with the twenty-five research participants and follow up interviews with four of them, making twenty-nine interviews in total over the eight locations ( Fig. 1) . The structure of the interviews was situational according to the position of the participant in the social arena, but always included: i) response to the COVID-19 pandemic including the measures that were introduced from the side of local, regional and federal authorities; inhabitants' perceptions and concerns; healthcare conditions and accessibility of care; ii) how the COVID-19 crisis is impacting the ASGM activity (operation, processing and commercialization); and iii) impression of the garimpeiros' response to the emergency. We carried out a content analysis, a narrative analysis and a framework analysis combining primary data from interviews and secondary data from literature as well as relevant news and official technical reports.In the following section, our results are presented according to these topics: i) the initial response to the outbreak and the decision of the gaimpeiros to keep the mines in operation; ii) the risk of contagion; iii) the situation of the local healthcare system; iv) the effect of the pandemic on the price of gold locally paid to the garimpeiros; and v) the local collaborative response to the crisis.The research participants' responses to our questions showed a high degree of similarity across the eight mining communities 2 . The situation of communities located along the BR-163 highway (Peixoto de Azevedo-MT, Guarantã do Norte-MT, Castelo dos Sonhos-PA, Novo Progresso-PA, Morais Almeida-PA and Itaituba-PA) is more or less similar, whereas in Creporizão (PA), located at the end of the Transgarimpeira road, approximately 200km from the BR-163 highway, and in Lourenço (AP) the situation appears to be a little different due to the remoteness of these sites.Despite the general concern about the pandemic, to stop the mining was not considered to be an option. Initially, after news of the COVID-19 pandemic reached the BR-163 highway region in March, strict measures of social distancing were adopted alongside the closure of shops and services. However, the local decrees supporting these measures have since been relaxed and within two months almost all commercial activities had returned to normal, except for the obligation to wear a protective mask inside shops. The spread of COVID-19 has strongly exposed pre-existing conflicts related to ASGM. A structural dimension central to these conflicts is the fact that garimpeiros belong to a heterogeneous social group that is historically vulnerable for working without formal employment contracts (de Theije, 2020). If the activity has to stop due to the pandemic, garimpeiros will quickly fail to meet their day-to-day financial responsibilities and survival needs. The economic motivation is, indeed, the main reason that pushes them to work and why the activity proceeds as normal even given the threat of illness due to the pandemic. As a garimpeiro from Lourenço declared: ""the pandemic is impacting our lives in several ways. Our incomes are compromised, and this makes us more vulnerable"". In the same vein, a garimpeiro from Peixoto de Azevedo, in agreement with most of the interviewees, explained: ""unfortunately, bills will come soon and if garimpeiros don't work, they don't receive anything, and this is the reason why people go back to work. Today, mines are running as normal"".Garimpeiros' decision to keep the mines in operation, is entangled with the political situation in Brazil where the federal government publicly down-played the seriousness of the disease. One respondent from Peixoto de Azevedo explained that, locally, people were convinced that the broadcast news about the danger of COVID-19 is ""only an intentional exaggeration to undermine the economy of the country"". People's need to work despite the risk of spreading the contagion is, indeed, at the center of the rhetoric used by President Bolsonaro as a justification for shunning away from public intervention in the mining sector, including lockdown measures. Since being elected to office in 2018, Bolsonaro promised to give free rein to garimpeiros 3 , and that he would open up the Amazon to commercial activities, including mining and large-scale farming (de Theije, 2020). He has repeatedly declared that the importance of the Amazon is not its nature or the indigenous inhabitants, but the ""wealth underneath it"" 4 . The federal government is pushing ahead with further deregulation of environmental policies, while people and media are ""distracted"" by the coronavirus pandemic 5 .Regarding the risk of contagion, garimpeiros believe they are safer in the mining site than in town, as the president of a cooperative of garimpeiros in Peixoto de Azevedo, the president of the mining association in Itaituba, and an employee from the cooperative in Castelo dos Sonhos confirmed. In practice, garimpeiros do not leave their mines very often and as a result they have a sense of being already automatically ""quarantined"". Seemingly, there were many people who went from the town to the mines precisely with the intent to isolate themselves. Nevertheless, the president of one cooperative of Peixoto de Azevedo, highly recommended to follow the official measures and in Peixoto de Azevedo it was reported that in some mines the activity had been temporally stopped and the owner of the mine had sent everyone back to their houses in the town so as not to increase the risk of contagion due to the excess of crowding in the living quarters on the mining site.While there is fear over the spread of the virus, garimpeiros believe they are taking the necessary precautions in relation to the pandemic.The president of the association in Itaituba argued that garimpeiros are very well informed, as they all have daily access to information, official bulletins and news through internet. Usually, the president and the associates rely on WhatsApp groups to exchange information about gold prices, job opportunities, and news. Today, these groups appear to be very useful to consolidate their network, organize themselves, and share information about the pandemic. In fact, some local cooperatives are publishing sporadic updates and news on their social networks' pages and websites. Nevertheless, there is a general concern about the precariousness of healthcare services in the region. An employee at the cooperative in Morais Almeida reported that if the contagion spreads, the infrastructural capacity will not be enough. Specifically, she expressed serious concern when referring to the garimpeiros: ""the moment this virus arrives at the mines it will be terrible, certainly a lot of people will die without proper care"". In her view, the local health system lacks proper infrastructure to face the pandemic. In Lourenço, a garimpeiro pointed out that their, ""little clinic is not sufficient for the local health demand, we don't have any ambulance or any instrument to prevent the spread of the virus"".Up to the time of writing, in June 2020, the sale of gold was hardly affected by the pandemic along the BR-163 highway. Some gold retailers work with reduced hours and with appropriate precautions, such as masks and social distancing measures to avoid people crowding into the shops but nevertheless the price has been stable. In contrast, in more remote areas, such as Creporizão and Lourenço, there has been a decrease in the price of gold paid to the garimpeiros despite buoyant world market prices. In these isolated regions, prior to COVID-19 it was common for the price of gold to be lower than the international stock market price paid in the main cities of the state or in cities with easier access, such as those along the BR-163 highway. In the context of the pandemic crisis, this reduction increased. In Lourenço, for example, garimpeiros had only two options to sell their gold, one at the local gold shop and one at the gold retailer in the capital of the state at nearly 400 km distance for a slightly higher price. Due to mobility restriction measures, garimpeiros do not have the latter alternative anymore and they can only sell their gold in the local shop. This practice reinforces the vulnerable position of garimpeiros that rely on gold mining for their everyday subsistence.Many garimpeiros believe that gold buyers are taking advantage of the pandemic to increase their profit. Indeed, this is a widespread perception around the world: the fatal combination of increased gold prices, supply chain limitations and lack of cash has widened the difference between local and global gold prices. Geenen and Verbrugge (2020) report that in Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone and Peru, this difference reaches 40% and in parts of the Philippines, it is over 60%. In Brazil, according to our research participants, retailers are paying between 180 and 210 R$ / g [around 28-33 GBP] to the garimpeiros when the price of gold is 280 R$ / g [around 43 GBP 6 ] which is a difference of more than 35%%. According to one garimpeiro in Lourenço, most gold retailers are stalling and accumulating gold until prices rise further: ""most of gold retailers are paralyzing [the market]. We clearly perceive that they are taking advantage of the situation"".Although the pandemic has exposed pre-existing conflict such as between the garimpeiros and the gold buyers, it also has stimulated local collaborative response and revealed the positive power of collective actions of self-organization and cooperation. Far from being solely operational and administrative organizations, cooperatives and associations constitute a network that helps creating access to supports for garimpeiros. One of the local cooperatives in Peixoto de Azevedo started an emergency distribution program of food supplies to garimpeiros and their families, and an informative campaign ""Campanha de combate ao COVID-19"" to promote the adoption of health measures. According to some representatives of local cooperatives, in Lourenço, garimpeiros who are still actively working, asked the municipality to guarantee their safety. The municipality in collaboration with the local healthcare service, then started to perform health controls of all people in all vehicles at the entrance and exit of Lourenço. Moreover, from his own initiative, the owner of an underground mine established a protocol of disinfection at the control stop at the entrance of the mine. Such local networks connecting garimpeiros, through their cooperatives and associations, with the local public authorities, represent a crucial element for the survival of these communities. Unfortunately, despite the efforts and the commitment from the local community, the latest update from the garimpeiros, in early June, reports that COVID-19 is rapidly spreading in Lourenço.In this contribution, we took a little peek at the reception of COVID-19 in ASGM communities in the Brazilian Amazon. Mining communities generally have to make it without good health facilities. Self-organization then turns out to be a way of mobilizing the public authorities to provide services. The associations in the sector also function as an information channel and in some cases with food for members who have been left without income.The COVID-19 pandemic makes explicit inequalities that arise in ASGM. Pre-existing conflicts underpinned by these inequalities are being heightened with an accelerated speed and deepened intensity, highlighting how conflict is multilayered (Salman et al., 2018) . Conflicts in ASGM mainly regards social and economic fragility, high level of informal and illegal practices, precarious health and working conditions, and negative socio-environmental impacts (World Bank, 2019). The failure of the state to give support to the mining communities makes them even more vulnerable in the context of the pandemic.On the one side, the COVID-19 pandemic adds more challenges to an already precarious sector, that could lead these garimpeiros, often invisible to public policies, to positions of further social and economic vulnerability. On the other side, the pandemic highlights the capacity of garimpeiros to self-organize and navigate the difficulties by finding alternative solutions. As often occurs in situations of conflict, actors discover new organization and mobilization strategies to cope with periods of crisis, revealing the dynamics of cooperation embedded in these processes (Ferreira et al., 2007; Fisher et al., 2018) . Cooperatives and associations emerged to achieve the longed-for formalization and legalization of the ASGM activity. Today, in the context of COVID-19, they widen their role in helping local communities to face the pandemic.Strategies of self-organization and communication channels have the potential to provide experiences useful for conflict transformation processes in the post-crisis. Key actors are working to improve the performance of the miners''organizations in achieving their original goals, such as those related to the formalization process. We hope that the pandemic crisis, despite the awful death toll in Brazil, catalyzes this improvement. Conversely, the position of government Bolsonaro in relation to mining and conservation of the Amazon complicates the ability of mining actors to engage in these processes of transformation.Scholars agree that once the pandemic ""turbulence"" is passed, markets will no longer be the same and large-scale mining companies should start preparing for change (Bainton et al., 2020; Laing, 2020) . Others predict that relationships between extractive industries and local communities will undergo deep changes (Bernauer and Slowey, 2020) . Moreover, we suggest that a reassessment of the ASGM sector in the post-pandemic future requires futher investigation of new measures regarding employee healthcare, and, of course, environmental and social sustainability.None.",Brazil,first author,2020-09-03,9
0a19346e8df5fca663d57eb3800a1f387db56077,"Seroprevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in health workers of the Sanitary Region VIII, at province of Buenos Aires","At the end of 2019, the world witnessed the emergence of a new disease. A hospital from Wuhan, Hubei province, alerted the Chinese government about the occurrence of a number of strange cases of severe pneumonia which were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). The pathogen involved was identified as a novel outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). On January 30, the WHO declared the situation as a public health emergency of international concern and, on March 11, it was characterized as a pandemic 1 .COVID-19 pandemic, originated from infection of SARS-CoV-2, is significantly spreading around the world. Globally, on August 10, 2020, 19,718,030 cumulative cases and 728,013 deaths have been registered 2 . In Argentina, there were 253,868 confirmed cases and 4,785 deaths 3 .In this context, the situation of health care workers represents a topic of interest because they are in the first line of response and their exposure to the virus is high as well as their potential to spread the infection in the community. This type of workers faces unprecedented occupational risks of morbidity and mortality [4] [5] [6] [7] which makes the timely implementation of protective measures imperative for this group [8] [9] [10] .Health care workers are all those who provide health care services or whose job is to provide care services and who directly cooperate in assistance positions. This includes workers who are in charge of direct sick patient assistance (medical doctors, nurses, laboratory technicians, dentists, administrative workers, etc.) as well as those who are in charge of food, cleaning, maintenance and security services 9 . As of June 29, 2020, 9% (N=2,761) of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Buenos Aires province involved health care workers 11 .The vast majority of the information available during the pandemic comes from passive epidemiological surveillance systems based on confirmation of suspected cases who have developed symptoms compatible with COVID-19. In this regard, the proportion of symptomatic infected individuals is mainly determined by RT-PCR from samples taken in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs.In harmony with the WHO recommendations regarding the implementation of early response to the pandemic by means serological studies 15 , Buenos Aires province set up an active epidemiological surveillance strategy which includes the serological monitoring of health care workers. Within this framework, a seroprevalence study which started with a pilot test in public hospitals of the Sanitary Region (RS, by its acronym in Spanish) VIII of the province was carried out.The purpose was to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 infection seroprevalence on health care workers of the RS VIII public subsector in Buenos Aires province during June, 2020.In order to calculate the sample size, the population considered was the total number of workers from each facility. Regarding the proportion expected, the situation demanding the largest sample size was take into consideration (50%) With a confidence level of 95%, precision of 5% and design effect of 2, a sample size of 736 was obtained, but expanded to 1,000 participants in anticipation to a non-response rate possibility.Two strata were considered: I) interregional hospitals (2 facilities) II) regional, subregional, municipal, local hospitals and health care units with inpatient care (23 facilities). The sample was proportionately distributed among the strata according to their size. All units from stratum I were included. The workers were selected using simple random sampling in each unit. In stratum II, the sampling was carried out using two-stage cluster sampling; 50% of the units were selected using probabilities proportionate to their size. The sample was distributed between them with a fixed fraction for all clusters (15%). In this last stage, the allocation of subjects to the sampling was made on the basis of the workers list provided by the selected facilities. The order number was assigned to the corresponding worker according to their position on the list ranked alphabetically.All workers who signed an informed consent were included. Participants with contraindications for phlebotomy were excluded.Data collection was carried out by means of a self-administered paper questionnaire with three sections: health care worker identification (ID), symptoms history, and clinical history.Previously validated questions were included, they were taken from the COVID-19In case isotype IgG antibodies were detected, IgM would be determined using the COVIDAR IgM test (ANMAT PM 1545-5). If IgM was detected, the collection of a nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab sample was indicated on the worker so as to rule out viral activity using RT-PCR. In such situation, the worker would be isolated and close contacts would be actively traced.A database was formulated using Epi Info TM (version 7) in order to upload the questionnaires and serological results. Fieldwork took place between June 3 and July 6, 2020. The questionnaires and the informed consents were sent in enclosed envelops and distributed in each facility on the vehicles used to transport the samples used in RS VIII. A previously designated representative from each hospital was in charge of inviting the selected workers, informing them about the study objectives, and organizing the assignment of data collection.Regarding the history of symptoms from the beginning of ASPO, headache was the most frequent (19.44%, n=147), followed by runny nose 10.49 % (n=76), less than 1% of the workers had fever (Table 3) . High blood pressure was the most frequent comorbidity on 11.65% of the workers (n=86);The SARS-CoV-2 infection seroprevalence of health care workers in public hospitals with inpatient care whether it be general or specialized in maternal and child care of the RS VIII was 0.75% (CI: 0-8.13; standard error: 3.76). As per the strata, prevalence was 0.62% for interregional hospitals (CI: 0-9.82) and 0.82% (CI: 0-9.28) for regional, municipal, and local.To the best of our knowledge, this was the first seroepidemiological study on health care workers carried out in Argentina during the COVID-19 pandemic with health care workers from the public subsector in the first line of response to the infection.In various countries around the world, the results of seroprevalence studies carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic on health care workers were dissimilar and inconsistent depending on the sampling strategy applied. It is interesting, however, that countries that experienced a rapid contagion curve with epidemics that collapsed the response capacity of the health care system have found relatively low prevalence results.Besides, it is well-known that the use of PPE lowers the infection risks health care workers are exposed to [26] [27] . In our study, a quarter of the workers informed not to have used it all the time. Such ratio should draw attention to the need to review the availability of PPE, training on its correct use, and investigation on aspects related to adherence to use.Another worth-mentioning aspect is multiple occupations of the health care workers which may be associated to a work overload. Not an insignificant percentage informed they worked at another facility besides the facility selected for the study. Previous investigations to this pandemic highlighted the work overload as an infection risk factor on health care workers 28 .In addition, this matter should be considered at the moment of planning epidemiological surveillance and outbreak studies during the pandemic because of the possibility of spreading the infection on diverse health centers if proper use of PPE is not reinforced.Even though the number of workers on whom antibodies were detected was low (five), two of them were asymptomatic. These findings, as well as the findings from other studies [29] [30] reinforce the need to harmonize passive epidemiological surveillance with serological surveillance on health care workers which may contribute to monitor the transmission dynamics and to evaluate infection control measures.Regarding the weaknesses, the small amount of cases found did not allow to carry out an infection risk analysis according to different characteristics of the health care workers such as occupation or comorbidity history. The fieldwork done in order to obtain the required data for the sampling frame implied a great effort on the part of the research team since the information available was not integrated in only one database and had to be developed. In this regard, we highlight the need to improve the health care information systems in Argentina to allow for the possibility to access appropriate records.This investigation constitutes a baseline of the dimension of infection on health care workers in an area of Argentina with low viral transmission at the moment this work was carried out.The findings reinforce the importance of including this type of studies in the framework of active epidemiological surveillance strategies on vulnerable populations in order to monitor the infection tendency and the percentage of susceptible individuals.",Argentina,first author,2020-09-09,9
b04fba571cf1457a72053ded3bb03185406c0c51,Temporal analysis of the clinical evolution of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the 1 state of Mato Grosso do Sul -Brazil 2 3,"observational study with a cross-sectional and time series design based on data from the 23 information system of the State Department of Health of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. 24The transmission of respiratory pathogens, such as the coronavirus, depends on their 72 being transported by secretions transmitted between people in the form of aerosols, 73 droplets, or secretions, or by direct contact with mucosa 1,9 . 74The mortality rate for COVID-19 has still not been clearly determined, since it is 75 rising in most countries. However, it has already been proven that people with 76 comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers and 77immunosuppression, in addition to older people, are at greater risk. The contagion rate 78 seems to vary among countries, which may be directly related to local health responses 79 for social isolation and care of the affected population 10 . 80The rapid dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic are a challenge and source of 81 concern for healthcare systems in different locations, especially emerging countries 82 such as Brazil, because fragile social and economic contexts may lead to underreporting 83 and make adequate management of the pandemic more difficult, which increases 84 uncertainties as to the dynamics of the disease 11 . 85Despite the implementation of measures and strategies to reduce the transmission 86 of COVID-19, the number of cases is expected to rise in all the Brazilian states. There is 87 a concern about the availability of intensive care unit beds and ventilator support for 88 hospitalized patients, in addition to specific diagnostic tests in sufficient amounts to 89 monitor the development of the disease 12 . 90The data was initially presented through descriptive statistics, absolute values, 122 percentage, and mean, minimum and maximum values, according to the type of 123 variable. Association tests were then performed using the chi-square or Fisher's exact 124 test and the Student's t-test for comparison of means. Following this, the risk 125 measurement and crude prevalence ratio were estimated, through univariate Poisson 126 modeling, to assess the magnitude of the risk of death based on the characteristics of the 127 study. 128Last, the Poisson multiple regression model to verify the factors related to the 129 prevalence of death among patients with COVID-19 was adjusted. In this model, the 130 possible confounding variables were determined and possible interactions were tested 131 (respiratory difficulties, pulmonary problems, sex and race). 132In addition, the presence of one and, mainly, two or more comorbidities were 240 independent risk factors for death, similar to that observed in the international context 241 of the pandemic 15-17 242Among the comorbidities found, pulmonary disease and diabetes had an 243 association with the occurrence of deaths, which is consistent with increased risk of 244 mortality in patients with these comorbidities observed in other studies 17, 18 . 245There was a higher number of deaths among men, even though the incidence of 246 cases was higher among women. Studies conducted during this pandemic and in other 247 SARS pandemics have also indicated more serious evolution of the disease among men 248 and associations with more deaths among these cases 18,19. The higher fatality rate noted 249 among the brown race was also confirmed in Brazil's North region, where this rate was 250 found to be higher among brown and black individuals, which may be related to 251 differences in susceptibility to COVID-19 and access to adequate health care by this 252 segment of the population 20,21 . 253The signs and symptoms manifested by patients, such as fever and respiratory 254 difficulties, were associated with higher mortality. The clinical manifestations of 255 COVID-19 appear to vary from region to region 22 , although the most frequent ones in 256 symptomatic patients have been found to be fever and fatigue, and the most common 257 complications have been pneumonia and respiratory insufficiency 23,24 . 258The higher distribution of the disease in the macro-region of Dourados may be due 259 to population density, as well as the extensive territory of the region's main city, which 260 often results in the need to commute by public transportation, and the presence of work 261 locations with large numbers of people on production lines, such as meatpacking plants 262The trend in relation to COVID-19 is growing and regular throughout the state of 298Mato Grosso do Sul, rising significantly after EW 20. This suggests that the state is far 299 from flattening the curve, which has manifested exponential, substantial and alarming 300 growth. 301",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-23,9

ATV bound more spontaneously because of its hydrogen bonds with Mpro, whereas LPV depends on hydrophobic interactions (Fig. S2) .Molecular dynamics analysis revealed that the root mean square deviation (RMSD) for the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro backbone presented different conformations in complex with ATV or LPV (see Fig. S3 ). LPV was initially at a 3.8-Å distance from the catalytic residue Cys145 (see Fig. S4A and S5A). After conformational changes, LPV was 7.17 Å distant from the active site ( Fig. 1A and C) , likely limiting its antiviral activity. Another critical residue, His41, was satisfactorily at a distance of 2.89 Å from bound LPV ( Fig. 1A and C). ATV interacted with neither His41 nor Cys145 at initial analysis ( Fig. S4B and S5B) . Nevertheless, ATV's position remained stable within the active site independently of conformational changes ( Fig. 1B and D) . The steric occupation of the cleft in the enzymatic active site by ATV, which blocks the residues of the catalytic amino acids, can be explained by its stronger interactions with Mpro than LPV (Tables S1 to S3). ATV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzymatic activity. Next, we evaluated whether ATV could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro activity by partially purifying the enzyme in cellular fractions obtained from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and performing zymographic profiles. To ensure that the proteinase profiles were not dependent on cellular enzymes, similar fractions of mock-infected cells were also prepared. The results from cysteine proteinase zymographic profiles in gelatinolytic gels reveled a cellular-related band of approximately 70 kDa under both conditions (Fig. 2 , Nil lanes). This activity was blocked by the drug E-64, an epoxide that acts as an irreversible inhibitor of cysteine proteases (Fig. 2 , E-64 lanes). In the infected cells, a region of activity was observed between 31 and 38 kDa that was not present in the mock fraction (Fig. 2 ). This zone of molecular weight is consistent with the expected size of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The enzyme activity was inhibited by exposure of the gels to 10 M ATV, without affecting cellular cysteine proteinase (Fig. 2 , ATV lanes). As a control, the activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in fractions from infected cells was evaluated by treatment with RTV, which inhibited activity in the molecular range of 31 to 38 kDa without a change in the 70-kDa region (Fig. 2 , RTV lanes). These data are consistent with predictions from the molecular modeling and dynamics that ATV targets SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to ATV and ATV/RTV in different cell types. We extended our investigation to evaluate the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to ATV in different cellular systems. Vero cells are a well-known model to produce high virus titers. ATV alone or in combination with RTV decreased infectious virus production and RNA levels in this cell line ( Fig. 3A and B, respectively). ATV/RTV was more potent than ATV, with 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) values of 0.5 Ϯ 0.08 M and 2.0 Ϯ 0.12 M, respectively (Fig. 3B) . Positive controls CQ, LPV/RTV, and remdesivir displayed potencies of 1.0 Ϯ 0.07 M, 5.3 Ϯ 0.5 M, and 0.5 Ϯ 0.08 M, respectively (Fig. 3B ). Our positive controls are consistent with results in the literature (21) , validating our analysis. The ATV/RTV, ATV, CQ, LPV/RTV, and remdesivir values for 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) were 280 Ϯ 3 M, 312 Ϯ 8 M, 259 Ϯ 5 M, 91 Ϯ 3 M, and 512 Ϯ 30 M, respectively. Our results indicate that the selectivity index (SI; which represents the ratio between the CC 50 and EC 50 values) for ATV/RTV, ATV, CQ, LPV/RTV, and remdesivir were 560, 156, 259, 18, and 1,020, respectively, which shows that ATV/RTV and ATV have therapeutic potential above that of CQ and LPV/RTV, compounds that advanced toward clinical trials early after the pandemic outbreak. Since the results regarding the pharmacologic activity of ATV and ATV/RTV against SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells were promising, we next investigated whether the proposed drug therapies could inhibit virus replication in a human epithelial pulmonary cell line (A549). ATV alone showed a nearly 10-fold increase in potency for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in A549 cells (Fig. 3C ) compared to that in Vero cells (Fig. 3B ). ATV/RTV and CQ were similarly potent in inhibiting virus replication in both cell types ( Fig. 3B and C) . Drugs repurposed in this study, ATV and ATV/RTV, were more potent than positive controls in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in A549 cells. Potencies for ATV/RTV, ATV, CQ, LPV/RTV, and remdesivir were 0.60 Ϯ 0.05 M, 0.22 Ϯ 0.02 M, 0.89 Ϯ 0.02 M, 0.9 Ϯ 0.5 M, and 0.6 Ϯ 0.02 M, respectively. In vitro results confirmed the rationale that SARS-CoV-2 would be susceptible to ATV, including in cells derived from the respiratory tract.ATV and ATV/RTV prevent cell death and proinflammatory cytokine production in SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes. Severe COVID-19 has been associated with levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and leukopenia (22) . Viral infection in the respiratory tract often triggers the migration of blood monocytes to FIG 3 The antiviral activity of ATV and ATV/RTV against SARS-CoV-2. Vero (A and B) or A549 (C) cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01 and exposed to the indicated concentrations of atazanavir (ATV), atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/RTV; 3:1), chloroquine (CQ), remdesivir (RDV), or lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV; 4:1). After 2 days, viral replication in the culture supernatant was measured by TCID 50 /ml (A) or RT-PCR (B and C). The data represent means Ϯ standard errors of the means (SEMs) from three independent experiments.Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy orchestrate the transition from innate to adaptive immune responses (23) . For these reasons, ATV and ATV/RTV were tested at suboptimal (1 M) and optimal (10 M) doses, with respect to their in vitro pharmacological parameters against SARS-CoV-2. ATV/RTV, CQ, and remdesivir were similarly efficient at reducing the amount viral genome equivalent in the human monocytes (Fig. 4A ). Virus infection increased cellular mortality by 75%, which was prevented by ATV, ATV/RTV, and remdesivir (Fig. 4B ). LPV/RTV was inefficient at reducing viral RNA levels and cell death ( Fig. 4A and B) . Moreover, we observed that infections by SARS-CoV-2 triggered the expected increase in the IL-6 levels in the culture supernatant, which ranged from 20-to 60-fold depending on the cell donor (Fig. 4C) . The virus-induced enhancement of IL-6 levels was significantly prevented by treatment with ATV, ATV/RTV, and CQ (Fig. 4C ). Another biomarker of uncontrolled proinflammatory cytokine response, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-␣), was upregulated 40-fold during virus infection (Fig. 4D) . ATV, ATV/RTV, and remdesivir (10 M) significantly prevented the induction of TNF-␣ release (Fig. 4D ). Altogether, our results confirm that ATV and ATV/RTV should not be ignored as an additional therapeutic option against COVID-19. In these 2 decades of the 21st century, the human vulnerability to emerging viral diseases has been notable (24) . The emergence of infectious disease highlights the undeniable fact that existing countermeasures are inefficient at preventing virus spillover and disease outbreaks. Preclinical data on the susceptibility of an emerging virus to clinically approved drugs can allow for the rapid mobilization of resources toward clinical trials (8) . This approach proved feasible for combating the Zika, yellow fever, and chikungunya outbreaks experienced in Brazil over the past 5 years, when our group demonstrated that sofosbuvir, a blockbuster drug against hepatitis C, could represent a compassionate countermeasure against these diseases (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) .Currently, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 dissemination has become one of the most rapidly evolving pandemics known in modern times, with the number of cases and deaths doubling every week, and the peak of the pandemic has yet to arrive in some territories (6) . The existence of several ongoing clinical trials against COVID-19 reinforces the suggestion that drug repurposing represents the fastest approach to identify therapies to emerging infectious disease (8) .Among therapies initially included in the Solidarity trial, the most interesting results come from remdesivir, whereas CQ and LPV/RTV showed limited clinical benefit (9) . LPV/RTV reduced mortality in critically ill patients by 5% (11) . On the other hand, this therapy showed no clinical benefit in a large clinical trial (30) . Although the combination therapy with protease (LPV/RTV) and RNA polymerase (ribavirin) inhibitors and immunomodulators (IFN-␤) reduced the viral loads in COVID-19 patients (31), these drugs seem to be impractical for early treatment because of IFN's price-safety profile. The history of antiretroviral research teaches us that combinations are necessary. Positive laboratory and clinical results with RNA polymerase inhibitors, such as remdesivir, ribavirin, and favipiravir (21, 31, 32) , against SARS-CoV-2 suggest they could be more effective if combined with active protease inhibitors. We highlight ATV and ATV/RTV because our assay readout to quantify infectious virus particles reveals (i) a good profile of antiviral activity, (ii) higher potencies in respiratory cells, and (iii) the ability to reduce levels of proinflammation mediator in monocytes.We believe that early repurposing of LPV/RTV for COVID-19 was based on previous evidence during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 and again for MERS-CoV (33) . Information on the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to other antiviral protease inhibitors approved since 2003, such as ATV, has been scarce. Since this year, ATV has become a wider prescribed drug among HIV-infected individuals than LPV, including for critically ill patients (17) . ATV shows a safer profile than LPV in both short-and long-term therapeutic regimens (16, 34) . ATV has a documented bioavailability to reach the respiratory tract (19, 35) , which led to its proposed use against pulmonary fibrosis (20) . Under our experimental conditions, ATV was superior to LPV/RTV, which may motivate further clinical trials.The potency of LPV/RTV against SARS-CoV-2 was lower than those of ATV and ATV/RTV. Nevertheless, remdesivir was more potent than ATV or ATV/RTV. The improved potency of ATV, in comparison to that of LPV, may be at least in part due to its multiple hydrogen bond-driven interactions within the Mpro active site. Other investigators have also recognized a wider range of interactions of ATV and Mpro compared to those with LPV (18, 36) , although none provided functional evidence through phenotypic assays as presented here. Neither ATV nor LPV displayed any interactions with the catalytic dyad of Cys145 and His41 at the start of the molecular dynamics simulations. However, important interactions were observed at the end, such as LPV-His41 and ATV-Glu166. Glu166 is one of the residues that promotes the opening of Mpro for its substrate to interact with the active site (37, 38) .Highly pathogenic respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus, have been associated with a cytokine storm, described as an uncontrolled proinflammatory cytokine response (39, 40) . Cytokine storms also seem to be highly relevant for pathogenic human CoVs (41) . Contemporary investigations on SARS-CoV-2 strongly suggest the involvement of cytokine storms in disease severity (22) . COVID-19 mortality is associated with enhanced IL-6 levels and consistent with cell death, as measured by LDH release (22) . We showed that ATV and ATV/RTV decreased IL-6 release in SARS-CoV-2infected human primary monocytes. Moreover, we also included in our analysis TNF-␣, another hallmark of inflammation during respiratory virus infections (22, 58) . Our results reveled that cellular mortality and cytokine storm-associated mediators were reduced after treatment with the repurposed antiretroviral drugs used in this study.As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic goes on and the Solidarity trials fail to demonstrate the benefit of LPV/RTV, preclinical data or clinically approved protease inhibitors, such as ATV-ATV/RTV, need to be catalogued. The higher potency of ATV-ATV/RTV over that of LPV/RTV is the contribution of our study to highlight a new option among clinically approved drugs that should be considered in ongoing clinical trials for an effective treatment for COVID-19.Reagents. The antivirals ATV, ATV/RTV, and CQ were received as donations from Instituto de Tecnologia de Fármacos (Farmanguinhos, Fiocruz). ATV/RTV was prepared daily in the proportion of 3:1 as pharmaceutical pills composed of 300 mg ATV and 100 mg RTV. Remdesivir and LPV/RTV (4:1 ratio) were purchased from Selleckchem (Houston, TX). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were purchased from R&D Bioscience. All small molecule inhibitors were dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and subsequently diluted at least 10 4 -fold in culture or reaction medium before each assay. The final DMSO concentrations showed no cytotoxicity. The materials for cell culture were purchased from Thermo Scientific Life Sciences (Grand Island, NY), unless otherwise mentioned. Cells and virus. African green monkey kidney (Vero, subtype E6) and A549 (human lung epithelial cells) cells were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, UT) and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin (pen/strep; Thermo Fisher) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 .Human primary monocytes were obtained after 3 h of plastic adherence of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs were isolated from healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque; GE Healthcare). PBMCs (2.0 ϫ 10 6 cells) were plated on 48-well plates (Nalge Nunc) in RPMI 1640 without serum for 2 to 4 h. Nonadherent cells were removed, and the remaining monocytes were maintained in DMEM with 5% human serum (HS; Millipore) and penicillin/streptomycin. The purity of human monocytes was Ͼ95% as determined by flow cytometric analysis (FACScan; Becton, Dickinson) using anti-CD3 (BD Biosciences) and anti-CD16 (Southern Biotech) monoclonal antibodies.SARS-CoV-2 was prepared in Vero E6 cells from an isolate contained on a nasopharyngeal swab obtained from a confirmed case in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Viral experiments were performed after a single passage in a cell culture in a 150-cm 2 flask with DMEM plus 2% FBS. Observations for cytopathic effects were performed daily, which peaked 4 to 5 days after infection. All procedures related to virus culture were handled in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) multiuser facility according to WHO guidelines. Virus titers were determined as the tissue culture infectious dose at 50% (TCID 50 /ml). Virus stocks were kept in Ϫ80°C ultralow freezers. The virus strain was sequenced to confirm the virus identity.Cytotoxicity assay. Monolayers of 1.5 ϫ 10 4 Vero cells in 96-well plates were treated for 3 days with various concentrations (semilog dilutions from 600 to 10 M) of ATV, ATV/RTV, or CQ. Then, 5 mg/ml 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) in DMEM was added to the cells in the presence of 0.01% of N-methyl dibenzopyrazine methyl sulfate (PMS). After incubating for 4 h at 37°C, the plates were measured in a spectrophotometer at 492 nm and 620 nm. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) was calculated by a nonlinear regression analysis of the dose-response curves.Yield reduction assay. Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Vero or A549 cells were infected at densities of 5 ϫ 10 5 cells/well. Human primary monocytes were infected at a density of 2 ϫ 10 5 to 8 ϫ 10 5 cells/well, depending on the endogenous characteristic of the cell donor. Infections were performed in 48-well plates for 2 h at 37°C. The cells were washed, and various concentrations of compounds were added to DMEM with 2% FBS. After 48 h, virus in the supernatants was quantified by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and/or by TCID 50 /ml. A variable slope nonlinear regression analysis of the dose-response curves was performed to calculate the concentration at which each drug inhibited virus production by 50% (EC 50 ).Virus titration. Monolayers of Vero cells (2 ϫ 10 4 cell/well) in 96-well plates were infected with a log-based dilution of supernatants containing SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were washed, fresh medium was added with 2% FBS, and 3 to 5 days postinfection, the cytopathic effect was scored in at Fintelman-Rodrigues et al.Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy least 10 replicates per dilution by independent readers. The reader was blind with respect to source of the supernatant. A Reed and Muench scoring method was employed to determine TCID 50 /ml (42) . Molecular detection of virus RNA levels. The total RNA from the culture supernatants was extracted using a QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using a QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) in an ABI PRISM 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Amplifications were carried out in 25-l reaction mixtures containing 2ϫ reaction mix buffer, 50 M each primer, 10 M probe, and 5 l of RNA template. Primers, probes, and cycling conditions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 (43) . The standard curve method was employed for virus quantification. For reference to the cell amounts used, the housekeeping gene RNase P was amplified. The threshold cycle (C T ) values for this target were compared to those obtained for different cell amounts, 10 7 to 10 2 , for calibration.Measurements of inflammatory mediators and cell death marker. The levels of TNF-␣, IL-6, and LDH were quantified in the monocyte supernatants from infected and uninfected cells. ELISAs for TNF-␣ and IL-6 required 100 l of supernatants to be exposed to capture antibody in 96-well plates. After a 2-h incubation period at room temperature (RT), the detection antibody was added. Plates were incubated for another 2 h at RT. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and its substrate were added and incubated for 20 min, and the optical density was determined using a microplate reader set to 450 nm.Extracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was quantified using a Doles kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Supernatant was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 1 min to remove cellular debris. A total of 25 l of supernatant was placed into 96-well plates and incubated with 5 l of ferric alum and 100 l of LDH substrate for 3 min at 37°C. NAD (oxidized form) was added before the addition of a stabilizing solution. After a 10-min incubation, plates were measured in a spectrophotometer at 492 nm.Molecular docking. ATV (PubChem CID 148192) and LPV (PubChem CID 92727) were used as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. ATV and LPV were prepared using a generalized amber force field (GAFF), and their charges were obtained using the AM1-BCC loading scheme (44, 45) .Molecular docking experiments were performed with DOCK 6.9 (46) to identify the binding site of Mpro. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure was obtained from Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB; http://www .rcsb.org) under the accession code 6LU7 (47) . The active site region was identified by using a complexed peptide {N-[(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl]alanyl-L-valyl-nϳ1ϳ-[(1r,2z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-{[(3r)-2oxopyrrolidin-3-yl]methyl}but-2-enyl]-L-leucinamide} as a guide. The creation of the DOCK 6.9 input files for docking was performed using Chimera 1.14 (48) .The docking of ligands was performed in a box of 10-Å edges with its mass center matching that of the complexed peptide. Each scan produced 20 conformations for each ligand, with the best score being used for molecular dynamics simulations.Molecular dynamics. Since the tertiary structure (3D) of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is a homodimer, we focused the molecular dynamics on only one chain, chain A. Molecular dynamics calculations were performed using NAMD 2.9 (49) and Charmm27* force field (50) at pH 7, i.e., with deprotonated Glu and Asp, protonated Arg and Lys, and neutral His with a protonated N atom. This all-atom force field has been able to fold properly many soluble proteins (51) (52) (53) . The soluble proteins were centered in a cubic box of transferable intermolecular potential with 3 points (TIP3P) water molecules (54); the box extended 1.2 nm outside the protein on its four lateral sides, and the appropriate numbers of Na ϩ and Cl Ϫ ions were added to ensure system neutralization. The electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method and a cutoff of 1.2 nm (55). The same cutoff of 1.2 nm was used for the Van der Waals interactions. The nonbonded pair lists were updated every 10 fs. The analysis was based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of 100 ns at 310 K.Protein extraction. Protein extracts containing SARS-CoV-2 Mpro activity were obtained from Vero cell monolayers on 25-cm 2 flasks that were infected for 1 h at an MOI of 0.1 at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . After 1 or 2 days of infection, the supernatant was harvested, and monolayers were washed 3 times with in sterile cold PBS (pH 7.2). Next, cells were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.6% Triton X-100) and kept at 4°C. The soluble protein fraction was isolated as the supernatant after centrifugation (100,000 ϫ g, 30 min, 4°C) and stored at Ϫ20°C until further use. The protein concentrations of the samples were determined using the BCA protein assay kit.Zymographic assays. Proteinases were assayed after electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gels with 0.1% copolymerized gelatin (56) . Briefly, each of the gel slots was loaded with 12 g of soluble proteins dissolved in Laemmli's buffer, and following electrophoresis at a constant voltage of 200 V at 4°C, they were soaked for 1 h at 25°C in washing buffer (0.1 mM sodium acetate buffer [pH 5.5] containing 2.5% TX-100). Proteinase activity was detected by incubating (16 h at 37°C) the gels in reaction buffer (0.1 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.5 containing 1.0 mM DTT), in the presence or absence of the same concentrations of 10 M E-64, ATV, RTV, or the ATV/RTV combination. Hydrolysis of gelatin was visualized by staining the gels with 0.2% amido black (57) .Statistical analysis. The assays were performed blinded by one professional, codified, and then read by another professional. All experiments were carried out at least three independent times, including a minimum of two technical replicates in each assay. The dose-response curves used to calculate EC 50 and CC 50 values were generated by variable slope plot from Prism GraphPad software 8.0. The equations to fit the best curve were generated based on R 2 values of Ն0.9. Student's t test was used to assess statistical significance at P values of Ͻ0.05. The statistical analyses specific to each software program used in the bioinformatics analysis are described above.Data availability.

d4cb7f667c235679eec8d56df5b98d42ed8dc2d1,The Influence of Telemedicine Care on the Management of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms in Dementia (BPSD) Risk Factors Induced or Exacerbated During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Dementia, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition, is a neurocognitive disorder defined as a chronic and gradually developing decline of cognitive functions that results in occupational and social dysfunctions (1) . The number of people with dementia worldwide is expected to increase to approximately 1.3 billion in 2050 (2, 3) . Even if cognitive symptoms are commonly considered the hallmark feature of dementia, patients usually present a wide variety of ""non-cognitive"" neuropsychiatric symptoms, and they are important disease manifestations (4, 5) . They are termed behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and represent a heterogeneous group of non-cognitive symptoms related to disturbed perception, thought content, mood, and behavior.Throughout the course of the dementia process, the vast majority of patients will develop one or more of these symptoms, which can include agitation, motor disturbance, anxiety, irritability, depression, apathy, disinhibition, hallucinations, delusions, and sleep or appetite disturbances (6) (7) (8) (9) , and their prevalence may increase from mild to severe dementia (10) . Almost 90% of patients suffer from dementia (11) , although the etiology and management of dementia are still a challenge, and dementia can be responsible for increased referrals to nursing homes and prolonged periods of hospitalization (12) .A preliminary study rated BPSD in 124 patients with Alzheimer's disease and found that the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in this population was higher for apathy (51%), dysphoria (50%), and irritability (38%) (11) , while another study with 408 patients evaluating a 5-year period prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia found that this was greatest for depression (77%), apathy (71%), and anxiety (62%) (13) . The progression of the severity of dementia increases the likelihood of hallucinations while decreasing the odds of depression, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, compared to other dementias, are less likely to present agitation, disinhibition, and depression (14) .Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, a newly emergent coronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 (15) and declared a pandemic in March 2020 (16) . Recently, the world imposition of social distance and selfisolation as the best preventive measures for COVID-19 has created challenges in health care and management, especially for elderly people (17) . In this context, telemedicine, a remote medical practice using telecommunication and information technologies, appeared to be a viable alternative to face-to-face consultations (18) .In this article, we aim to discuss the worsening of BPSD in elderly people with dementia during the pandemic and defend how telemedicine can be an important alternative for the current context.After the outbreak of COVID-19, the increase in the amount of information about the disease and concerns about its implications are impacting global mental health (19) . The increase in the number of suspected cases and confirmed patients spread the public worry of being infected. The uncertain future of the pandemic has been exacerbated by the excess of information, sometimes driven by erroneous news reports (20) . Sick patients may experience fear of an uncertain prognosis due to the fatal potential of the virus. On the other hand, the general population, especially those who are experiencing quarantine, can feel boredom, loneliness, and anger (21) . This situation can be stressful for all people, provoking fear and anxiety about the disease and causing strong emotions in children and adults (22) .In fact, these changes and the fear of the unknown lead to increased psychiatry symptoms in both healthy people and those with pre-existing mental health problems (19) . The stress associated with COVID-19 increases the chances of patients with pre-existing mental disorders to relapse or have new episodes. Therefore, it is important to find a balance between distance and social isolation since the loneliness imposed by quarantine can cause harmful psychological effects, especially for the elderly (23) .Elderly people can experience these feelings more intensely. They already have special physical, psychosocial, and environmental vulnerabilities associated with age (24) . Case fatality in individuals 65 years or above is higher than that in other populations (25) . Their frailty brings the risk of various infections and decreases the immune response; they have more comorbidities and more hospitalizations, increasing the chance of being infected with COVID-19 (26) . Knowledge about this vulnerability can increase the effect of the uncertainty and fear of the pandemic, and they may experience the fear of their own death and of losing their loved ones (24) .The known limitations of the elderly in dealing with technology gadgets and sensory and cognitive deficits may make it difficult for them to access updated information about COVID-19 situations, making them victims of misinformation and inadequate precautionary measures to follow (24) . Furthermore, self-isolation as a preventive measure can severely affect the elderly whose only social contact is out of home; those who do not have the support of their families or friends and depend on the social support of volunteers or social care could be in additional risk situations, along with those who live alone or isolated (27) . Social distancing can be an independent risk factor for depression, anxiety and suicide, especially in places such as nursing care or old-age homes (28) . Studies have observed that under these stress factors, the level of anxiety among nursing homes and caregivers increased, and they developed signs of exhaustion and burnout after a month of full lockdown (17) .Beyond age, patients with dementia are more susceptible to morbidity and mortality of the virus because they have more cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and pneumonia compared to the elderly without dementia (29) . Other features may increase the risk of contracting COVID-19, such as the difficulties of this population to follow the recommendations from public health to prevent the transmission: correct hand hygiene, maintain physical distance, monitor and report symptoms of the disease and self-isolation by remaining alone at home (15) .In addition to social isolation, elderly people infected with COVID-19 could have experienced other consequences, including hospitalization and behavioral problems. One of the main symptoms of the disease is dyspnea, and the hypoxia generated by COVID-19 can cause delirium, which may complicate the course of dementia, increasing the suffering of the patients and their caregivers, the cost of medical care, and the need for support (17) .Increased demand in the health care system can hinder the access of patients with chronic diseases, such as dementia, to the services, and the fear of being infected during the use of health care settings can impair outpatient follow-up and the use of emergency services if necessary. The workup, diagnosis and clinical follow-up of these patients can be harmed by deviation of resources and professionals to act in combat of pandemic, and those living alone in community may feel loneliness due the social isolation and absence of their group activities (28) .BPSD causes and risk factors are multiple and complex. Factors that contribute to the occurrence of these symptoms can be categorized as follows: factors related to the patient (neurobiological changes-brain lesions and type of dementia, changes in neurotransmission and neuromodulation, acute medical illnessurinary tract infection, pneumonia, dehydration, constipation, unmet needs-pain, sleep problems, fear, pre-existing personality and psychiatric illness); caregiver factors (stress, burden, depression, lack of education about the disease, communication issues) and environmental factors (safety issues, overstimulation or under stimulation, lack of structure or lack of established routines) (8, 9) .BPSD is not well diagnosed, and the treatment is poorly understood. Deciding which aspects constitute a behavioral disorder is extremely subjective and is associated with worse cognition, more severe stages of dementia, high levels of distress both in patients and their caregivers (family members or health professionals), long-term hospitalization, misuse of medications and increased health care costs (6) .Neuropsychiatric manifestations could be divided into three different groups according to the main symptoms presented: affective syndrome, psychological syndrome, and other neuropsychiatric disorders (30) . Some studies reveal that there are differences between the occurrences of BPSD over time. In general, hyperactivity and apathy have high persistence and incidence, depression and anxiety have moderate incidence, low or moderate persistence, and psychotic symptoms are less prevalent with a moderate or low incidence (10) . This is important for the identification and proper approach by the doctor and caregivers.The initial management of BPSD is to identify and quantify the symptoms to evaluate the possibility of being secondary to comorbidities such as infection, dehydration, metabolic decompensation, adverse drug effects, and others. Proper treatment of these comorbidities alone can mitigate BPSD. If those are not the causes, non-pharmacological measures have to be instituted. Under normal conditions, environmental adaptations or modifications, the establishment of a specific routine, guidance for caregivers and family members and programs for physical activity, music and light therapy are good strategies for dealing with these symptoms (30) . Some of these can be harmed during the pandemic, which can become a problem for non-pharmacologic management of these conditions.In the actual context, several risk factors (social isolation; pharmacology adherence; caregivers' burden; reduction of nonpharmacologic strategies; lack of medical evaluation; modification of house routine) can arise to trigger or exacerbate BPSD. Elderly people, especially those who are isolated and with cognitive decline or dementia, can become more anxious, irritated, stressed, agitated, and withdrawn during quarantine. Most of the caregivers are not prepared to deal with BPSD, requiring guidance on where and how to get practical help and regular medications.Telemedicine is defined as a tool to provide healthcare at a distance through the use of telecommunications technology (31) . The first reference to telemedicine was in 1897, informing the use of telephone calls instead of a personal doctor visit for a bedridden home patient (32) . Today, many people have telecommunication devices, such as smartphones, laptops and tablets that could be used as private real-time consultations (33) .Moreover, telemedicine is growing in popularity because of the COVID-19 pandemic context and social distance (34) . After all, in addition to social isolation, there are still restrictions on public transport, which also represents a major barrier to access medical care (35) . It is an alternative tool that could be more used and enable mental health professionals to keep improving health care during the outbreak (36, 37) . Additionally, the elderly are affected by health problems that need frequent monitoring, and telemedicine, by breaking geographical barriers and reducing unnecessary travel, facilitates access and management of all these factors by the caregivers, improving health care (38) .It is important to consider that most elderly people need a caregiver (professionals, family, friends) who must be supported by health services (23) and benefit from telemedicine. Caregivers have many responsibilities in caring for dementia patients, and the convenience and accessibility of telemedicine could help them manage psychosocial issues and even their own support, doubts and early interventions (31) .Therefore, telemedicine is well established in the literature as an alternative balance between social distance and the need for specialized consultation. It can imply cost reduction, relief of the health system, less exposure of the population at risk to infections, continuity of monitoring during the period of social distance and greater articulation between health services and patients/caregivers (31, 37, 39) .This system allows for easy access to a dementia specialist and can assist the patient in maintaining his clinical stability, as well as providing caregivers with sufficient guidance to deal with new symptoms that may appear during the pandemic, relieving stress caused by BPSD. Additionally, it expands access to clinical resources and links health care providers with patients and their caregivers, thereby overcoming the limitations of face-toface appointments. In addition, telemedicine may reduce hospitalization and emergency department visits (40) and implies higher rates of treatment continuation in dementia patients, which could suggest that telemedicine improves factors that can contribute to slowing the progression of dementia, resulting in better prognosis, reduced hospitalization and visits to urgency/emergency settings (37) .Although psychiatry evaluation is about what we see, nonverbal communication and what is not said (36) , mental health is still a specialty that can be well suited to telemedicine programs (31) . Studies show that telemedicine has a high level of satisfaction and effectiveness with low cost, is very convenient, and is easily accessible (41) . In addition, it provides clinical outcomes equivalent to face-to-face services (31, 37, 39) . Telemedicine is not just a replacement for face-to-face appointments; it holds the possibility of new avenues for care delivery, more frequent but shorter encounters, and opportunities for earlier intervention (41) to improve mental health.Studies have listed some problems with telemedicine, such as technically challenged staff (11%), resistance to change (8%), cost (8%), age of patient (5%), and level of education of patient (5%) (31) . Additionally, it is important to include visual and hearing problems of elderly people as a difficult factor in handling electronic devices, and we should provide appropriate adjustments to them (33) .There are many platforms to use, but for Brazil's public health reality, due to the low education and social level of our population (especially in our reality-University Hospital), WhatsApp is probably the most accessible mobile app. Even so, we still face some other problems related to infrastructure and population needs, such as: some of them have no smartphone to proceed a video call, poor internet connection, and the need of a caregiver to help with the telecommunication process.In those cases, we need to lay hands on a simple phone call, but we have been successful considering the pandemics' needs. This tool works well for established patients, or the one we already know, but for the first time, it could be insufficient (36) . For a complex or difficult case, we still proceed with a face-toface consultation, respecting the rules of individual protection.The COVID-19 pandemic has brought important structural and behavioral changes worldwide. For health systems, social distancing has imposed the need for new alternatives for medical care without exposing patients, especially risk groups such as the geriatric population, to possible infections. The elderly have more reason to suffer from this whole situation, both in relation to their biological risk of contracting the disease and to the more restricted social isolation. Those with dementia are at serious risk of losing their effective follow-up, adjusting medications and general orientations when non-pharmacological approaches should be adopted. In addition, the lack of routine and of the others outside therapeutic alternatives can worsen dementia symptoms, especially BPSD.There are a few reasons why BPSD can worsen during a pandemic, such as social isolation, caregiver stress, sleep disturbances, lack of medical follow-up with medication adjustments, changes in the house routine, risk of infections, and untreated clinical diseases. One of the most important points in the treatment of BPSD is non-nonpharmacological interventions, which involve social and physical contact, such as social and exercise groups. The social isolation imposed by the pandemic suspended these interventions and will also result in decreased social engagement and worse disease progression. It is necessary to create new alternative plans for these patients in this new situation ( Table 1) .In this context, telemedicine comes as a valid alternative to expand access to clinical resources and links health care providers with patients and their caregivers, thereby overcoming the limitations of face-to-face appointments and being a balance between social distance and the need for specialized consultation.In contrast to the results found from the latest Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) Health Tracking Poll (a survey project that provides consistent and up-to-date information on the public's opinions, knowledge and experiences with the U.S. healthcare 1. Public health information can be difficult to understand-Try to transmit the information in a clear and simple way, remembering how to properly do the hygiene measures as many times as necessary and helping the elderly to do it. Using memory aids like pictures or notes can assist in this task; encourage and celebrate the small achievements. 2. Keep in touch with family and friends through electronic devices so that the elderly do not feel so lonely. 3. Look for signs of impaired mental health (is he feeling more anxious? Sad?Confused)? and provide psychological support, encouraging them to talk about any feelings and look for professional help if it is necessary. 4. Changes in routine can be difficult and increase BPSD: try to maintain a routine as similar as before the pandemic, the activities you would usually do around the house and keep to regular meal and bedtimes. 5. Learn simple physical exercises to do at home with the elderly to maintain the mobility. Relaxation and mindfulness are good activities too. 6. Try to promote cognitive stimulation (listen to music, see family photos and try to remember who are in those, discuss special objects); stimulate light activities, like taking care of plants and animals. 7. Take care of a good sleep routine. 8. Create a week schedule and do the plans to maintain the routine. 9. Be sure of the amount of medications and groceries you have at home so that you are safe. 10. Look for the possibilities of medical assistance by telemedicine. Ask all the questions you have; ask for help to manage the symptoms at home and make sure there is enough medication at home. 11. Have easy access to all possible help channels: close family, taxis, phone number, supermarket, medical assistance. system), that seven out of 10 adults 65 and older (68%) say they have a computer, smartphone or tablet with Internet access at home, but only 11% of this population says they used one of these devices for a teleconsultation; in our services, we have achieved greater adherence to psychogeriatric telemedicine during this pandemic period. During the month of May 2020, we performed 34 teleconsultations through video (WhatsApp) or audio (phone call); 45 were scheduled, only five did not answer the contact, one patient died, two rescheduled because of first appearance in our service, two had wrong schedules, and one was not confirmed. In June and July, we made 43 and 58 consultations, respectively, and the vast majority of them were by teleconsultation. In the same period of last year (May, June and July, 2019), our psychogeriatric service had 51, 42, and 25 scheduled consultations, respectively, 42, 33, and 24 of which were made. The service flow of our service begins three or four days before the consultation day. Our nurse team has contact with the patient or a caregiver, telling him that he will receive a psychiatric teleconsultation and communicate our orientations for a good interaction (for example, the patient must be with a caregiver at home; they should be in a quiet room; test the connection). Initially, we had a poor adherence level, and this nurse contact was very important to increase it and decrease the time lost to explain these orientations during medical contact. Most of the patients or caregivers were open to this type of medical care and tried to make it work. Important prescription modifications have been made during these pandemic months, such as new depressive episodes, psychotic episodes, or the worsening of BPSD, which probably avoided more severe symptoms. When we have doubts about medical conduct, the patient was scheduled to receive an ambulatory consultation. Nevertheless, some of the caregivers had no compromise with the teleconsultation; by the time of scheduled communication, they were not with the patient. The application of scales for cognitive screening was another important difficulty, which became a limitation. Patients and caregivers had trouble understanding our instructions to download, answer, or perform some scale tasks.A recent survey study used a television-based telehealth service to support European adults living with mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment and found that those who are using this technology are doing more memory exercises and can help them with cognitive stimulation in this particular situation. Access to these devices may reduce feelings of isolation, and the creation of a specific telephone support line has been described as effective in providing health information and social support to this population (44) .Telemedicine might help reduce the risk for the development of negative mental health outcomes precipitated by a reduction in social contact and less access to health services, improving dementia symptom management, mainly BPSD, and mental care. In addition, it can help caregivers by providing more agile guidance on non-pharmacological measures to control symptoms adapted to the new reality of confinement. Additionally, it allows health support in real time, even at a distance, making possible adequate medication adjustment, when necessary, without exposing the patient and caregiver to risks of infection.The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material; further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.",Brazil,first author,2020-09-15,9

09d7df41dae0b875f305bae830e456280b5a6c70,The effect of COVID-19 on the economy: evidence from an early 1 adopter of localized lockdowns,"Our main empirical specification is a two-way fixed-effects model: 143where ∆%VATit corresponds to the percent variation of total VAT collected in municipality at month in 145 2020 relative to the same month in 2019.where standalonei takes a value of one for standalone municipalities and zero otherwise. 161The economic effects of localized lockdowns may also differ depending on the area under lockdown-for 163 example, at the municipality or conurbation level. To examine this question, we also ran our analysis 164 comparing all municipalities within a conurbation with standalone municipalities. We weighted the 165 number of days in quarantine in month of each municipality belonging to the conurbation according 166 to the total 2018 VAT: 167We estimated deaths and COVID-19 cases as a weighted average of deaths in municipalities within the 169 conurbation, using the municipality's population as the weight. Hence, the equation describing per capita 170 COVID deaths in each conurbation is as follows: 171Last, we investigate how mobility at the municipality-level affects economic activity. We used a mobility 173 index based on cellphone data. 174 175[24] found that a one-per-thousand increase in the infection rate was associated with an employment loss 307 of 2-3%. Extrapolating this result to the United States and the United Kingdom, which had large-scale 308 lockdowns, Aum et al. [24] argue that only half of the 5-6% drop in job losses in these Western 309 economies might be attributable to lockdowns. The rest would be from social panic, some other large-310 scale non-pharmaceutical intervention, such as school closures, or demand effects. This similar effect of 311 areas with and without lockdown seems consistent with our findings. Importantly, we obtained our results Our estimates have limitations. First, we used a tax payment as a proxy for economic activity. 340Nonetheless, we also have VAT and survey-based employment at the regional level in Chile. We found a 341 statistically significant elasticity of 0.3 between the drop in VAT and the decline in total employment 342 (including self-employed), consistent with short-run output-employment elasticities in the literature (34). 343Another limitation is that informal economic activity is, by its very nature, not directly captured in our 344 measures of VAT. This is a more general limitation globally. However, compared to Latin America, Chile 345 has relatively low informality [53] . 346We used a rich dataset of localized lockdowns in Chile to measure their effect on economic activity. We 355 find sizeable impacts of lockdowns, doubling the drop in economic activity compared to non-treated 356 municipalities, and robust to several model specifications and controls. As many countries are beginning 357 to reopen and ease mobility restrictions, localized lockdowns can be a critical tool to control COVID-19 358 resurgence while minimizing economic impact. We found no evidence that localized lockdowns generate 359 a proportionally larger or smaller effect in the economy when applied to areas of different sizes. 360Critically, our results suggest that epidemiological criteria should guide decisions about the optimal size 361 of lockdown areas; the proportional effects of lockdowns on the economy seem to be unchanged by scale. 362We thank Sebastian Piña (Universidad de Chile) for research assistance, Paula Aguirre (Pontificia 364Universidad Católica de Chile) for help with Figure 1 , and the Servicio de Impuestos Internos (Chilean 365Since lockdowns and mobility could work in the same mechanism, in column (3) of Table S1 , we use the 521 method of instrumental variables. This is a method to analyze how lockdown-induced shocks to mobility 522 impact economic activity. For expositional purposes, this is done in two stages. In the bottom panel of 523 column (3), the so-called first-stage has a good fit, meaning that lockdowns impact mobility. On the top 524 panel, the second stage regresses VAT on the lockdown-induced changes in mobility which were 525 calculated in the first stage above. This second stage has a large and significant coefficient of 0.79. To get 526 correct standard errors, these two stages are jointly estimated. 527",Chile,abstract,2020-09-23,9
4d302d452c4955de2ca7567c5c226b397e42e94b,Is Higher Viral Load in SARS-CoV-2 Associated with Death?,"The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has been responsible for causing more than 30 million infections around the world since December 2019. 1 Although the severity is mild in most cases, several risk factors for moderate to severe COVID-19 have been identified, including older age and comorbidities. 2, 3 However, the association between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and clinical outcomes remains understudied. Two Chinese studies demonstrated that the viral load of hospitalized patients was higher than that of nonhospitalized ones. 4, 5 Also, a recent American study demonstrated that higher viral loads were associated with a higher risk of intubation and death for inpatients. 6 Nevertheless, correlation between viral load and hospitalization risk for inpatients and outpatients remains unclear.Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by the reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay in nasopharyngeal swab specimens is the primary diagnostic method for COVID-19. 7 Data concerning cycle threshold (Ct) values, which are inversely proportional to the amount of RNA virus' copies, have been used as an inference of the viral load. Based on the hypothesis that the SARS-CoV-2 Ct value could also act as a biomarker of disease severity, clinical outcome, and mortality, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 875 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at a large university hospital in São Paulo, Brazil, between March 2020 and June 2020.Study population and setting. This retrospective observational cohort study involved patients and healthcare workers (HCW) who presented with respiratory symptoms from March 14, 2020 to June 17, 2020, at São Paulo Hospital in the Federal University of São Paulo, Brazil. All hospitalized patients considered suspected of COVID-19 had a nasopharyngeal swab sample collected on admission and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2. We also included all HCWs presenting with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 as part of a routine surveillance. All the specimens were stored in 2 mL sterile Ringer's lactate solution (Fresenius, Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Germany) in sterile tubes and transported to the Virology Laboratory at the Federal University of São Paulo for testing.Viral load analysis method. We used the Ct values as a semi-quantitative measure of viral load. The amount of viral RNA copies present in the positive samples is inversely proportional to the corresponding Ct value. That is, the greater the amount of viral RNA, the lower the Ct value.Samples and RNA preparation. Nasal swab samples were collected from the patients at admission. RNA of the samples was purified using the Quick-RNA Viral Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified RNA was stored at −80°C.SARS-CoV-2 detection. Viral detection was performed using the AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR reagents (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Austin, TX), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reactions were performed in a 20-μL total reaction volume containing 5.0 μL purified RNA, 400 nM primers, and 200 nM probes following the CDC U.S. protocol targeting the N1 and N2 sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein gene and human ribonuclease P gene serving as an endogenous control. 8 For the semi-quantitative analysis, we used the Ct values of the more sensitive N2 target. Samples with Ct values < 40 were considered positive.Data collection. Information on age, hospitalization status, and clinical outcome was retrieved from the electronic medical records of the patients. According to the WHO guidelines, patients were stratified into groups on the basis of age, as follows: 0-5, 5-14, 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and > 85 years. Disease severity and clinical outcome were classified as follows: mild (no hospitalization), moderate (hospitalization in the ward for observation and oxygen therapy), severe (hospitalization in the intensive care unit), and discharge or death. Patients who were still hospitalized, awaiting a defined outcome, during data collection were not considered for the statistical analysis.Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t-test for parametric data and the Mann-Whitney test for nonparametric data. Significance level was set at a Pvalue of < 0.05.Among the 875 individuals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, more than a half (50.9%, 446/875) were female patients. The median age was 48 years (range, 2-97 years), and the median Ct value was 24. A Ct value of < 25 (472/875) indicated high viral load and > 24 (403/875) low viral load.The initial Ct values for each age-group are presented in Figure 1 . We found no significant differences.The Ct values were analyzed according to the disease severitymild (50.1%; 439/875; median, 22); moderate (30.4%; 266/875; median, 27), and severe (19.5%; 170/875; median, 21.5)-in the 875 patients. The initial Ct value of patients with moderate disease was higher and significantly different from that of patients with mild (P < 0.0001) and severe (P < 0.0001) diseases ( Figure 2) .Comparison of the initial Ct value with clinical outcome (discharge or death) showed that survivors presented a significantly higher value than that of non-survivors: median Ct values were 27 and 21, respectively (P < 0.0001; Figure 3 ). Mortality rates were 46% (87/191) among patients with a high viral load (Ct < 25) and 22% (41/185) among patients with a low viral load. The risk of in-hospital mortality was also higher in patients with a high viral load (Ct < 25) than in those with a low viral load (Ct > 24), and this association was statistically significant (OR: 2.93; 95% CI: 1.87-4.60; P < 0.0001).In this study, a higher admission SARS-CoV-2 viral load (Ct values < 25) was associated with an outcome of death, as also demonstrated previously. 6 The correlation of viral load with clinical outcome and disease severity has been investigated with different endemic respiratory viruses, but most results have not been conclusive. [9] [10] [11] [12] However, in the case of prepandemic avian influenza H5N1, higher viral loads were associated with more severe disease and poorer outcome, 13 as seen with SARS-CoV-2 in our study.Notably, SARS-CoV-2 viral load distribution according to the Ct values from initial samples followed a V curve in this study, with mildly affected and critically ill patients having higher viral loads than the hospitalized ones with a better outcome. First of all, the population with mild disease in this study mainly included healthcare workers tested in a very early stage of disease, when viral replication is very high. 4,5 Furthermore, high viral loads in patients with mild disease were also described by Argyropoulos et al. 14 However, although their study demonstrated that hospitalized patients had a lower viral load than nonhospitalized ones, disease severity was not categorized.On the other hand, our study presented a unique stratified clinical expression of disease including mild (nonhospitalized), moderate, and severe disease in the hospitalized. So the difference in viral loads between moderately affected and critically ill patients might be explained by later viral peak and longer virus-shedding periods in the latter. 4, 5 This could also be a result of orientation to complete isolation at home if no warning signs were present, to avoid emergency rooms' overcrowding. Therefore, most patients presented to the emergency department during a later period of disease, with more severe symptoms' onset.The results of this study must be interpreted considering the methodological limitations. We focused on virological aspects and did not include the effects of comorbidities, clinical symptoms, date of admission and sample collection, and use of antivirals or antibiotics because of the heterogeneity in the care of hospitalized patients, and requirement of a larger cohort for subgroup analysis. The duration of symptoms before testing may be an important variable. However, date of symptom onset was not consistently reported by medical assistants at this hospital. In any case, previous studies demonstrated that patients with other acute viral infections tend to present to the hospital after expected peak of viral load. 15 In summary, admission SARS-CoV-2 viral load, demonstrated by the Ct value, was independently associated with mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. These findings suggest that the Ct value could be used as a tool to help with the identification of patients at a higher risk for severe outcomes.",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-28,9
03dbf1feb067f3dce6bf705a32e19416acce7b4f,"COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the Metropolitan Region, Chile: time, space, 1 and structural factors","To identify the determinants of infection and mortality due to COVID-19 in the 205 Metropolitan Region in Chile, we carried out multivariable regressions to explain the set 206 of dependent variables, using the three groups of explanatory variables described above. The first step in the spatial analysis is the definition of neighbors. In this case, we used a 215 first-order queen contiguity matrix, i.e. we defined as neighbors all municipalities that 216 share a border. Given the nature of the data-the existence of clusters in different areas of 217 the region and the high heterogeneity in the size of the municipalities-a distance-based 218 approach was discarded (79) .Incidence and mortality data were collected and calculated using Microsoft Excel.The first result is that the determinants of infections and deaths are not the same.However, as expected, some variables seem to explain variation in both types of explaining cumulative rates than peaks and days to the peak, and the overall fit (R 2 ) is 328 larger than for the infection regressions in Table 3 . As before, using Poisson regressions 329 for days to the peak does not change the main results.Based on the results from Tables 3 and 4, a simplified set of regressions is estimated. A 334 potential problem with inference, in this case, is related to the degrees of freedom due to 335 a large number of explanatory variables and the relatively small sample (n=52). Table 5 336 shows these reduced models, based on the previous results (infection and deaths OLS First, adding a spatial dimension removes the spatial correlation in the residuals in six 357 cases where OLS residuals show spatial autocorrelation: days to peak of cases (column 358 1), peak of deaths (columns 2 to 5), and days to peaks of deaths (columns 6 to 10).",Chile,abstract,2020-09-18,9

This is especially true regarding measures to prevent viral transmission given the lack of a vaccine or effective medical actions to control the disease.In Brazil, the conflict between measures from the central government (denying the severity of the issue) and those from states and municipalities (following sanitary and epidemiological guidelines), in addition to the insufficient and poor medical and hospital structure to fight the disease, has made evident the extremely high vulnerability of the population, particularly of those suffering from intense social and spatial exclusion, e.g., the indigenous and quilombola peoples. On February 26th, the then Health Minister defined COVID-19 as another type of flu in the history of the country; in the same week, the Brazilian currency (BRL) plummeted to critical levels. In April 16th, with an accumulated figure of 1933 deaths and an aggravating political crisis, a new Health Minister took office and resigned in less than a month due to the President's insistence to amplify the use of hydroxychloroquine, which showed little efficacy and severe side effects under clinical trials [2, 3] .Amidst the magnitude of this unprecedented public health crisis in Latin America, following the continuous dismantling and weakening of the Brazilian Public Health System (the Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS), Brazil has also become the scenario of political and social conflicts. Besides changes of Health and Justice Ministers, a meeting of State Ministers from April 22nd (when the death count was nearing the 3 thousand mark) was made public after an order by the Federal Supreme Court in response to accusations that the President had been meddling in the Brazilian judiciary police. In this meeting, the Environment Minister, who had already gained international notoriety due to his negligent watch over the Amazon [4] , stated the moment should be used to pass more flexible environmental protection laws-i.e., for occupying indigenous land and weakening the surveillance and prosecution of violations-since the media was focused on covering the pandemic. In this context, violations of indigenous rights and traditions have taken on new proportions, such as the case of Yanomami babies in northern Brazil who were buried without their mothers' knowledge [5] and the distribution of chloroquine pills by the Brazilian Army in isolated indigenous territories [6] .This context is presented above via examples and simplifications of episodes that led to the widespread crisis currently faced by the largest economy of Latin America, and it directly affects original peoples, namely, the indigenous and quilombola communities. After the rights ensured by the Constitution of 1988, which provided guidelines for guaranteeing land titles to indigenous and quilombola peoples during the democratic governments following the military dictatorship , as well as the Health Equity Policies [7] which foreshadowed the SUS, indigenous and quilombola peoples have been living under an extremely vulnerable situation in the current political context of the pandemic. In this text, we present the evidence available regarding the occurrence of COVID-19 in indigenous and quilombola territories in South Brazil (i.e., the states of Paraná, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul), seeking to alert the scientific community and the international society as means to revert this current trend of decimating Brazilian original peoples.The root and effects of colonialism have been welldocumented in seminal works [8, 9] . Especially in Latin American and the Caribbean, the colonial enterprise which enabled the development of the capitalist economy was forged under the social classification of ""race,"" contributing to what Peruvian sociologist Anibal Quijano [10] considers the current pattern of world power, engendered on the coloniality of power, wherein race and its intersections of class, gender, sexual orientation, disabilities, and geographical origin act as the basis of a universal social classification standard grounded on economic and social exploration.During the colonial period (1500-1889), Brazil received, until 1850, approximately 3,143,903 million Africans from Western-Central Africa and Southeast Africa, from the Indian Ocean Islands and St. Helena Island. Out of this total, 4.2% landed on the Amazon, 38.7% on Bahia, 12.1% on Pernambuco, and 44.2% on Southeast Brazil [11, 12] . Regarding the indigenous people, according to indigenous leader Dinamam Jurum Tuxá of Brazil's Indigenous People Articulation [13] , from the colonial regime until the 1970s, the Brazilian indigenous population was reduced from 5 million to approximately 450 thousand people, comprising 305 peoples, 274 languages. Exactly 174 peoples currently live in voluntary isolation in various parts of the country. Basic rights were only ensured in 1988, after the last military dictatorship and the promulgation of the Federal Constitution. This included the right to health (the creation of the SUS) and the positive recognition of the indigenous population and their specificities regarding education, cultural, and social and cultural organization. Despite being guaranteed by the Law and present on maps, the demarcation of indigenous lands is still subjected to internal conflicts [14] [15] [16] , regional quarrels [17] [18] [19] , and legal and historical disputes [16, 19, 20] surrounding specific governmental policies that can effectively ensure full equity.Accordingly, the 1988 Constitution granted quilombola communities the right to definitive ownership of their lands, stating the importance of historical lands and stepping away from the understanding of the Portuguese Ultramarine Council (1741), which considered quilombos as groups of fugitive slaves that presented risks to the colonial order until 1889 [21] [22] [23] . Therefore, it took the Brazilian State over 100 years to recognize a share of these peoples, herein considered original peoples. Some aspects of the historical process of invisibilizing Brazilian indigenous and quilombola peoples (the later are not included in the census) are the irregular surveys and the various techniques employed to understand the characteristics of this population, according to how ""race"" and ""color"" are understood. For example, indigenous peoples were only included in the demographic census in 1872 (under the term ""caboclas"") but were not included in the years 1900, 1920, 1940, 1950, and 1960 , returning only in 1991 under the classification of ""indigenous"" for the ""race/ color"" category [24] .South Brazil, the main territory discussed in this text, is commonly considered the ""European"" part of the country due to its subtropical climate-in contrast to the predominant tropical climate-and its historical process of European and Asian immigration (the latter especially in the Paraná state) motivated by successive governments (from the colonial period to the Republic). Since the end of the nineteenth century, governments have employed various legal resources to stimulate European settlers to come to Brazil and replace African and indigenous forced laborers. This movement was based on racist theories used to justify slavery, aimed at whitening the population. It defined Brazilian miscegenation as ""racial degeneration"" and a hindrance to the development of the ""nation"" [25, 26] .Keeping a large part of its population in poverty and excluding it from having basic rights and essential assets led Brazil to be extremely unequal and polarized, with a richer, white, Central-Southern region, and a poorer, colored, Northern-Northeastern region, as shown on Tables 1 and 2.  Tables 1 and 2 show the differences in the Brazilian population landscape, where southern states, especially Rio Grande do Sul state and Santa Catarina state, have a predominantly white population with better indicators than the national average in regard to life expectancy at birth, child mortality rate, and percentage of people living in extreme poverty. For example, whereas in the Northeast region people in extreme poverty represent 14.9% of the total population, in the South region they are only 1.6%; for the Santa Catarina state, they are below the regional average, with 1.0%. The overt regional disparities that show a white South with better indicators hide the extreme vulnerabilities of its non-white population, especially indigenous and Black people, that face the pressures of social and racial divisions arising from existing diverse spatial configurations [29] . It is also important to remember that despite northern Brazil holding the highest percentage of indigenous (1.9% in comparison to the national average of 0.4%) and mixed-race people (66.8% in comparison to the national average of 43.1%) while also encompassing the Amazon, the remaining original peoples (indigenous and quilombola) are distributed throughout the national territory (as shown on the map on Fig. 1 ).The 1988 Constitution defined health as a duty of the Brazilian State. The perspective of implementing a sole universal national health system, SUS, finally contemplated the indigenous and quilombola populations after centuries of exclusion [30] . The quality of life of these populations has been continuously vulnerable [31, 32] due to the inequities caused by race and gender intersections [33] [34] [35] [36] . In Brazil, the quilombola [37] and indigenous populations [38] constantly face health violations, as denounced by scientific researches [39] [40] [41] [42] .Public health policies geared towards the indigenous and quilombola populations have been promoted in the first decade of this century in consonance with the third National Plan for Human Rights, and complying to the Brazilian State alignment during the Durban Review Conference and its protagonism in leading the Global South in the United Nations [43] . This was the result of an unprecedented stance against the myth of racial democracy in Brazilian history, which had negated and invisibilized structural racism and the violence perpetrated against the Black and indigenous populations [44, 45] .The National Indigenous Health Policy from 2002 [46] was an important state response to its indigenous population and their specific demands. This document served as the basis for a health subsystem rooted in a geographical view of organizing health actions-the indigenous special health districts (shown in Fig. 1 ). This basic unit is defined as a geographical, populational, administrative, and dynamic ethnic and cultural space with no direct relation to the borders of states and municipalities where indigenous lands are located [47] . This perspective finds epistemological consonance in the knowledge of these peoples, given that indigenous territories are spaces where rulings are based not only on hegemonic value but also on ancestral and spiritual values. Accordingly, the Ministry of Health also includes a special department for indigenous health. The data on the indigenous population is part of an information system for indigenous health care [48] . Despite this data fragmentation, these subsystems and their operation have considered social and demographic specificities that were essential for the survival of these peoples, although criticisms about access to information intensified during the pandemic [49] . Current data by the Ministry of Health show there are 34 indigenous special health districts responsible for providing services to 760.350 indigenous people from 416 ethnicities, living in 6.238 villages. Figure 1 shows the coverage of health care to indigenous peoples around the country according to these health districts.After the current President took office in January 2019, one of the first actions by the Ministry of Health, besides compromising the effect of equity policies through significant structural changes [50] , was to extinct the special department for indigenous health, as well as the indigenous special health districts [51] . This hygienist and homogenizing view sought to incorporate indigenous care within the context of the general population; thus, not considering the historical inequities these peoples have suffered over the ascension of a discourse based on a so-called ""universal Brazilian citizen,"" as mentioned by the Brazilian Education Minister during the tragic ministerial meeting of April 2020, in which he stated his hate for the ""indigenous peoples"" because there is only the ""Brazilian people."" Also, during 2019, the presidential decree was revoked during a hearing of the Senate Commission on Human Rights organized by the Brazil's Indigenous People Articulation.In 2007, on National Black Awareness Day, the National Health Policy for the Black Population [52] was presented. One of its goals was to ensure wide access to health actions and services to the Black population, as well as to the population living in rural areas and forests, particularly the quilombola population. The quilombola and indigenous populations are also addressed by the National Health Policy for the Rural and Forest Populations [53] . In contrast to the indigenous population, the quilombola population does not have a specific subsystem, partly due to its heterogeneous spread over the national territory, including communities at state capitals and the metropolises of Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul) and Florianópolis (Santa Catarina).Secondary data were used to elaborate the map of territories under siege, herein considered as the ones located on spatially autocorrelated clusters. The data regarding COVID-19 were extracted on June 1st and encompassed the accumulated number cases up to the last day of the last epidemiological week of May. The information is available at the Brazilian Ministry of Health website <https://covid.saude.gov.br/> and has been organized in tables according to municipality, state, and health region, while also aggregating data on the accumulated number of new cases and deaths. Information regarding sex, race/color, ethnicity, and age were not available. Spatial data on quilombola communities were extracted from the Palmares Foundation website <http:// www.palmares.gov.br/?page_id=37551>, and data on indigenous lands and health districts were extracted from the National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) <http://www.funai.gov. br/index.php/shape>. Due to the bureaucratic process surrounding the recognition of quilombola and indigenous lands, this analysis encompassed not only certified lands but also communities under study, i.e., the ones who have filed for analysis by the State but are not yet recognized on technical documents issued by the relevant institutions (Palmares Foundation for the quilombola and the National Indian Foundation for the indigenous people) (Fig. 2) ( Table 3) .The spatial exploratory analysis method was applied using a spatial autocorrelation test for accumulated cases of COVID-19. The Global Moran's I was used to measure spatial autocorrelation. This is a spatial analysis extension available for the ArcGIS da ESRI-Environmental Systems Research Institute software [54] . This index also tests if the connected areas show higher similarity regarding the studied measure in comparison to what is expected on a random pattern, varying from − 1 to + 1. Therefore, the spatial autocorrelation degree can be quantified: a positive figure for direct correlation (above 0) and a negative figure for inverse correlation (below 0). The Moran Map was employed as a graphical device to view results. To achieve this, a significance assessment was performed on the Moran index value for each municipality by comparing it with the null hypothesis of non-existing spatial autocorrelation. The result is shown in Fig. 3 .Based on Fig. 3 , the municipalities shown in gray (High-High) have a high accumulated number of COVID-19 cases and are surrounded by municipalities that also have high figures. Municipalities in light-gray (Low-Low) are municipalities with a low accumulated number of COVID-19 cases that are surrounded by municipalities in this same situation. Traced and dotted municipalities (High-Low and Low-High, respectively) are municipalities with a high accumulated number of COVID-19 cases near municipalities with a low number and municipalities with a low accumulated number of COVID-19 cases near municipalities with a high number, respectively. Municipalities in white are non-significant regions with a p > 0.05, i.e., municipalities for which it is not possible to confirm whether spatial autocorrelation is present. In other words, they correspond to municipalities that show no correlation to the accumulated number of novel coronavirus cases in neighboring municipalities. It is also important to highlight the fact that despite some municipalities in the South region Source: Authors, based on data by the Ministry of Health being classified as non-significant, this does not mean they should not be considered during the analysis. These municipalities may also have an accumulated number of COVID-19 cases but are not influenced by their neighboring municipalities; i.e., there is no spatial autocorrelation ( Table 4 ). The first aspect is that a large portion of indigenous and quilombola territories are centered around the clusters with the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases, in all three states. Amidst this critical scenario, numberless indigenous and quilombola peoples are settled around capitals and metropolitan areas. In the state of Santa Catarina, the High-High spatial characteristic extends from the state capital, Florianópolis, along the northern coast up to the border to the state of Paraná. In the state of Rio Grande do Sul, the situation can be considered critical due to the presence of four certified urban quilombos inside the state capital, Porto Alegre, as well as two quilombos undergoing the certification process. Porto Alegre (approximately 1.4 million inhabitants) is also the most racially segregated city in the country [55] which increases the urgency for help even in these territories.The second noteworthy aspect is related to the concentration of indigenous and quilombola territories near High-Low clusters. This is the situation around most territories in the rural areas of the states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul. This outlook, therefore, gives the territory an aspect of being under siege; i.e., indigenous and quilombola peoples have at their borders a spatial scenario that increases their vulnerability and risk in the COVID-19 pandemic.Notwithstanding the spatial characterization of novel coronavirus cases, the issues surrounding a permanent state of Fig. 3 Indigenous and quilombola territories and the Global Moran's I siege become denser. The High-Low cluster consists predominantly of cities with low population, which for the Brazilian health system represents severe situations regarding socioenvironmental determinants in disease development. The first thing that should be mentioned is the low or nonexistent coverage of the basic sanitation network for indigenous and quilombola territories in these regions, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, IBGE [56] . Moreover, there is no middle-or high-complexity care network available in their proximity. It is widely known that in the most affected places, there is a rapid increase in demand for hospital beds in Intensive Care Units (ICU) with assisted ventilation for people with severe acute respiratory syndrome. Therefore, indigenous and quilombola peoples face physical barriers when seeking access to health care during the pandemic, since these communities are far from the main driveways and intercity passenger transportation stops.Another intriguing issue is the monitoring of epidemiological data about these peoples throughout the pandemic. The national emergency study performed by the Ministry of Health does not investigate traditional peoples [57] . Accordingly, national pandemic strategies have not included guidelines regarding these communities, particularly indigenous ones, which goes against international health recommendations [58] . However, recent scientific evidence shows that the so-called ""ethnic minorities"" have a higher risk of adverse outcomes related to infections by the novel coronavirus due to their situation of inequity [59] [60] [61] . It is known that the onset of the virus on Brazilian indigenous communities constitutes the catastrophic decimation of entire villages [62, 63] . This is a recurring situation when discussing the measures adopted or neglected by the Brazilian government, which may result in the elimination of these vulnerable populations; this can effectively be considered a necropolitical action by the State [64] .Moreover, it is necessary to face the issues of underreporting and data quality regarding COVID-19 cases in the country. Mandatory reports of diseases, which allows for quilombola and indigenous peoples to be identified, have low-quality data in regard to race/color and ethnicity. The obligation to report health information systems is recent and has only been implemented for a little more than a decade [65] . Besides discrimination, there is also a lack of knowledge by health professionals regarding the self-identification of these people. To make matters worse, since the beginning of reports on the number of cases on the Ministry of Health website, it has not been possible to gain public access to the number of COVID-19 cases per race/color and ethnicity. This situation has led to the need for an initiative like the one by the National Coordination for the Articulation of Black, Rural, and Quilombola Communities, which has been performing a parallel survey to gather data to monitor the situation [66] .The Brazilian government political stance in this global context has been proven to be peremptory, sectarian, and unconcerned with the repercussion of the pandemic to the population in general, which has gathered notoriety amongst the international scientific community [67] . Despite now being reported worldwide and received with bewilderment in the international community, the President's contempt is not new for indigenous and quilombola populations, but rather another facet of his hate speech towards the indigenous and quilombola peoples, which has been present since his 2018 electoral campaign [68] .There have been minor advances concerning the historical decimation process suffered by these populations, which has permeated colonial Brazil and been present until its current democracy. Such advances include the recognition of indigenous and quilombola lands and equity policies. However, these humble achievements are under dire risk in the current context of political turmoil surrounding the COVID-19 epidemic. As presented during this paper, which is part of a broader research endeavor surrounding the impact of COVID-19 on indigenous and quilombola communities, the spatial concentration of novel coronavirus cases poses a real immediate risk of decimating indigenous and quilombola communities in South Brazil, particularly in the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, aside from accelerating the historical process of social and economic exclusion in central Paraná. For communities on central regions and the peripheries of state capitals (but also for ones under siege by clusters on inner state areas), health services are markedly precarious and tend to deteriorate the survival conditions these peoples already live in. The novel coronavirus pandemic presents new obstacles to maintaining the lives of Brazilian original peoples, who were already on an uncertain and worrisome path. Overcoming these obstacles is not solely an issue of providing the best possible coping strategies for this unprecedented sanitary crisis; it also depends on dealing with other historical crises, such as the legal recognition of the right to the land and the right to exist, going beyond the predatory economic model imposed by the current political and social framework. To surpass this challenge, an important step is mobilizing leaderships and widening the global reach of their voices and histories, as to prevent the tsunami [69] . looming on the Brazilian horizon which will, directly and indirectly, affect other countries of the Global South and the world.Author Contributions The study conception and design, material preparation, data collection, and analysis were performed by Maurício Polidoro and Daniel Canavese.

Please note that, during the production process, errors may be discovered which could affect the content, and all legal disclaimers that apply to the journal pertain.The recent outbreak associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made a deep impact on modern science. Several research groups have been working to achieve two main goals: to obtain a vaccine and/or pharmacological targets that could help to control the pandemic (Ahn et al., 2020; Amanat and Krammer, 2020; Liu et al., 2020, Ricke and Malone, 2020; Tu et al., 2020) . However, as it happened J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 in previous outbreaks, we need to fully understand the viral biology/host interaction to reach these goals (Parvez and Parveen, 2017) . In this report, we are focused on the early stages driving host selectivity for SARS-CoV-2. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 infection starts with the interaction between the viral spike protein and its counterpart, the ACE2 cell receptor . Previously, we predicted that the changes in the SARS-CoV-2viral spike protein improved its ability to bind to ACE2, compared to SARS-CoV (Ortega et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, more scientific data have been published since then, helping us to better understand the main factors associated with these interactions.First, several crystals structures detailing the interaction between the viral spike protein and ACE2 are available in the Protein Data Bank (Lan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020) . Also, new receptors, such as GRP78, are described as possible co-receptors for SARS-CoV-2 (Ibrahim et al., 2020) . GRP78 is a chaperone protein related to the unfolded protein response in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) (Ge et al., 2019) . Under stress conditions, GRP78 is over expressed and translocated to the cell membrane (Wang et al., 2009) ; there, the substrate-binding domain (SBD) serves as a receptor for viral entry (Ibrahim et al., 2020) . Furthermore, these receptors have been correlated with other CoVs such as MERS, Bat-HKU9, and other viral species (Dengue and Human papillomavirus) (Nain et al., 2017; Chu et al., 2018; Jindadamrongwech et al., 2004; Elfiky 2020) .After the virus interacts with its receptor, several changes occur driving viral internalization via endocytosis (Letko et al., 2020) . Nonetheless, the proteolytic processing of the viral spike protein is a key step to expose the fusion motif and release the virus to the cytoplasm (Hoffmann et al., 2020) ; this process is well known for other coronaviruses (SARS and MERS) (Belouzard et al., 2009; Glowacka et al., 2011; Kleine-Weber et al., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f proteolytic processing is driven by Transmembrane protein 2 (TMPRSS2). However, there is no clear evidence of whether or not ACE2, GRP78, or TMPRSS2 are crucial to determine the host selectivity for SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, recent reports showed that SARS-CoV-2 could infect domestic cats and ferrets, partially dogs but not pigs . Thus, there is a need to know the possible reservoirs or alternative viral hosts to fully control the pandemic. Moreover, a better understanding of the viral infection in these hosts could provide some clues to control the virus in humans. Based on this, we established a comparative in silico analysis of the main factors (ACE2, GRP78, and TMPRSS2) associated with SARS-CoV-2 entry to understand the structural mechanism related to the host selectivity. Sequences for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were retrieved from GenBank; accession numbers are shown in the sequence alignments. Sequences used for GRP78 are shown in the respective alignment. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis were generated using DNAMAN with default parameters.The crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein bound to human ACE2, PDB code 6M0J, 6LZG, 6M17, were retrieved and analyzed. Homology structural models of mice, cat, pig, ferret, and dog for ACE2 were determined. The data obtained for the crystal structure 6M0J were selected for the comparative analyses between the different viral spike protein-ACE2 interactions. The homology models for the non-human ACE2 enzymes were generated using the crystal structure of human ACE2 as a template (PDB code 6M17). On the other hand, the structural modeling of TMPRSS2 was developed using the crystal structure of Serine protease Hepsin (PDB code 5CE1) as a template template (Ortega et al., 2020c) . All models were obtained with the SWISS-MODEL modeling server and the DeepView/Swiss-PdbViewer 4.01 software (Arnold et al., 2006) . Hydrogen atoms on each structure were added and partial charges were assigned for energy refinement. The obtained models were subjected to a MD simulation using NAMD 2.9 (Phillips et al., 2005) , as described by Ortega and colleagues (2019) using the CHARMM 22 force field (Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2010) and Gasteiger charges. The obtained structures represent the lowest energy frame of the MD simulations. The quality of the models was established J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f via ProSA (Wiederstein and Sippl, 2007) and PROCHECK programs (Laskowski et al., 1993) .The crystal structure for SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein bound to human ACE2 (PDB code 6M0J), human ACE2 (PDB code 6M17) and for human GRP78 (PDB code 5E84) were downloaded from Protein Data Bank. Protein preparation was carried out as described above. Human ACE2 was used as a template for the different ACE2 hosts.These models were also evaluated against the viral spike protein through molecular docking. Then, the obtained binding patterns and affinity estimations were analyzed and compared. The docking was developed in two steps: first, the structure of the complex between the ligand (viral spike protein) and receptor (ACE2 or GRP78), delimiting the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) to that described for human ACE2 6M0J or the Substrate Binding Domain (SBD) β for GRP78, was performed using Z-dock 3.0.2 software (Pierce et al., 2014) . Second, the resulting docking data were processed and analyzed employing the tools from PRODIGY software (Xue et al., 2016) . Finally, these results were processed, clustered, and analyzed considering binding energies and interacting residues for each viral spike protein-ACE2 or GRP78 complex.TMPRSS2 homology models from different hosts were used to evaluate the binding of TMPRSS2 human inhibitors. The initial models were optimized through addition of hydrogen atoms and partial charges. The obtained structures were further submitted to restrained molecular mechanic refinement via NAMD software (Phillips et al., 2005) , J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fWithin this study, we developed a bioinformatics analysis of three proteins (ACE2, TMPRRS2, and GRP78) described as main factors associated with the early steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection in several hosts. First, sequence analysis was carried out for a broad range of hosts, emphasizing our interest in the main interacting regions related to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein recognition and establishing comparison to the well-known susceptible hosts. Then, proteins of hosts with known susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated for homology modeling and docking studies. Altogether, these bioinformatics approaches help to gain deeper understanding of the molecular interactions between the viral spike and these proteins and their relation to host susceptibility.The viral spike protein mediates coronavirus entry into host cells. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that specifically recognizes ACE2, which appears to be the key functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2. The receptor recognition of the spike protein is an important determinant of viral infectivity, pathogenesis, and host range. In the present study, we developed homology models of a series of ACE2 proteins from different hosts (mice, cat, pig, ferret, and dog) in order to gain insight about the structural mechanism related to host selectivity. Then, a computational protein-protein docking approach was performed to predict the structure of complexes with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and compared it with that of the human ACE2 complex. Phylogenetic analysis of the ACE2 from different mammalian hosts reveals a high sequence identity among them (with more than 80% identity in comparison to the human protein) ( Figure 1A and Table S1 ). Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f contact residues directly involved in the recognition of the SARS-COV-2 RBD domain are shown in Figure 1 B. The ACE2 enzyme showed substitution of specific amino acids residues of the contact region and particularly of those involved in the recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain. The amino acid residues Lys31, Glu35, Asp38, Met82, and Lys353 from the human cell receptor have been linked to recognition of viral spike protein (Shang et al., 2020) . Based on the homology observed between the different proteins and the known degree of susceptibility of each host previously reported , the structural models of ACE2 enzymes (mice, cat, pig, ferret, and dog) were established using the human enzyme as a template (PDB code 6M17). Comparison of homology models of ACE2 from selected mammalian hosts with that of human suggested that the structures are very similar, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) ranging from 0.09 to 0.77 (708 C- atoms). In addition, an examination of the Ramachandran plot (not shown) indicated a good overall geometry for ACE2 models. The protein folding energy from the protein models exhibited typical features of native structures (Table S1 ). These resulting ACE2 models (peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2) were employed to collect the complexes with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain. The hACE2 receptor recognition of the SARS-COV-2 RBD domain has been extensively studied and these studies showed that the SARS-CoV-2 RBM forms a large binding interface with 20 amino acids of hACE2 (Lan et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020) . The overall structures of ACE2 from different mammalian hosts in conjunction with the RBD domain are similar to those of the hACE2/SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex (Table S2 ). These results show that ACE2 enzymes recognize the RBD domain of the viral spike protein with the putative binding domain, including mainly the arch-shaped α1 helix. The α2 helix and the loop that connects the β3 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and β4 antiparallel strands also make limited contributions to the coordination of RBD (Figure 2 and Table S3 ). Despite the overall similarity, some non-synonymous sequence variations are found on their respective interface. In the ACE2 α1 helix: Gln24Leu24 (dogs, pigs, cats, and ferrets), Asp30Asn30 (mice) and His34Tyr34 (dogs and ferrets)/Leu34 (pigs). In the ACE2 α2 helix: Leu79Thr79 (mice)/His79 (ferrets), Met82Ser82 (mice)/Thr82 (dogs, pigs, cats and ferrets) and Tyr83Phe83 (mice).Variations found in the α1 helix between the different mammalian hosts reduce the hydrogen bonds formed with the RBD domain of the viral spike protein in mice and dogs complexes ( Figure 2D and 2E). The variations found at the end of the α2 helix leaves this region without any hydrogen bond in the mice ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex ( Figure   2D ). The formation of ionic pairs (salt bridges, N-O pair, and long-range interactions) (Kumar and Nussinov, 2002) between ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexes was also examined (Table 1) . Linking the arch-shaped α1 helix of ACE2 with the RBD domain in the human complex generates a strong salt bridge interaction between Asp30 and Lys417 (Lan et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020) , and three long-range interactions between Lys31-Glu484, His34-Glu406, and Glu37-Arg403. Less ionic pairs are present for mice, dogs, and pigs complexes with RBD; moreover, for the mice complex only one long-range interaction is seen. In cats and ferrets ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexes we detected four ionic pairs; although, in the ferret complex the third ion pair is absent, due to a nonsynonymous mutation, a salt bridge interaction is observed between Arg354 and Asp405.Altogether, the results showed here suggest that the ionic pairs produced between the host ACE2 and the viral spike play a pivotal role in the complex stabilization, then, allowing the virus to attach into the target cell. However, other cellular factors could play a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f secondary role that allows them to finally establishing a successful infection. Some of these factors are discussed in the following sections.The proteolytic processing of the viral spike protein is a key step during the infection process of SARS-CoV-2. Several reports showed that this reaction could be driven by the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2. This protein had been described with an intracellular domain (residues 1 to 84), transmembrane spanning domain (residues 84-106), low-density lipoprotein receptor domain (LDLRA: residues 133-147) and two extracellular domains. The homology models of TMPRSS2 from different hosts (mice, cat, pig, ferret, and dog) showed the two extracellular domains; the cysteine-rich domain (residues 148-242) and the serine protease domain (residues 255-489) with the presence of the residue Ser441 as a catalytic residue. Here, we performed multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis of TMPRSS2 for several mammalian hosts. These proteins display a certain degree of homology (more than 70%) with the human protein ( Figure 3A ). Of note, the catalytic triad is conserved among all the proteins and in the amino acid residues of the active site ( Figure 3B ), no major differences were observed. Thus, it can be speculated that the viral spike could be enzymatically processed in a similar pattern in all described hosts.Currently, there is no crystal structure for TMPRSS2; we applied computational algorithms to develop models for selected mammalian host. The template serine protease Hepsin (PDB code 5CE1) showed 35.7% identity with the human TMPRSS2 sequence. TMPRSS2 serine protease domain from different hosts (mice, cat, pig, ferret, and dog) shares~83% identity with the human protein. Interestingly, few structural differences were evident between the TMPRSS2 for each host. Figure 4 displays the 3D structure of the serine J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f protease domain generated for each enzyme where the residues His296, Asp345 and Ser441 are present as a catalytic triad. Table S4 summarizes the main structural parameters evaluated for each structure. The RMSD for the whole enzyme was around 1 Å and 2 Å for the serine protease domain. Assessment of the Ramachandran plots indicates a good overall geometry for the models, with ∼ 83% of the residues in the most favored regions.The energy of protein-folding, as determined with ProSa-web, showed typical features of native structures with a z-score value of -7.00. All these structural parameters are in agreement with the homology between the models. Some reports described that TMPRSS2 inhibition could be related to an antiviral effect.Indeed, for SARS-CoV-2 this was demonstrated in vitro (Hoffman et al., 2020) . Based on that, this study was established to evaluate through molecular docking whether or not the inhibitors of human TMPRSS2 may affect the enzyme from other hosts. A small library was built by using Camostat and Nafamostat pharmacophore structures. The structural similarity search was carried out on the ZINC database, choosing only compounds that have already been evaluated in humans; in total, fifteen compounds met our criteria. Table   2 reveals the docking results with the serine protease domain of the mammalians TMPRSS2. The best-docked compound in all the structures was Nafamostat (ZINC code 3874467), with a binding energy around -7.5 Kcal/mol. Furthermore, the binding pose of Nafamostat in each active site for the mammalian hosts TMPRSS2 is shown in Figure 5 (see also Figure S1 ). All compounds could produce pi-pi interactions and other electrostatic interactions allowing their position close to the catalytic residues (His296 and Ser441 in human). Thus, in theory, Nafamostat could interact with the mammalian TMPRSS2 and inhibit the proteolytic processing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.GRP78 is an ER chaperone that also has homeostatic functions by acting as a receptor in the cell membrane (Ge et al., 2019) . MERS and HKU9, a bat coronavirus, use this protein as a co-receptor to improve the attachment to the cell. Recent reports indicated that GRP78 could serve as a secondary receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we wanted to gain a deep understanding of GRP78 putative key role in host selectivity for SARS-CoV-2.First, we did a sequence alignment between GRP78 derived from the different hosts evaluated in this work. GRP78 exhibit a very high degree of conservation: except for some differences in the N-and C-terminal regions of the protein, not involved in the interaction with SARS-CoV-2, the proteins from different mammalian hosts exhibit more than 99% homology. In particular, the residues critical for the interaction with the spike were conserved in all the mammalian proteins ( Figure 6 ). Based on that, we employed the crystal structure for human GRP78 (PDB code 5E84) as a pattern to identify the binding site for the viral spike protein and its respective sequence and then to compare it to the other mammalian hosts. As shown in figure 7, GRP78 could be divided into three subunits: the alpha subdomain, the nucleotide-binding site, and the beta subdomain. Some reports established that the binding site for viral proteins is located in the beta subdomain. Our docking analysis confirmed that the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein could bind to the beta region with a binding energy around -14 Kcal/mol. The main residues and the binding pose are shown in Figure 7 and Table S5 . Moreover, this study performed a sequence analysis of the binding site for GRP78 to compare if there could occur any change affecting the viral spike protein binding. Our results pointed out that GRP78 displays a high homology sequence, over 95%, in this region.SARS-CoV-2 gains access to the cell through interactions with the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface (Ortega et al., 2020 . Some studies argue that interaction with ACE2 is the most important factor to determine host selectivity (Demogines et al., 2012 , Li 2013 , Shang et al., 2020 . As for SARS-CoV, mice cannot be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Hela cells transfected with mice ACE2 do not support SARS-CoV-2 replication (Zhou et al., 2020) . However, if mice are genetically modified and express the human ACE2 receptor they become permissive to the infection (Bao et al., 2020; Dediego et al., 2008) . Consequently, studying the interaction between the residues present in ACE2 and the viral spike protein may help us to understand better the factor associated with the host infection. Our sequence analysis of the ACE2 enzyme of several mammalian hosts showed substitution of specific amino acids residues of the contact region and particularly of those residues involved in the recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain. The significance of the amino acid substitution of key residues Lys31, Glu35, Asp38, Met82, and Lys353 (from the human cell receptor) in the recognition of viral spike protein on ACE2 from several mammals, including bats, have been previously pointed out (Hou et al., 2010; Luan et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020) . This study evaluated the ACE2 protein for humans, mice, pigs, cats, and dogs. These proteins display a homology over 80% and in the interacting domain around 70% in comparison to the human counterpart. Our docking analysis showed that the viral spike protein could interact with all ACE2 proteins evaluated with a binding energy around -13Kcal/mol with the higher binding energy (lees stable complexes) for ACE 2 from mice and pig, in agreement with their no susceptibility to this infection. Nonetheless, a lower binding energy (more stable complex) was achieved with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ACE2 from dogs. Meanwhile, the highest binding energy was detected with ACE2 from mice. Interestingly, neither mice nor pig could be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and dogs have low susceptibility. These results are in agreement with previous reports for the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein and these hosts (Luan et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020) . The non-synonymous changes in mice and dogs ACE2 sequences reduce the hydrogen bonds between the α1 and α2 helixes and the viral spike. Thus, we proceeded to evaluate the permissive hosts, humans, cats, and ferrets. Some differences were found in terms of ionic interactions, between mice, dogs, and pigs (salt bridges, N-O pair, and long-range interactions) related to changes in some residues. In the human complex four ionic pairs are observed (a strong salt bridge and three long-range interactions); also, in cats and ferrets four ionic pairs are present. In non-permissive or less permissive species, only three of these ionic pairs are preserved. Altogether, the hydrogen bonds in the interface and the presence of ionic pairs between ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexes appear to be an important stabilization factor.The interaction with ACE2 seems essential for host selectivity. Nevertheless, the low-level expression of ACE2 in lungs compared to other tissues, such as the small intestine or colon, suggest that the virus uses other secondary receptors, increasing the probability to interact with ACE2 (Fagerberg et al., 2014) . Recently, it was described that GRP78 could act as a secondary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (Ibrahim et al., 2020) . Also, this receptor had been reported as a secondary receptor for other coronaviruses (Chu et al., 2018) . After the coronavirus spike protein interacts with ACE2 receptor occurs the formation of an endocytic vacuole. Subsequently, the viral spike protein is cleaved by TMPRSS2 and the fusion motif is exposed, allowing the fusion between viral and lysosome membranes and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the release of viral RNA into the cytoplasm (Fehr and Perlman, 2015; Millet and Whittaker, 2015) . These early stages in viral infection are essential to allow the virus infection in a specific host. However, less is known about whether TMPRSS2 and/or GRP78 may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 permissiveness in other hosts, modulating its viral infectivity. Some reports showed that TMPRSS2 is a host factor essential for pneumotropism and pathogenicity of H7N9 and H1N1 influenza virus in mice by cleaving of the hemagglutinin (Tarnow et al., 2014) . Of note, SARS-Cov-2 can use both cathepsins and TMPRSS2 to prime the S protein for cell entry, depending on the target cell type, but only TMPRSS2 is required for SARS-Cov-2 infection of primary human lung cells (Hoffmann, 2020) . Thus, as for H7N9 and H1N1, TMPRSS2 play main role in SARS-CoV2 activation in the lungs. In this study, was analyzed the TMPRSS2 protease in the different mammalian hosts through sequence analysis and structural modeling. Curiously, this protein appears to be conserved in these host species. The homology was around 70% compared to humans. Benzoic acid derivatives as Camostat mesylate or Nafamostat can block the human protease in vitro and in vivo. Indeed, previous reports demonstrated that Camostat could block the entry of SARS- CoV-2 (Hoffman et al., 2020) . Currently, clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of these compounds against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo (Clinicaltrials.gov code NCT04321096, NCT04353284, NCT04353284). Since the proteases evaluated here exhibit a high homology in the active site, these compounds could block TMPRSS2 by a similar mechanism. Our molecular docking results showed that Nafamostat was the best-docked compound in the catalytic site of the mammalian TMPRSS2. SARS-CoV-2 can infect cats and, with low permissiveness, dogs thus these domestic animals could play an important role as reservoirs of the virus. The fact that TMPRSS2 is being evaluated as a possible alternative therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 let J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f us hypothesize that these proteases could be evaluated as targets in these intermediary hosts. These therapeutic options may have a significant impact on the pandemic control.Modulating the viral replication through cell targets would have several advantages in the development of new therapeutic agents (Ortega et al., 2013) . Besides, understanding if other host factors produce an increase or decrease in the susceptibility/infectivity to SARS-CoV-2 could help us identify new therapeutic targets.For its part, GRP78 was described recently as a possible secondary receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In theory, this receptor helps the virus to concentrate on the cell membrane and then interact with ACE2. This protein was also assessed in this work as a possible key factor in host selectivity. The sequence analysis demonstrated that this receptor is also highly conserved in mammalians. In fact, the region that was reported as a possible binding site for SARS-CoV-2 exhibit over 95% homology between all mammal species examined. Therefore, in theory, SARS-CoV-2 could interact with GRP78 in all these hosts, enhancing its interaction with ACE2.Collectively, the results present in this work help to clarify some important aspects related to SARS-CoV-2 host susceptibility. These findings contribute to explain the infection events that occurred recently in some pets and additionally to identify possible therapeutic targets. These targets would also help to control the pandemic distribution in intermediary hosts like cats and dogs.Finally, one interesting outcome of this work was related to the dog infection permissiveness. Sequence analysis and docking results showed that this host could be infected. However, the available in vivo data indicate that this host has low susceptibility . Thus, changes or variation in other secondary receptors (such as integrin Sigrist et al., 2020 and/or CD147, Wang et al., 2020 or cellular restriction factors associated with the immune innate response could be related to this low susceptibility. Therefore, we need further studies to understand better the early stages of this viral infection and the role of the host restriction factors. Altogether, this novel knowledge about the virus biology will contribute to propose new therapeutic targets. Furthermore, our investigation enhances the search for other putative targets that may have a significant impact on the control of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.Hector Rangel: Conceptualization, data curation, investigation, methodology, validation, writing-review and editing.

18cde6f57bf1d150b7d21caaea10745fca6853c5,ARTICLE IN PRESS COVID-19 in hematology: data from a hematologic and transplant unit,"Since all the world has been facing COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about hematological patients have been addressed. 1, 2 New diagnosis of acute or chronic leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma is still being made, and patients must go on in their treatments to maintain response and prognosis. There are few reports about hematologic patients and COVID-19 until now, but they reported more severe disease in this population. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The rationale is that hematologic cancer confers immunosuppression by itself or by its treatment, and it is already known that the development of any severe infection can modify the treatment schedule, impacting prognosis. Another special issue in COVID-19 scenario is about the access and the quality care of cancer therapy since there are overcrowded hospitals and deficiencies in blood supplies.COVID-19 was first noted in Brazil at the end of February, and a few days after, community transmission was documented. In the last two months, it spread to all Brazilian regions. Brazil faces severe difficulty in access diagnosis tests for all, so testing has been used mostly for individuals in risk group conditions, health care professionals, or patients who require hospitalizations. 8 In this manuscript, we address our preparation to face the COVID-19 pandemic during the first two months and describe COVID-19 documented cases in patients and health care workers (HCW): from diagnosis to outcomes.This is a case series study from hematological patients treated from March 12 th to May 21 th in Complexo Hospitalar de Niterói, a quaternary level hospital, reference for stem cell transplantation (SCT), and solid organ transplant in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study period coincides with the first 2 months after the documentation of community transmission of COVID-19 in Brazil. The hospital has a SCT Program since 2007 and performs a median of 100 autologous and 30 allogeneic SCT (related and unrelated) per year. The transplant unit (UTX) has 26 HEPA filtered single-room beds and receives patients for SCT and also hematological patients for chemotherapy and immunotherapy. A Day-Clinic hospital with 15 beds also integrates the unit. This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (number 30907420.1.0000.5455).Since WHO declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern in January 31 th , the Transplant Unit planned modifications regarding daily routines, in addition to intense modifications in all hospital. After WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, a COVID-19 Committee was formed to coordinate all actions and specific areas for COVID-19 patients where delimited, intended not to permit crossover of COVID-19 and other patients. Regarding the Transplant Unit, hematology staff, transplant infectious diseases specialist, and transplant coordination have generated guidelines to best balance the risk of baseline malignancies with the risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality. International and National recommendations were references for our actions, as well as reports from other transplant centers that had previously faced COVID-19. Care modifications included inpatients and outpatients; transplant indication timing; blood cell supply; and intensive care unit. Firstly, we focused on patient and family education about the importance of social distancing, hand hygiene, and masking. Written material was distributed to all. Restriction in people circulation inside the UTX has been applied, and several modifications were implemented before and ongoing the pandemic weeks. We limited inpatients caregiver to one, and visitors are strictly limited.UTX entrance has been confined to a single point, where all patients, families, and HCW are screened regarding symptoms and exposition. Patients with any symptoms regarding COVID-19 are masked and transferred to a specific Emergency Room to be tested. HCW or families that are symptomatic are not allowed to enter the Unit.Since the beginning of the program, medical staffs' surveillance of respiratory symptoms was intensified and testing all symptomatic has been routine.Regarding patients care, all admissions of SCT, donor and recipient, scheduled chemotherapy, or unscheduled admissions such as febrile neutropenia, and others have been clinical and laboratory screened by SARS-CoV-2 PCR.We gave continued training regarding secure, IPE, hospital and transplant flows, intubation, and others for all staff, and relevant data have been shared with all.For this analysis, epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data from COVID-19 cases were reviewed, and the outcome described. For HCW, we performed a web questionnaire. This questionnaire was applied twice, with 30 days apart, to identify COVID-19 cases.Data were reported as frequencies, proportions, or medians. The chi-squared test was applied to compare frequencies and rates. Kaplan-Meir was applied to survival analyses, and curves were compared by log-rank. We defined a statistically significant p-value lower than 0.05.A total of 47 onco-hematologic patients were tested for COVID-19 in the Unit. The screening was performed using SARS-CoV2 PCR for all cases. The test was applied to 30 symptomatic and 17 asymptomatic patients. Screened asymptomatic patients were: SCT donors (n = 4), SCT recipients (n = 10), hematological patients before scheduled chemotherapy (n = 3). No positive test was noted in asymptomatic screening, but only in symptomatic patients (10 cases; 33% of symptomatic; 21% of all tested). A COVID-19 case performed the test in other hospital, but she was transferred to our hospital to treatment.Screening was done in 54 health care workers: 40 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic justified by exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Only symptomatic HCW tested positive (28 cases; 70% of symptomatic, 52% of tested). Frequencies of COVID-19 in tested and symptomatic HCW were higher compared to hematological patients (52% vs. 21%; p = 0.003 and 70% vs. 33%; p = 0.005; respectively).Eleven onco-hematological patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, including two recipients of haploidentical stem cell transplant (both late phase post SCT -after D + 100), and 9 patients with onco-hematological malignancies. Clinical and laboratory data are shown in Table 1 .Regarding haploidentical patients, they were treating chronic severe GVHD at the moment of COVID-19, and immunosuppression included corticosteroids. Regarding onco-hematological patients, two episodes of COVID-19 were noted in untreated newly diagnosed patients. Most cases were moderate or severe (n = 9; 82%), and 5 (45%) died due to COVID-19. One patient is still on treatment, but recovering. The timeline of COVID-19 cases is represented in Fig. 1A .Our first case of COVID-19 in hematological patients was documented on March 30 th , in another hospital, and the number of cases increased after April 15 th . Three patients developed COVID during hospitalization, but in two, a close relative was the probable source of infection. In the other patient, the source could be intrahospital. In all the others, COVID-19 symptoms were present at hospitalization, and the patient was treated outside UTX. Regarding HCW, COVID-19 cases started earlier comparing to hematological patients, but most HCW cases occurred after the second week of April, with a cluster distribution of thirteen cases in 2 weeks. (Fig. 1B) After this cluster, training and screening were intensified, and universal use of masks during all hospital stay, including HCW common areas, was then implemented. HCW cases still occurred but in more regular distribution during weeks. Fig. 2.1 shows the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in HCW, and Fig. 2 .2, the incidence by professional categories (p = 0.13).The spread in number of COVID-19 in hematological patients and in HCW after second week of April is similar to cases distribution in Rio de Janeiro State during the same period (Fig. 3) .During the same two months, a total of 61 hematological patients were admitted in the UTX. Autologous and allogeneic SCT was performed in eight and four patients, respectively. Despite two autologous patients (admission in UTX occurred before the documentation of community transmission in Brazil), all recipients and donors were screened by SARS-CoV-2 PCR before admission or stem cell harvest. No COVID-19 was observed in SCT during the early phase.Our experience during the initial months of COVID-19 pandemic highlighted some observations: COVID-19 presents as moderate or severe cases in onco-hematological patients, and the mortality was high. High intensively treated patients or those with comorbidities were at worse risk for severe COVID. A large proportion of HCW experienced COVID-19, independently of the category of professionals. We could observe a cluster of COVID-19 in HCW, suggesting possible transmission within HCW. After intensified measures, the spread of cases in patients and HCW were similar to those reported in our State, and the Unit was maintained as a ""COVID-19 free zone"". Regardless of the pandemic, the transplant program was continued but had a 50% reduction in autologous transplants procedures. Regarding allogeneic, we did not experience a reduction in transplants procedures. This workforce priories the importance of keep cancer treatment going, and so mitigate the impact of postponing SCT in high risk cancer patients.The knowledge of COVID-19 is in progression. The disease was first documented a few months ago but is now spreading worldwide. Description of manifestations and outcomes from specific sub-settings of patients is a mandatory issue for a better understanding of this new pathology and provides tools to face it. [10] [11] [12] [13] Few reports addressed hematological patients. Data from China and France reported concerning outcomes: 85% and 40% mortality rates among hematological patients, respectively. 3, 4 Most patients had other comorbidities despite hematological cancer, and the COVID-19 manifestation was frequently severe, requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care in a high proportion of cases from both series. Data from Italy, including solid tumor patients, showed better outcomes than China and France series, but all authors concluded that COVID-19 has a worse evolution in cancer patients compared to non-cancer population. 5, 6 In our series, the mortality rate was similar to France reports. We also find poor laboratory markers and severe pulmonary involvement at the onset of severe diseases.On the other hand, mild and moderate cases at onset had uncomplicated evolution. It is important to address that their and our cases were all symptomatic patients that had a documented COVID-19. It is a crucial bias since asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic cases are not documented unless they require medical assistance or hospitalization for other reasons. There is a possible overestimation of complications and mortality rates.Regarding HCW, we report a high incidence of COVID-19 regardless of the professional category, and we were unable to establish an association with work characteristics such as frequency and work in more than one hospital. HCW cases increased concomitantly with cases in our State, but we could observe a cluster at the beginning of transmission. This fact suggests that a possible transmission within HCW happened, as all COVID-19 onco-hematological patients were managed outside the UTX, and no case in the hospitalized patient was identified in the same period. The COVID-19 rate in HCW was higher than some reports from Italy, 5,14 but similar to first reports from China. 15 Cluster distribution was also noted in Singapore and China. 16, 17 HCW is considered a high-risk group for infection and transmission, but fortunately most cases were mild. 18 This high incidence of COVID-19 in HCW highlighted the importance of intense screening, regular training, and adequate personal protective equipment to limit the spread and to reduce the risk for HCW to become infected. Any symptoms or suspected community exposition should be managed as a possible case, and the HCW must be removed from work until appropriate documentation. The frequency of testing positive was 70% in symptomatic HCW, a very high proportion compared to symptomatic onco-hematologic patients. Although, we did not find COVID-19 documentation in asymptomatic HCW, pre-symptomatic transmission is of great concern. Impact of asymptomatic HCW screening is not clear, but measures to reduce pre-symptomatic transmission must be implemented. 16 Despite the pandemic, transplant programs from other countries maintained the program active, as postponing transplantation is not feasible in some scenarios. The European Society for Blood Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and The Brazilian Society for Blood Marrow Transplantation (SBTMO) recommendations allow procedures if the patients' safety is maintained. 19, 20 We decided to maintain the program active but limited the procedure to those in which the prognosis would be impacted by postponing transplantation. This decision was based on an intense collaboration of the institution as a whole and revised with daily results. 10, 21 Asia, Europe, and North America are in a different pandemic phase compared to Brazil. These regions are reopening, but Brazil has not achieved the peak of incidence yet and has an increasing number of infected and deaths daily. Unfortunately, all the world is exposed to second or more waves of COVID-19, until an efficient vaccine is available. SARS-CoV-2 will remain a concern for a long time. We hope our experience may contribute to a better comprehension of the disease in the onco-hematological scenario and improve the capacity to mitigate the negative impact in cancer care assistance during the Pandemic.",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-06,9
b935cf441b3c29f95f980dadbe244c6968bcd465,"A multipurpose machine learning approach to predict COVID-19 negative prognosis in São Paulo, Brazil Cristiane Esteves Teixeira 1,4","The COVID-19 epidemic that first appeared in Wuhan, China, has rapidly spread worldwide and still continues to affect most countries, through late initial infections 1,2 and second waves 3, 4 . Currently, there have been more than 14 million cases and five hundred and ninety thousand confirmed deaths 5 . In critical patients, the disease has been shown to rapidly worsen a few days after infection 6, 7 requiring immediate clinical decisions, especially in developing countries with limited resources 8, 9 . An accurate COVID-19 prognosis assessment is crucial for screening and treatment procedures and may increase patient survival 10, 11 .The consequences of COVID-19 have been disastrous for health systems in middle and low-income countries (LMICs) 12 , especially in Brazil 13 . The lack of established knowledge about the disease has made it difficult to identify risk criteria to support clinical conducts and to allocate human and physical resources in health facilities and hospitals 14 . Currently, many Brazilian cities are at their saturation capacity for the provision of clinical care, especially regarding ICU beds and mechanical ventilators 15, 16 .Previous studies have used blood tests 17 , CT images 18, 19 , sociodemographic and comorbidities history 20 to develop COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic models, including machine learning techniques [21] [22] [23] . Biomarkers from blood tests have emerged as important variables for poor prognostic factors 24 , which are a promising tool in poorer regions, due to its low cost and inclusion in standard protocols for clinical care. However, the majority of studies 25 rely on algorithms trained on a single prognostic outcome, which in theory require the training of specific algorithms for each distinct negative outcome.Five of the most popular machine learning models for structured data (artificial neural networks 27 , extra trees 28 , random forests 29 , catboost 30 , and extreme gradient boosting 31 ) were trained with 70% of the data, and tested in the other 30%, simulating new unknown data. All the results reported in this study are from the test set. K-fold cross-validation with 10 folds was used to adjust the hyperparameters with Bayesian optimization (HyperOpt). Due to the unbalanced nature of the outcomes, random undersampling was performed in the training set, by randomly selecting examples from the majority class for exclusion. This technique was implemented using the RandomUnderSampler imbalanced-learn class 32 .To understand the individual contribution of each variable to the predictive models, we calculated their respective Shapley values. All the analyzes were performed using the Python programming language with the scikit-learn library.We analyzed the predictive performance of the algorithms for three negative prognostic outcomes: ICU admission (n=263, 25.5%), mechanical ventilation (MV) intubation (n=106, 10.2%) and death (n=92, 9.4%). We first tested the predictive performance of the machine learning algorithms for a specific individual outcome (e.g. death). We then used the other two outcomes (in this specific example, mechanical ventilation and ICU admission) to train another model, and then tested this model performance to predict the previous outcome (death). We then compared the performance of the two strategies using the 95% confidence interval of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).The Braden score played an important role in the aggregated outcome algorithms, ranking as the most important predictor in two of three models. Also, the Creactive protein and ratio of lymphocytes per C-reactive protein proved to be good predictors, appearing in the top 5 in all three models. Urea, age, creatinine, and arterial lactate were important for only one of the aggregated models.We found that machine learning algorithms were able to predict with high overall performance negative prognostic outcomes for COVID-19, even when the specific outcome was not included in the training of the algorithms. All models presented an AUROC higher than 0.91 (average of 0.92) in the test set, with high sensitivity and specificity (average of 0.92 and 0.82, respectively). The results highlight the possibility that high-performance machine learning algorithms are able to predict unspecific negative COVID-19 outcomes using routinely-collected data.Brazil is currently the second country in the world in total number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 33 . There is a growing demand in Brazil, and in many other developing countries, for decision support in the allocation of scarce hospital resources, especially in relation to the availability of ICU beds and mechanical ventilators 34, 35 . From a clinical standard, knowledge about immediate risks of negative prognosis can also contribute to the early start of preventive measures and new interventions, and thereby increase patient survival 10, 11 .The study has a few limitations that need to be mentioned. First, some of the outcomes overlap which may have helped the performance of the aggregated models, even though in the majority of cases the outcomes were independent. In the case of ICU admission, 55% of the patients did not die or used MV, while in the case of MV and death, 63% and 70% of their respective aggregated model was trained on other outcomes. Ideally, the outcomes would never overlap, but this is clinically unfeasible given the interlaced nature of negative prognostic outcomes. Another limitation is that we analyzed data from an urban COVID-19 hotspot in Brazil, in a period where clinical protocols for the disease were still being established, so this could affect the incidence of prognostic outcomes and may not directly generalize to other periods.In conclusion, we found that machine learning algorithms can predict severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients with high performance, including previously unobserved outcomes, using only routinely-collected laboratory, clinical and demographic data. The use of multipurpose algorithms for the prediction of overall negative prognosis is a promising new area that can support doctors with clinical and administrative decisions, especially regarding priorities for hospital admission and monitoring.All the code written to process and analyze the data can be made available upon request to the corresponding author.

[1] The disease was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China, on 1 December, 2019, and the first case was reported on 31 December of the same year. [2, 3] It is believed that the virus has a zoonotic origin because the first confirmed cases were mainly linked to the Huanan Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals. [4] [5] [6] On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic. [7.8] In Brazil, the emergency alert was raised to level 2 (out of 3) on 28 January 2020, meaning it was considered an 'imminent danger' to the country. [9] The notification of cases of COVID-19 is managed by the Integrated Health Surveillance Platform of Ministry of Health. We currently have had 3,501,975 cases and 112,304 deaths in Brazil. [10] Prevention measures are highly important to poor communities because surveillance and access to health care may be limited. [11] However, preventive measures such as frequent hand hygiene and social distancing are suboptimal in these populations. The lack of water and cleaning products hinders frequent hand washing and sanitizing of objects. [12] [13] [14] A modelling study concluded that social distancing in a respiratory virus pandemic is 60 to 70% less effective in reducing the attack rate in an underdeveloped population than in a developed population. [15] This lower effectiveness is attributed to greater numbers of people in the same household, which imply a higher proportion of intradomicile transmissions of the virus -which are not prevented by social distancing -out of the total transmissions. [15] In addition, low-income individuals may be more averse to social distancing due to the need to work to provide food for their families, their lower flexibility in finding/changing jobs, their fear of losing their jobs, and their lack of formal jobs with working conditions set by law. [12] [16, 17] The lack of knowledge about the disease may also cause lower adherence to prevention measures. Knowledge about the disease is positively correlated with education and the adoption of prevention practices for both COVID-19 [18] and other diseases caused by respiratory viruses. [19.20] There are several strategies to control an outbreak: containment, mitigation, and suppression. The containment measures are performed in the early stages of the outbreak and aim to locate and quarantine cases of infection, in addition to vaccination and other measures to control the infection to stop it spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, the measures focus on delaying and mitigating its effects on society and the health system. Containment and mitigation measures can be performed simultaneously. [21] Suppression measures require that more extreme measures be taken to reverse the pandemic by decreasing the reproductive number to less than 1. [22] Part of the management of an outbreak of an infectious disease consists of trying to reduce the epidemiological peak, a process called 'flattening the epidemiological curve'. [23] This reduces the risk of overburdening health services and gives more time for new vaccines and treatments to be developed.Among the non-pharmacological interventions that control the outbreak are personal prevention measures, such as washing hands, wearing face masks, and voluntary quarantine; community prevention measures, such as closing schools and cancelling events that gather large numbers of people; environmental measures, such as cleaning and disinfecting surfaces; and measures that promote social adherence to these interventions. [24] Among the suppression measures taken in some countries are quarantines of several cities, travel bans, [25] mass screening, financial support for infected individuals so they isolate themselves, fines for those who break isolation, criminalization of stocking up on medical materials, [26] and compulsory reporting of flu-like symptoms.This study aimed establish measures to contain and suppress the spread of COVID-19, associated with education, active case tracking, and humanitarian aid in two needy communities in the metropolitan region of Curitiba, Brazil, involving medical students from the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR) and volunteers. It also aimed to verify the effects of these measures on the outcome of adherence to the measures and evolution of the number of cases detected during the project. The general idea was to conduct a programme that could be globally reproduced and applied in any pandemic outbreak in fragile communities based on two basic and non-exclusive principles: education and humanitarian aid.The target population of the present interventional study consisted of needy populations from the periphery of the municipalities of Curitiba (Caximba neighbourhood) and Araucária (Jardim Israelense neighbourhood), totalling 350 families (approximately 1,300 participants).The Caximba community is located south of Curitiba. It has a population of predominantly European origin and an area of 8.22 km 2 . [27] In 1989, a sanitary landfill was created in this region, which received waste from Curitiba and the metropolitan region. [28] After the landfill stopped being used in mid-2009, 'Vila 29 de Outubro' was formed, the largest village in the region of the Caximba neighbourhood. Considered an irregular settlement area, since the land belongs to the Institute of Waters of Paraná, the community was built on flooded land, without basic sanitation. [29] At least 1.1 thousand families inhabit these places unfit for dwelling. [30] The Caximba neighbourhood has 767 households, with an average of 3.29 inhabitants per household. This makes this community more crowded than Curitiba, which has an average of 2.76 inhabitants per household. [27] Thus, the site highlights the risk of spreading infectious diseases. In addition, only 4.44% of the households of this neighbourhood are connected to the general sewage network, raising the propensity to spread diseases that involve intestinal transmission. [27] In the Capela Velha neighbourhood of Araucária, there are two large communities that were formed by land invasion: the Jardim Israelense community and 21 de Outubro community. Capela Velha is to the northwest Araucária and has approximately 25,000 inhabitants, 3.1% of whom are over 65 years old. [31] The 21 de Outubro community was established in a portion of the Jardim Israelense affected by flooding near the Passaúna River dam. More than 300 families lived in this flooded portion until the Jardim Arvoredo II subdivision was completed, enabling approximately 170 families to be relocated. [32] Data from the Department of Planning of the Araucária city hall show the poverty of the region: 60% of the residents have an income between one and two minimum wages and 13% of the residents an income below that amount. [33] The patient care, educational procedures, and collection were done by students enrolled in health and medical courses of the medical schools of Curitiba and other volunteers.The following procedures were performed: 1) Collection of epidemiological data from the studied populations as well as data on their knowledge of COVID-192) Performance of rapid tests on people from the community who had symptoms (suspicions) and their contacts. The tests were immunochromatography (intravenous blood collection and local verification of IgG/IgM positivity), which is indicated for patients with more than 10 days of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and RT-PCR, which is indicated for people with suspected active COVID-19 for less than 7 days.3) Provision of scientific information and answering the population's questions through audio-visual materials and educational pamphlets written in colloquial language, produced by the group of volunteers and distributed in the course of their activities. 4) Provision of food parcels, masks, hygiene, and cleaning materials directly to family nuclei to reduce the need for residents to go outside the community in search of humanitarian aid.A questionnaire was applied in the form of a direct interview in the case of people with restricted or non-existent access to the Internet. For others, the questionnaire was published on the Google Forms platform, and its content was divided into three blocks:A total of 255 people were included in the study. Each one represented a family registered for the project. A total of 79.6% (203) were women and 20.4%The monthly family income varied between zero and two minimum wages. A total of 7.4% (19) of the people reported not having a family income at the time, 54.5% (139) had a family income less than or equal to half the minimum wage, 29% (74) had a family income greater than half the minimum wage but less than or equal to one minimum wage, and 6.3% (16) had a family income greater than one but less than or equal to two minimum wages. The Among the people who reported leaving the community, 43.9% (29) mentioned essential purchases -food and alcohol, for example -and 18.2% (12) mentioned work as a reason. A total of 33.3% (22) of the people who regularly left the community took public transportation. A total of 81.8% (206) answered that they could stay at home for 14 days in case of suspected or confirmed COVID-19.The mean number of COVID-19 symptoms correctly cited by the interviewees increased from 2.16 on the first test to 2.37 on the second test [ Table 4 ]. The most cited were fever (from 66.3% to 72.5%), body pain (from 51.4% to 48.2%), dyspnoea (from 56.5% to 47.5%), and cough (from 40.4% to 43.5%). On the first test, 27.5% of people cited symptoms that are not commonly found in COVID-19, and 4.3% of people said they did not know any symptoms. In the second test, these percentages were 10.6% and 5.1%, respectively. A total of 47.5% of people at the time of the first test and 62.7% at the time of the second test knew that they would need to be quarantined for 14 days if they presented symptoms of COVID-19.The proportion of respondents who knew they did not need medical care Although most of the people interviewed had no income or had an income less than one minimum wage, most had access to TV and social media, such as Facebook and Instagram, and obtained most of their information about COVID-19 from TV shows or national television news or from social media ( Table 2 ). The application created by the Ministry of Health was rarely cited, and only one person accessed pandemic information through this public website.This demonstrates that public initiatives in Brazil need to be better publicized by the government to the poorest sections of the population.As documented in the initial interviews and in the reapplication of the survey, most residents were already afraid to leave the community, and in general, they only did so for work reasons or to make purchases essential to their family's subsistence. This facilitated our educational goal of emphasizing the need for residents to remain in the community during the pandemic.",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-29,9
f37d65561ea15519b46267050c9249cc1e2d1ab2,"HOW SUPER-SPREADER CITIES, HIGHWAYS, HOSPITAL BED AVAILABILITY, AND DENGUE FEVER INFLUENCED THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC IN BRAZIL","Barely 6 months after its first report of a COVID-19 case, on February 26, 2020, Brazil recorded the staggering tally of more than 4,000,000 cases and 125,000 deaths [1] as a consequence of the rampant SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that raged through the entire country. Those numbers ensure that, by September 16 th , Brazil was the third most affected country in the world, right behind the United States and India in terms of both accumulated COVID-19 cases, and second only to the US in terms of deaths [1].By early March, it became clear that the country's international airports, located mainly in large state capital cities on the Brazilian Atlantic coast (with only three main exceptions: Brasilia, Belo Horizonte and Manaus) had been the main entry points of SARS-CoV-2 into the country [2] . However, despite the fact that the main genotypes arriving and spreading through the country were rapidly identified [3] , the routes taken by SARS-CoV-2 to reach the entire Brazilian territory remained mysterious until now. In addition, the heavily skewed and heterogeneous spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases throughout the country's five official regions (North (NO), Northeast (NE), Central-West (CO), Southeast (SE) and South (S)), even after six months of an out of control epidemic, as well as the discrepancy between cases and death distributions caught our attention ( Figure 1 ). The focus of this study, therefore, was identifying the key factors that could account for these uneven spatial distributions and, as a second step, explaining how the five Brazilian regions, or even individual states, exhibited quite remarkable differences in key epidemiological indicators (e.g. incidence, rate of growth, date of arrival of cases, and mortality) during the first 6 months of the SARS-CoV-2 Brazilian epidemic. Table 2 ).Next, we focused on identifying the major Brazilian cities contributing to COVID-19 case spread through the Brazilian highway grid. Mathematical modeling (see Methods) revealed that, during the first 3 weeks of the epidemic (from the last week of February to mid-March), by itself the city of São Paulo, which is situated near the largest Brazilian international airport and is responsible for the highest highway traffic flow in the country, was responsible for the spread of more than 80% of the original cases that found their way throughout Brazil (Figure 2A) . Because of such a staggering initial contribution, and the fact that it never dropped below 30% for the next 3 months, São Paulo clearly became the main Brazilian super-spreader city of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.Boomerangs were so pervasive throughout the country that they triggered major surges in hospital admissions in most state capitals in all Brazilian regions (see yellow highlights in Fig. 3B ), leading to peaks of lethality in each of these cities ( Figure 3B ). Moreover, the boomerang flow was not restricted to roads and highways. For instance, in the Amazon rain forest, severely ill people were transported by boats of all sorts using the large rivers of the North region, from many small riverside communities, towards the two largest Amazon cities, Manaus and Belém (see Figure 3A ).After ruling out a series of other factors, we decided to search the Brazilian Ministry of Health databases and its regular epidemiological bulletins for any potential interfering factors that could account for this peculiar skewed shape. Figure 5B -C and B'-C' reveals the rather surprising finding of our search. In Figure 5A and A' we reproduce the Brazilian map with the distribution of COVID-19 cases ( Figure 5A ) and incidence ( Figure 5A ') by municipality on June 31st. Next to it, we display the Brazilian maps depicting the spatial distributions of confirmed dengue fever cases (1,337,095 in 2020) and incidence in 2020 ( Figure 5B and B'), and the total sum of dengue cases (3,585,665 cases) and incidence for 2019-2020 ( Figure 5C and C') for all Brazilian towns.Visual inspection of these maps clearly indicated that they were complementary;As a control measure, we repeated all the above analysis (see Figure 6E To further investigate the potential relationship between dengue fever and COVID-19, we plotted the incidence of COVID-19 versus dengue in 2020, for all 5,570 Brazilian cities; all together ( Figure 6G ) and according to the specific region to which they belonged, such as the North (Fig. 6H) , Northeast (Fig. 6I) , Southeast (Fig. 6J) , Center-West, (Fig.   6K ), and South region (Fig. 6L) ). These latter scatter plots revealed a clear inverse pattern of interaction for each region with clear interregional differences. For instance, while the NO states had a larger proportion of cities with very high COVID-19 incidence, and very low dengue incidence, the CO states had a distribution that was the mirror opposite: a much larger number of cities with high dengue incidence and lower COVID-19 cases.To further quantify the inverse relationship between COVID-19 and dengue fever incidence, we selected a subset of 799 cities from all regions and tried to describe their relationship using a hyperbolic function (see Methods for details, Figure 6G '). The fitting of a hyperbolic function was very significant (r = 0.72, p = 0.0001). A similar hyperbolic fitting was also obtained for a sample of 1,466 cities (r = 0.55, p = 0.0001).Overall, we identified four major factors that concurrently accounted for most of the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. From its original entry at all major Brazilian international airports during the month of March [2] , SARS-CoV-2 spread first to the large metropolitan areas of state capitals located next to these airports. From that point on, after community transmission was established and began to rise exponentially in these cities, and given that no major road blocks were implemented during the early months of the epidemic, a small group of these large cities began spreading SARS-CoV-2 to the entire country, through the extensive highway grid that covers all of Brazil. By itself, São Paulo, the city with highest population in Brazil, emerged as the country's super-spreader city par excellence, accounting for the largest case spreading influence throughout the next 3 months. A small set of other 16 spreading cities contributed to the seeding of initial cases throughout the whole country via a subset of 26 major federal highways. This highway-driven spread was the main mechanism through which initial cases arrived in all Brazilian cities. Thus, in about 30 days SARS-CoV-2 was transported to all five regions of the country, across the north-south axis, a distance of roughly 5,313 kilometers.The Brazilian federal health care system, known as the ""Sistema Único de Saúde"" (SUS; in English: Unified Health System) was created 32 years ago [12] with the mission to provide free health care to every Brazilian citizen anywhere in the country. Today, SUS constitutes the only option through which 7 out of 10 Brazilians have access to highquality medical care for free [13] . Yet, the COVID-19 epidemic crisis clearly exposed the inadequacy of the policy of concentrating the largest share of tertiary hospital facilities and ICU beds in a handful of mid-size towns and state capitals throughout Brazil. Although our study did not address this issue directly, its findings suggest that, had the geographic distribution of ICU beds been less skewed toward big cities, many more lives could have been saved throughout the country. Indeed, critically ill patients in less populated areas would have had regional access to ICU beds and therefore would have received quicker treatment and had a better chance for improved clinical outcomes. Regional access would also have reduced the demand on critical resources and specialized medical personnel necessary for transporting such seriously ill patients over long distances to metropolitan hospitals, eliminating the widespread boomerang effect documented here.In its official epidemiological bulletins issued regularly, the Brazilian Ministry of Health attributed the sudden decline in dengue cases to possible under-notification problems caused by the COVID-19 epidemic [18] . We, instead, propose that at least part of such precipitous drops in both dengue fever cases likely may reflect the fact that SARS-CoV-2 was rapidly outcompeting the dengue Flavivirus serotypes for infecting the same pool of susceptible people across Brazil. Essentially, if a subject became infected with SARS-CoV-2, he/she would not be infected by dengue viruses. Clearly, further epidemiological and immunological studies will be needed to test this hypothesis.This previously unknown ""dengue effect"" may explain, at least in part, why most mathematical modeling carried out in the early stages of the COVID-19 Brazilian epidemic were significantly off in their predictions of cases and deaths for the country [22, 23] . The same happened with predictions for countries in Africa and Southeast Asia. In the context of our findings, the explanation for this mismatch could be that previously acquired immunity for dengue fever may have protected people from contracting SARS-Cov-2.This was confirmed by the discovery of a highly significant, exponential inverse correlation between the incidence of dengue and COVID-19 when data from several countries in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and along the Pacific and Indian Oceans were pooled and analyzed together. Detailed analysis of these worldwide data will be covered in two other upcoming studies from our group.Since the IgM lifetime is so short, it seems logical to conclude, therefore, that the highly significant negative correlations we observed in Brazil, between state populations levels of dengue-induced IgM and several epidemiological indicators of COVID-19 infection, was at least concurrently paralleled by the production of higher titers of IgG antibodies in the dengue affected population. This seems to be confirmed by the fact that when we analyzed data from several countries around the world, high inverse correlations were found initially by using only 2019 dengue fever incidence data against 2020 COVID-19 incidence in each country. That further suggests that a single episode of dengue fever could suffice to generate some level of long-term, IgG-mediated cross-immunity to COVID-19.Heterologous immunity is a well-known phenomenon, particularly between closely related species of parasites, protozoa, bacteria and viruses [27] . However, it has also been documented between unrelated species. Indeed, this phenomenon led to the hypothesis that routine use of the bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine in certain countries could explain their lower incidence to a variety of viruses [28, 29] , and that the BCG-induced trained immunity could even offer a protection against COVID-19 [30].Cross-reactive specific antibodies, but also T cells, can underlie heterologous immunity [27] . For instance, pre-existing cross-reactivity, mediated by CD4 + T cells to SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in 25-50% of people not exposed to the new coronavirus [31, 32].Moreover, since no study so far has focused on the potential role of T cells in mediating cross-reactivity between the DENV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses, the level of heterologous immunity between these two viral families may be higher than shown by antibody-based studies. Thus, based on these preliminary reports and our own epidemiological findings, we postulate that cross-reactivity, both cellular and humoral, may occur between one or more DENV serotypes that cause dengue fever and COVID-19.Interestingly enough, a recent review by Henrina et al. [41] also highlights the enormous similarities between COVID-19 and dengue fever, not only in terms of clinical presentation, but more strikingly, in terms of their common pathophysiology (see Table 2 of Henrina et al., 2020). For instance, the so called cytokine storm syndrome, as well as widespread endothelium dysfunction, is present in severe cases of both COVID-19 and in the most serious clinical manifestation of dengue, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever [41] . Moreover, in both diseases, albeit through different mechanisms, D-dimer levels are elevated [41] , and may serve as an indicator of the severity of the clinical manifestation [41] .In the context of the worldwide health emergency created by the current coronavirus pandemic, our surprising results bring up the possibility that antibodies (or lymphocyte B and T cells) produced as a response to an episode of dengue fever may provide a certain level of immunological protection against COVID-19. That immediately raises the intriguing hypothesis that immunization for dengue fever could also induce some level of clinically significant immunological protection against SARS-CoV-2.When dengue hospitalizations were considered, TAK-003's efficiency reached 95.4% of the tested population [42] . TAK-003 was more effective (97.7%) for the DENV-2 serotype, but also moderately effective for the other three (73.7% for DENV-1, 63.2% for DENV-3, and inconclusive results of 63% for DENV-4). Finally, different from DengvaxiaTAK-003, Phase III data revealed an incidence of severe adverse effects similar to the control group [42] .Finally, it is worth speculating that, since other flaviviruses exist that generate human diseases, like Zika and yellow fever for instance, still unknown crossimmunological interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and other flaviviruses (or even other viruses, for that matter) may exist. Investigating and deciphering such interactions may be highly relevant for establishing other potentially useful emergency mitigation strategies for reducing the rate of growth of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For instance, since the traditional yellow fever vaccine is well-known and readily available worldwide, it would be interesting to investigate whether there is any cross-immunological interaction between the yellow fever virus and SARS-Cov-2 in subjects recently vaccinated against yellow fever. In case this is true, the yellow fever vaccine could also be considered as an emergency strategy to reduce the number of cases of COVID-19.As emphasized above, this and other potential emergency strategies will require further clinical studies to decide whether they constitute valid and safe clinical approaches to mitigate the human impact of the COVID-19 pandemic while there is no approved vaccine or therapy for dealing with SARS-CoV-2.We obtained data describing the temporal evolution of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Brazil at the municipal and state levels from several sources, including the Brazilian Ministry of Health [47], official daily epidemiological bulletins issued by each Brazilian State [48] , and other souces as compiled by Cota et al. [49] . Both cases and death data refer to notifications per day. To compute incidence (cases per 100,000 inhabitants), we used population size estimates for each of the 5,570 Brazilian municipalities for 2019 [50] . Such population size estimates were aggregated to allow the computation of COVID-19 at the state level.We also used the Ministry's data on Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) data, in which COVID-19 cases represents close to 98% of the data in 2020, to obtain detailed information about patients' residence and hospitalization location throughout Brazil (https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/bd-srag-2020). The SARI data contains only a subset of the official reported COVID-19 cases since they cover only hospitalized cases. Dengue epidemiological and serological data were provided by data published in the official epidemiological bulletins regularly during 2019 and 2020 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health.To investigate the most representative highways concerning the COVID-19 spatial The flux intensity parameter was set to s=1, that is, no compensation of the flux intensity was performed, and the real daily sampled movement counts were used to infer the mobility between cities. The code and mobility data are available at the GitHub repository https://github.com/pedrospeixoto/mdyn To ensure robustness, the interplay between COVID-19 and Flavivirus epidemics was analyzed considering several different viewpoints. Simple linear regression analysis was performed in most cases, considering exponential growth where appropriate. Also, for each state of the country, a log-log linear model was adjusted considering the period that goes from the observation of the 10th COVID-19 cases until 90 days afterwards.These models were adherent with at least a coefficient of determination of 0.95, providing a very good representation of the initial growth of the pandemic in each state. The slopes of these models, representing the initial growth rate of the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil, were used in the correlation analysis with the population levels of IgM for dengue fever in each state.Mobility data: The mobile mobility dataset was provided by Inloco MALN designed the study, collected and analyzed data, identified the ""boomerang effect discovered the interaction between COVID-19 and dengue fever, and wrote the paper.",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-21,9
d5fb0c55dbc17f4ce4054a992efe4983c06daaa9,Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical Early public research funding response to COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in Wuhan, China, after many cases with an unknown origin of pneumonia were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019 1 . As of May 31, 2020, more than 6 million confirmed cases and 370,000 related deaths have been reported worldwide 2 . The impact of COVID-19 on human health may range considerably from asymptomatic and mild cases to more critical situations in which severe respiratory failure is observed, primarily in older patients 3 .On the same day that the WHO declared COVID-19 a global public health emergency (January 30, 2020) 4 , the Brazilian Ministry of Health gathered a working group dedicated to monitoring and taking possible action against the disease 5 . As early as February 3, 2020, the Brazilian government declared a state of emergency 6 ; on February 6, 2020, there were nine suspected cases of COVID-19 7 . However, the authorities only confirmed the first case in São Paulo on February 26 8 , which is the biggest, most populous city in Brazil and also the capital of its namesake state. After 20 days, the first death caused by COVID-19 was also confirmed in São Paulo. Since then, the disease spread rapidly throughout the country. According to the official data, on May 31, 2020, there were 514,200 confirmed cases and 29,314 deaths 9 .Given that there are no vaccines and proven antivirals available yet 10 , one of the main strategies adopted by governments to manage the disease is related to the reduction of transmission rates, which seem to be elevated [11] [12] . These include social quarantining and lockdowns that, although somewhat controversial, are believed to reduce the need for medical assistance of many people at once [13] [14] . This is vital because patients needing intensive care can be given more attention and time is gained to increase available resources, such as necessary scientific evidence to fight the disease. In response to the pandemic, the scientific community has published numerous studies covering several areas of expertise. However, many questions and developments remain unanswered or unaccomplished.Science and technology research in Brazil has been conducted mainly by universities and research institutions, often in partnership with companies. Furthermore, research activities are partly (~50%) funded by the Brazilian government through public funding agencies 15 . Nationally, there are two federal agencies which give funding to researchers: the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)-associated with the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation, and Communications-and the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) of the Ministry of Education. Brazil is divided into five macroregions and is further divided into 27 federal units comprised of 26 States and one Federal District (Brasilia, the capital of Brazil). As such, besides the federal foundations, each federal unit has a specific public foundation, known as FAPs (State Research Support Foundations), responsible for providing grants for local research. For example, in São Paulo, the FAP is known as FAPESP (São Paulo Research Support Foundation). Accordingly, each FAP has a distinguished name. Therefore, at least two possible sources for public funding are available for researchers in Brazil, and public funding has been known to have a positive impact on research and development (R&D) production 16 . In this context, this study addresses the early public research funding for scientific investigations specifically against COVID-19 and its consequences in Brazil.The number of both accumulated and new cases and deaths confirmed in Brazil were obtained on May 1, 2020, from the official national data website (https://covid.saude.gov.br/). The data on the evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil was plotted using a graphic profile. Information related to public research funding for scientific investigations on COVID-19 and its consequences in Brazil from the first four months since the first case (between December 31, 2019, and May 1, 2020) was collected. Public research funding information was collected from the official websites of CAPES and CNPq for national data and FAPs for regional data. Only funding opportunities with official public notice were considered to obtain complete information. Furthermore, they were only contemplated if funded exclusively with national resources. The total amount to be invested by each public research funding agency versus the announcement date was then plotted. All areas of interest for the agencies described in the financing documents were identified. A graph of the total number of occurrences by area was plotted. Finally, the general panorama of Brazilian public research funding during the COVID-19 outbreak was discussed. As reference numbers, data of the federal unit gross domestic product (GDP) and the national GDP were obtained from official data of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (2017) 17 . All the funding values presented herein were converted from the Brazilian real to the American dollar on April 30, 2020. Figure 1 (a) depicts the profile of the 91,589 and 6,329 COVID-19 cases and deaths, respectively, from the first case in Brazil up to May 1, 2020. The first research funding focused on COVID-19 was announced on March 21 during the early days of the outbreak, 24 days after the first confirmed case, four days after the first confirmed death, and when the number of accumulated cases and deaths were 1,128 and 18, respectively.The first funding announcement was made by FAPESP [ Figure 1 (b)], the foundation (FAP) of São Paulo state, which has the highest GDP in Brazil. The initial budget disclosed by FAPESP for financing COVID-19 related projects was US$ 1,842,842.40. The projects were intended to last for 24 months, but only researchers that already had ongoing projects supported by FAPESP could apply for this rapid funding program. Although not mandatory, the proposal had to be aligned with certain research interests, such as epidemiological features, virus characteristics, diagnostic tests, therapeutic evaluation and development, clinical procedures, and social behavior. It should be noted that FAPESP, in association with the Brazilian Innovation Agency (FINEP), also provided US$ 3,685,684.80 for projects focused on small-sized enterprises to develop technologies for products, services, and processes to fight COVID-19. This was beyond the scope of the current study.Five days after the FAPESP announced its funding opportunity [March 26, Figure 1 Foundation (FAPESB) disclosed a program that offered US$ 40,542.53 in financial support for projects with a maximum duration of 12 months. The proposals had to focus on topics related to the development of clinical protocols, therapeutic guidelines, software, pharmaceuticals, biological products, and equipment for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. On the same day [ Figure 1(b) ], the Rio de Janeiro State Research Support Foundation (FAPERJ) opened a program to support COVID-19 research, investing US$ 4,607,106.00. This program was divided into three lines, two were designed to support already granted projects, including projects with companies. The proposals had to address short-to-mediumterm solutions against COVID-19. The desired research topics were associated with diagnosis, epidemiology, clinical application, development of innovative technological solutions, and monitoring and forecasting the social impact of measures to deal with the pandemic. In these cases, only projects up to 12 months were accepted. The third program line was devoted to supporting up to six research networks for up to 24 months to deal with epidemic control, diagnostic tests, improvement of level 3 laboratory facilities in Rio de Janeiro State, clinical and epidemiological studies, and solutions involving up to medium-sized businesses. Finally, the last funding program was launched in March by the Minas Gerais State Research Support Foundation (FAPEMIG) which invested US$ 368,568.48 in projects of up to 12 months long.In April, nine more programs were disclosed [ Figure 1(b) ], including those of national foundations. On April 6, CNPq provided US$ 9,214,212.00 for proposals concerning the following research topics: COVID-19 treatment, vaccine, diagnosis, pathogenesis and natural history of the disease, disease burden, attention to health, prevention, and control. The deadline execution time was up to Figure 2(a) shows the relationship between the accumulated deaths and cases, as of May 1, and the FAPs that have disclosed funding programs. Most FAPs of federal units with few cases and deaths did not initially invest in research, while the FAPs of federal units with the most cases and deaths, São Paulo (SP) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ), did. One should note that some FAPs of federal units with comparatively high incidences of COVID-19, such as Ceará (CE) and Pernambuco (PE), did not follow the regional funding policy. However, in fact, both FAPs announced funding opportunities, but they did not meet the criteria to be included here. Figure 2(b) presents the ratio between the GDP per capita of each federal unit and the national GDP per capita. This shows that the financial strength of the federal unit was not decisive in opening funding initiatives, since FAPEPI from Piauí (PI), which has one of the lowest GDPs per capita in Brazil, was one of the FAPs that supported research on COVID-19. PI was also one of the federal units with the lowest accumulated deaths 4/7 Figure 2(a) ], suggesting that the number of cases and deaths did not always play a role in stimulating the emergency funding programs. Figure 3 shows a more detailed view of the investments made by the FAPs. Investment as a function of the federal unit GDP is presented in Figure 3(a) . FAPERJ from RJ was the FAP that provided both the highest total investment and investment relative to the federal unit GDP. Although SP is the federal unit with the highest GDP, the proportion of investment in COVID-19 research was less than that of poorer federal units, such as FAPESQPB from Paraíba (PB). However, the investment provided by FAPESP (SP) was only lower than that of FAPERJ (RJ) when considered a function of the federal unit GDP per capita [ Figure 3(b) ]. Another means of investigating these funding opportunities is by considering the investment as a function of the project duration [ Figure 3(c) ]. Again, FAPERJ (RJ) had the highest monthly investment, followed by FAPESP (SP) and FAPERGS (Rio Grande do Sul). Although FAPESQPB offered a comparatively elevated investment relative to its GDP, when the monthly investment was considered, it was much less than that of RJ.The areas of research interest of each public funding agency highlighted in the funding documents are summarized in Figure 4 . They are discussed here from most to least frequently researched. The most frequently researched topic was ""diagnosis,"" which reflects the search for rapid and reliable means to determine whether a person was infected with COVID-19. This is vital to 5/7 taking appropriate action against the spread of the disease and to manage infected individuals 18 . Meanwhile, ""artificial intelligence and information technology"" can be discussed mainly in terms of artificial intelligence (AI), which has been widely investigated as an efficient tool against COVID-19. Vaishya et al. listed the main possible applications of AI in the current pandemic 19 , including providing support for early diagnosis, monitoring treatment and virus spread, identifying ""hot-spots,"" predicting disease evolution, developing drugs and vaccines, and assisting healthcare workers 19 . ""Socioeconomic aspects,"" which comprises actions to avoid or mitigate social and economic impacts resulting from the measures taken to combat and control the COVID-19 outbreak, were also widely researched. The importance of this aspect is highlighted by FAPEAP (Amapá) providing financial support, albeit considerably miniscule, exclusively for proposals aiming to reduce regional economic adversities [Figure 1(b) ].Meanwhile, ""epidemiology"" investigated the damage caused by COVID-19 on the health of the Brazilian population to understand the potential impact of COVID-19 control measures, monitor the disease evolution, and developing strategies to end social distancing. ""Personal protective equipment (PPE) and supplies for healthcare workers"" were related to disease spread control. Given that the international supply chain has been affected by the pandemic 20 , the shortage of materials is a problem not just in Brazil but worldwide. Therefore, the development of innovative ideas to overcome the shortages for all kinds of suppliers is crucial. ""Therapeutic strategies"" were of interest due to the development of clinical protocols and therapeutic guidelines, while ""understanding the disease"" referred to genetic aspects of the virus and pathophysiology and clinical aspects of the disease. As for ""treatment,"" there has been interest in studying therapeutic alternatives for COVID-19, with focus on antiviral drugs. Along with ""treatment,"" ""vaccines and immunobiological products"" have also been researched. Worldwide, significant efforts have been made to develop effective vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 [21] [22] . Finally, the research interest topic that occurred the least was ""equipment for treatment,"" which comprises the development of low-cost pulmonary ventilators and equipment for treatment and isolation of patients. ""Others"" refers to studies in different fields that could not be fit into the other categories and were only mentioned once, such as the development of robotics for hospital applications.The present analysis focused on the response of public research funding agencies in Brazil to the early COVID-19 pandemic period. Science and technology research in Brazil has mainly been conducted by universities and research institutions, funded by the Brazilian government through public funding agencies. These funds are granted by federal agencies and FAPs, nationally and regionally, respectively. In the past few years, the total annual public research funding in Brazil has been around US$ 10 billion 15 . Over the first four months since the outbreak began in China, the public funding agencies of the eleven federal units and two federal agencies provided US$ 38,298,782.25 for scientific investigations. Although this amount is much lower than the total annual amount, it should be considered that it has been provided on an emergency basis, besides the fact that it may increase over the year.Brazil is a large country, geographically divided into 27 federal units (26 states and one federal district), but, according to the number of COVID-19 cases and GDP per capita, only 11 of these 27 units provided the US$ 8,734,872.48 in early funding opportunities for scientific researches. The number of cases and deaths did not always play a role in stimulating the emergency funding programs. The COVID-19 pandemic promoted a large worldwide commotion, probably encouraging some FAPs to provide research funding even if the number of cases were not high regionally. Furthermore, early actions could help to find better ways to manage and avoid possible future problems. A more detailed analysis investigated FAP investment as a function of the federal unit GDP. However, the results showed that the federal GDP did not affect the amount spent on research. Finally, the areas of research interest identified in the funding documents were classified. The topic with the highest and least occurrence were ""diagnosis"" and ""equipment for treatment,"" respectively.The main limitations of this study are related to the fact that only public notices with complete information (such as funding amount, project duration, and areas of research interest) were analyzed. Furthermore, only funding opportunities from government agencies using exclusively national resources were considered. This means that more resources may have been allocated for financing COVID-19 related projects during the analyzed period. Another point to be acknowledged is that the funding documents are not uniform in their contents, that is, the programs were not developed in the same way. For instance, two different programs were separately announced by FAPESP (SP), one developed for financing projects in universities and research institutions, and another for enterprises. On the other hand, although this study did not focus on projects to be exclusively performed by companies, it was not possible to make a clear division between the previous target audiences when analyzing the program disclosed by FAPERJ (RJ). This discrepancy may have contributed somewhat to the results showing the much higher investment amount provided by FAPERJ (RJ) in comparison with FAPESP (SP).This work showed that Brazilian researchers had access to funding opportunities for projects aiming to address issues related to COVID-19 since the beginning of the outbreak in Brazil. Nonetheless, future opportunities are at risk because of the economic impacts derived from the measures taken to control the disease. Accordingly, strategies to minimize the economic impacts of COVID-19 on public research and the public health system are vital in mitigating or avoiding substantial financial and social shortcomings, particularly from the perspective of an emerging market such as Brazil. Science and technology innovation and development in Brazil, especially during emergencies, may be conducted with cooperation between universities and industries. It has been shown that this may be beneficial and facilitate problemsolving 23 , and, in the long-term, the government, can provide a tax incentive to industries that worked with and continue to promote cooperation with universities. In the short-term, the Brazilian government and public research funding agencies will have to develop innovative solutions to overcome an economic crisis that is likely to have a strong effect on scientific activities, such as massive drops in funding, scientific publications, patents, and qualified human resources.",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-21,9
d462151843328fd8df1cb10630df1028aac08396,Analysis of internet trends related to medications for COVID-19 in ten countries with the highest number of cases,"Since first reported in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus now known as SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally. As of the second week of August 2020, the novel coronavirus disease pandemic has now reached over 21 million confirmed cases worldwide and approximately 762,000 deaths worldwide according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. COVID-19 case numbers are alarming in both their volume and widening geographic scope but there are also concerns about the accuracy of reported COVID-19 case numbers, particularly at earlier stages of the pandemic and in the last months within the LatinAmerican region , and whether underreporting may have blurred the true extent of the outbreak from the beginning and its health and economical impact. There are many studies using Google Trends to analyze, forecast topics related to dengue (Anggraeni and Aristiani 2016) , elections (Polykalas, Prezerakos, and Konidaris 2013), programming (Chen and Xing 2016) and recently, studying covid-19 topic in Ghana (Chire and Panford-Quainoo 2020) , France (Chire and Oblitas Cruz Copyright c 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. 2020) and South America Region (Chire and Mahmood 2020) .The contribution of this paper: • Study the interest of citizens through Google Search tool around medication for Covid-19 • Analyze the differences between trends in countries with high incidence of casesThe presented paper follows a methodology inspired on Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining(CRISP-DM) (Shearer 2000) . The steps for the conducted study are detailed in the next subsections.The first question to answer came from the announcements of new vacuum for coronavirus, therefore the question is: what treatment or medication is most popular in population? By consequence, to set the scope of the study, countries with more cases were selected. The analysis considers the ten countries (see Fig. 1 ) with more infections.Figure 1: Ten countries with the highest total cases 1The proposed terms are related to medication used in many countries, the terms are: Clhorine Dioxide, Ivermectin, Azithromycin, Dexamethasone, Prednisone, Desivir. These terms were selected a review of news from different countries about treatment against covid19.Trends using Google search can be useful to analyze how was the interest of one country/city around one term. Period of study: 01-07-2020 to 22-07-2020 and the terms were mentioned previously.After the collection of data from Google Trends, this step helps to present data and support analysis about covid19 and medication in Top 10 countries. Series plot to show the evolution from 01 to 22 July for the selected terms.The analysis is considering the next countries: Usa, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa, Peru, Mexico, Chile, Spain, Uk. Therefore, they are representing North America, South America, Asia, Europe. Table 1 is presenting the population of every country, number of covid19 total cases and proportion of total infections. It is important to consider that each country has different numbers of population then to observe the total number of cases is appropiate to analyze the proportion of total infections over the total population. If the analysis only considers data related to total cases of Table 1 , then Usa, Brazil and India are the three nations with more infections. But, considering column Percentage of Table 1 , Usa, Peru and Brazil are on the top. At the same time Usa is not the most populated country neither Brazil or Peru.Performing the query using the terms mentioned previously in the section of the proposal, results are in Figure 2 .Rusian, India presents a constant interest for Azythromycin. Chlorine dioxide in Peru, Mexico and Spain. Brazil, Mexico have a decay of interest about Ivermectine and Peru an increasing number during the last week. Prednisone in United States has a constant interest. Remdesivir has global decay from 01 July and a constant value for India. Dexamethasone for Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Peru has a constant interest.In conclusion, it is possible identify the interest of users using Google Trends which considers the searches made in one country to present the data.

003f0478223711437a50964fae472e3d5cb2659f,"Sleep Disturbances, Anxiety, and Burnout during the COVID-19 Pandemic: a nationwide cross-sectional study in Brazilian Healthcare Professionals","Considering the stressful routine and risk of infection by COVID-19 among healthcare professionals, it is conceivable that sleep disturbances are significantly impaired during the pandemic. This nationwide survey conducted in Brazil found that 41.4% developed new-onset or worsening of previous insomnia symptoms. Moreover, 572 (13%) of respondents initiated pharmacological treatments for insomnia. Females, weight change, anxiety, Burnout development, family income reduction >30%, and recent/current care of patients with COVID-19 were independently associated with the development of insomnia or exacerbated previous insomnia symptoms. Considering the potential impact of insomnia on work performance/healthcare decisions as well as the potential longterm dependence of pharmacological treatments for insomnia, this study underscores the need for dedicated sleep and mental health programs for healthcare professionals.The adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep quality and anxiety levels in the global population [1] [2] [3] [4] reinforces the need for urgent attention to sleep disorders and mental health globally. The lack of effective treatments or vaccines, the rapid dissemination of the virus, social distancing, decreased physical activity, the negative economic impact and even the alarming fake news are contributing to this scenario [5] [6] [7] .Healthcare professionals are particularly exposed to higher levels of stress and work demand [8] . In addition, healthcare professionals have a higher risk of contamination when compared to the general population [9] . Several reports [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] have discussed the potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic on sleep in healthcare professionals.Limitations of previous studies include one or more factors including small sample sizes, analysis of specific healthcare occupations, the lack of comparisons with the period pre-COVID-19, and lack of assessment of several variables associated with insomnia.In this large survey, we aimed to explore the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep, anxiety levels, and burnout symptoms in a large sample of healthcare professionals from Brazil. Our country has continental dimensions and is experiencing a high overall incidence of COVID-19, but with significant differences among each region. We assessed independent predictors of new-onset or worsening of preexisting insomnia (primary outcome) as well as sleep quality and sleep duration (secondary outcomes) among these professionals. We made the following hypothesis: 1)Healthcare professionals who had been previously contaminated with SARS-Cov-2 virus are less prone to develop sleep disturbances; 5) Sleep disturbances are more prevalent in areas with higher mortality by COVID-19.This cross-sectional study was reviewed and approved by the Hospital das Clínicas Institutional Review Board (CAAE: 31750920.9.0000.0068) and was exempted from a consent form. No participant identifier was required or recorded, preserving the anonymity of responders. The study report aimed at covering all items of the Strobe checklist for cross-sectional studies) [19] .Healthcare professionals were invited to participate through WhatsApp TM digital platform. Invitations were also sent by email using organizational mailing lists of healthcare professional associations. The survey was distributed and managed using REDCap TM electronic data capture tools hosted at the Hospital das Clínicas [20] . The survey remained active from 05/28/2020 to 06/28/2020. Participants had to be active healthcare professionals. No exclusion criterion but incomplete questionnaires for the main outcome was applied.All analyses were conducted using the software R 3.6.0 (R Core Team, 2019). Graphs were built with the ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2009). For comparisons of categorical variables, the χ2 test was performed. Normally distributed continuous variables were compared by using unpaired Student´s t-test or one-way ANOVA and presented as the means and SD. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare skewed variables and are presented as medians and interquartile ranges. We performed a logistic regression analysis to assess the influence of independent variables on the combination of newonset of insomnia symptoms and worsening of preexisting insomnia. Logistic regression was also used to determine the independent predictors of sleep quality and sleep duration. Adjusted estimates (odds ratio, OR) and their precision (95% confidence interval) are presented. The following variables were entered in the model: age, sex, health category, workplace, previous diagnosis of COVID-19, previous or current care of patients with COVID-19, regional death incidence of COVID-19 according to the epidemiological week in the individual's municipality, change in working hours, change in weight (no change, decrease or increase), the proportion of change in family income (no change, increase, decrease >0 but <30%, and decrease >30%), prevalent anxiety and change in burnout severity. For the secondary outcomes, insomnia was included in the regression model. For all statistical tests, a significance level of 5% was adopted.Incomplete responses were excluded preventing the need for imputation of missing values.were completed for the outcomes of interest (88.8% of the total). Methods applied for disseminating the link to the survey precluded the calculation of response rates.The distribution of responders across the Brazilian territory is shown on a heat map ( Figure S1 , online supplement), representing all geographic regions. Around half of the responders were physicians, followed by physiotherapists and nurses ( Figure S2 , online supplement)The characteristics of the studied population are shown in Table 1 . Overall, our sample comprised of middle-aged women. On average, participants reported a reduction of weekly working hours during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. (Table 1) , or reporting family income reduction ( Figure S8 ).Our survey showed that 1,817 out of 4,384 (41.4%) healthcare professionals presented new-onset insomnia during the pandemic or worsening of preexisting insomnia.The reduction of at least one hour of sleep was reported by 43.5% of the participants. In the logistic regression analysis, younger age, working at hospital wards, increase in weekly work hours, change in weight (increase or decrease), prevalent anxiety, newonset burnout and new-onset/worsening of insomnia were independently associated with an increased chance for reduction at least one hour of subjective sleep duration. In contrast, specific occupational categories (physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, and psychologists) and working in the operating room were independently associated with less chance of having a reduction at least one hour in the subjective sleep duration ( Figure 3 ). Detailed data on sleep quantity outcomes are presented in the supplemental file (Table S3 , online supplement).To our knowledge, this is the largest investigation addressing sleep disturbances among healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. This nationwide cross-sectional study comprising several occupational categories and multiple related factors revealed the following results: 1) Supporting our hypothesis, 41.4% of the healthcare professionals developed new-onset or worsening preexisting insomnia, which contributed to the initiation of pharmacological treatment for insomnia in 13% of the responders. Sleep quality and duration were also severely impaired by the pandemic.Sleep reduction of at least one hour was reported by 43.5% of participants. Younger age, working at hospital wards, increase in weekly work hours, change in weight (increase or decrease), prevalent anxiety, new-onset burnout, and new-onset/worsening of insomnia were associated with increased odds of reduction at least one hour of sleep duration. While several characteristics have plausibility for expecting a reduction in the subjective sleep duration during the pandemic, it is unclear the precise reason for the independent association of working in the hospital wards, in detriment to working in the emergency room or in intensive care units.The magnitude of our outcomes in health professionals is consistent with the previous literature. The high number of responses collected in such a short period represents one of the strengths of this study. Complete responses were obtained from all regions in Brazil, including responses from dwellers that work in healthcare in small, medium, and large municipalities.In conclusion, this nationwide survey comprising over 4,000 healthcare professionals in Brazil showed a high prevalence of new-onset or worsening previous insomnia that directly contributed to the initiation of pharmacological treatment for insomnia in a significant number of responders. Variables such as gender (females), significant family income reduction during the pandemic, weight change (decrease or increase), prevalent anxiety, burnout development, and previous or current care of patients with COVID-19were independently associated with the combined insomnia endpoints. Considering that insomnia may impact not only quality of life, but also work performance and that pharmacological treatment for insomnia may predispose to drug-dependence, this study underscores the need of dedicated programs for approaching insomnia (including CBT-I strategies), its comorbidities and potential triggering factors, particularly in susceptible profiles of healthcare professionals.We thank all health professionals that anonymously contributed to this survey, Tiago Mendonça, Stat, for his careful statistical analysis, Associação Brasileira do Sono (ABS) and Associação Brasileira de Medicina do Sono (ABMS) for providing funding support for the statistical analysis.Financial disclosure: None.Non-financial disclosure: None.All rights reserved.

4bde235aeeb14aab0e1aa6d40539ed43c698c258,"Original Research Increased prolonged sitting in rheumatoid arthritis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: a within-subjects, accelerometer-based study","Background: Social distancing measures designed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic can explicitly and implicitly restrict physical activity, a particular concern for high-risk patient groups. Using a within-subjects design with objective measurement (via validated accelerometers), we assessed rheumatoid arthritis patients' physical activity and sedentary behavior levels prior to and during the social distancing measures implemented in Sao Paulo, Brazil.Methods: Post-menopausal women diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis were assessed before (from March 2018 to March 2020) and during (from 24 th May to 7 th July 2020) social distancing measures to contain COVID-19 pandemic, using a within-subjects, repeated-measure design. Physical activity and sedentary behavior were assessed using postural-based accelerometry (ActivPAL micro™). Conclusion: Imposed social distancing measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak were associated with decreased physical activity and increased prolonged sitting among rheumatoid arthritis patients. Since this has the potential to increase the burden of cardiovascular disease in such high-risk patients, attention to maintaining physical activity is an urgent consideration during the pandemic.Physical inactivity and sedentary behavior are modifiable risk factors considered to be potential targets to prevent morbimortality in autoimmune rheumatic diseases (4, 5) . Among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, sedentary behavior is associated with higher disease scores, increased pain, fatigue (6) and number of comorbidities, reduced aerobic capacity (7) and physical function (6), and poor self-efficacy (8) . Furthermore, physically inactive RA patients exhibit higher cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., higher systolic blood pressure and HOMA index, abnormal lipid profile) when compared to their physically active counterparts.RA patients have been shown to be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection (9) and, therefore, may be subjected to more restrictive measures of social distancing, potentially with significant impacts on their activity options, and, hence, on their burden of cardiovascular disease risk, the main cause of mortality in this population (10) .Patients were asked if they had adhered to the social distancing measures. All but two responded affirmatively. Data were assessed with and without the two non-compliers, and results remained the same. Thus, we reported the full data.Patients were instructed to wear the accelerometer on the medial front of the right thigh during 7 days for 24 h. Data were exported and analyzed using ActivPAL3™ software, version 8.10.9.46 (PAL Technology, UK). Data was checked by an experienced researcher and also crosschecked with a sleep diary. Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was calculated as time spent above a step cadence of ≥ 100 steps/min (12) .Dependent variables were tested using repeated measures mixed models, with time as fixed factor and participants as random factor, using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, USA). Data are presented as mean (95%CI). The significance level was p≤0.05.Observational and experimental evidence demonstrates that inactivity can predispose to pathological states and poor outcomes (13) . Sedentary behavior can add to the adverse impacts of physical inactivity in impairing cardiovascular health (14) . Autoimmune rheumatic patients commonly spent most of their daily hours engaged in sedentary behavior and did not achieve minimum levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (5) .Namely in RA, the estimates of physical inactivity and sedentary behavior are comparable to those of other chronic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and associate with poor health-related outcomes (5) .The main strengths of this study are its within-subjects design and the use of posture-based accelerometers, which enables an objective and a comprehensive assessment of sedentary behavior patterns. The limitations include the relatively low sample size and the inability to stablish a cause-andeffect relationship between changes in behavior with social distancing measures, although elements of temporality and plausibility do support our assumptions.In conclusion, imposed social distancing measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak were associated with decreased physical activity and increased prolonged sitting time among RA patients. Since this has the potential to increase the burden of cardiovascular diseases in such high-risk patients, attention to maintaining their activity levels is an urgent consideration during the pandemic.",Brazil,first author,2020-09-11,9
0378d8c27c6ae38520d612d06f291257b97b41f6,SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19 in 5 Patients in Ecuador After Prior Treatment with Hydroxychloroquine for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus e927304-1,"In December 2019, an outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in the city of Wuhan, China, rapidly spread throughout the world, and was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 [1] . In Latin America, Ecuador is among the countries most affected by SARS-CoV-2, with more than 62 380 confirmed cases as of July 6, 2020, 26% of which were located in the coastal province of Guayas [2] .Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs and tissues. For this reason, diagnosis can be complex, relying on clinical and immunological findings and often using the 2019 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/ACR SLE classification criteria [3] . These require the presence of positive antinuclear antibodies, along with other criteria. These additional criteria include 7 clinical (constitutional, hematologic, neuropsychiatric, mucocutaneous, serosal, musculoskeletal, and renal) and 3 immunologic (antiphospholipid antibodies, complement proteins, and SLE-specific antibodies) criteria, with each criterion ranked from 2 to 10. Patients with 10 or more points are classified as having SLE.Currently, there are no vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2 and many drug strategies have been taken into consideration. One of the drugs that has been in the spotlight is the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, which is commonly used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Hydroxychloroquine was first used to treat cutaneous lupus in 1834 due to its anti-inflammatory properties, and since then has been considered among the mainstays of SLE treatment [4] . Hydroxychloroquine has a recommended initial dosage of 400 mg to be taken orally once or twice per day, and a maintenance dose between 200 and 400 mg per day [5] .Due to studies suggesting that hydroxychloroquine has antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, the drug was included in treatment strategies against COVID-19 starting July 1, 2020 [6, 7] . However, the FDA and others have suggested that it is ineffective and that, in fact, it carries the risk of adverse effects, the most predominant of which is cardiotoxicity (QT prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias, torsades des pointes, and conduction disorders) [8] . Other studies found that hydroxychloroquine did not reduce mortality or improve outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and did not help to prevent infection when it was used as post-exposure prophylaxis [9, 10] .In recent months, the use of hydroxychloroquine has generated differing opinions and has elicited many inquiries in the medical community. One of these is whether or not patients who have been using hydroxychloroquine for some time, such as SLE patients, are protected against SARS-CoV-2 [11] [12] [13] . In this case series, we describe 5 patients from Guayaquil, Ecuador, who were seen for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 after prior treatment with hydroxychloroquine for SLE.We present a report of 5 patients diagnosed with lupus who were treated at the Department of Rheumatology and Autoimmune Disease/Unidad de Enfermedades Reumáticas y Autoinmunes [UNERA], Clínica Alcívar, located in Guayaquil, Ecuador. All patients developed COVID-19. The data were collected between March 3 and May 21, 2020 (Tables 1, 2).A 29-year-old woman, with a 5-year history of SLE, had been treated with a daily dose of 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine since January, 2019. She presented to the clinic on March 3, 2020 after 4 days of flu-like symptoms, chest pain, fever, odynophagia, asthenia, dry cough, and chills. Her oxygen saturation was 99%. Physical examination was unremarkable and her vitals were within normal limits. Her laboratory findings revealed lymphopenia as the only abnormality. There were no abnormalities on chest X-ray. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal sample and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the Cepheid/GeneXpert system showed positive results. The patient was administered 500 mg per day of azithromycin for 5 days and continued taking hydroxychloroquine, which was already being used to treat her lupus. On March 25, 2020, her RT-PCR test came back negative for SARS-CoV-2.A 34-year-old woman with a 12-year history of SLE who had been treated with 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine per day since June 2017 presented to our clinic on April 20, 2020 after 1 week of having a dry cough, asthenia, and myalgias. The patient had been in close contact with a family member who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Her oxygen saturation was 99% on room air and clinical examination revealed normal organ findings. Her vital signs and her chest X-ray were normal. Laboratory results showed lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR testing from nasopharyngeal swabs using the Cepheid/GeneXpert system. This patient did not receive any additional medication to treat the infection besides hydroxychloroquine, which was part of her SLE treatment. Another test against SARS-CoV-2 was performed 2 weeks later and the results were negative.A 24-year-old woman with a 4-year history of SLE, who had been taking 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine per day as part of her SLE treatment since June 2010, presented to our clinic on Chest CT findings -chest computed tomography findings. * Patient had a ground-glass opacity (GGO) on the CT.April 5, 2020 after 2 days of asthenia, myalgias, headaches, hypogeusia, and anosmia. Her oxygen saturation was 97% and the physical exam was normal. Vitals were within normal limits and no abnormalities were found on chest X-ray. Laboratory testing was significant for leukopenia and lymphopenia. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal sample, using the Cepheid/GeneXpert system, came back positive on April 6, 2020. She received 500 mg per day of azithromycin for 5 days, along with hydroxychloroquine, which was already part of her lupus management. Four weeks after being diagnosed with the infection, her RT-PCR came back negative.A 39-year-old woman with a 13-year history of SLE, who had been taking hydroxychloroquine as part of her lupus regimen since July 2015, presented to our clinic on March 29, 2020 with a 3-day history of chest pain, odynophagia, hypogeusia, anosmia, diarrhea, and fever. Upon arrival, the patient was dyspneic and her oxygen saturation was 96%. Her heart rate was 115 beats/min. Given her clinical presentation, a CT scan was performed, which showed ground-glass opacities and consolidations that had recently developed since she had no other pathological images on previous scans. Routine blood test results revealed some abnormalities including lymphopenia, elevated values of D-dimer, and interleukin 6. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal sample using the Cepheid/ GeneXpert system showed positive results. Since this patient had a different clinical presentation from the cases mentioned above, in addition to the accepted therapy at the time (500 mg per day of azithromycin for 5 days and continuation of the hydroxychloroquine she was already taking for SLE), she received a daily dose of 40 mg of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The LMWH was administered subcutaneously for 10 days as a prophylactic measure due to her elevated levels of D-dimer. She also received 20 mg of prednisone for 10 days and an early dose of 400 mg per day of tocilizumab for 2 days.It is important to point out that interleukin 6 is believed to be a marker of poor prognosis in COVID-19. It plays a vital role in the development of cytokine storm and in potentially causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [14] , which might have contributed to some of our patient's clinical findings, such as dyspnea. Interestingly, however, she showed immediate improvement and it was not necessary to administer oxygen therapy or ventilator support. She tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on April 13, 2020.A 46-year-old woman with a past medical history of hypertension controlled with medication and a 6-year history of SLE had been taking 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine as a part of her SLE management since January 2019. She came to our clinic on April 28, 2020 with a 2-day history of chest pain, fever, and dyspnea. She had been in close contact with an individual who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Her oxygen saturation was 98% and blood pressure was 138/88 mmHg. Her chest X-ray did not show any alterations. The initial laboratory evaluation showed leucopenia, lymphopenia, and mildly elevated levels of interleukin 6. Given her clinical presentation and exposure to an infected person, a nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test (using the Cepheid/GeneXpert system) was performed, which was positive. To treat the COVID-19, she received 500 mg per day of azithromycin for 5 days, 200 mg of prednisone for 10 days, which was helpful to control her dyspnea and chest tightness, and her regular dose of hydroxychloroquine, which she had already been taking as part of her treatment for SLE. Her laboratory results came back negative for SARS-CoV-2 on May 21, 2020.It is also important to note that none of the patients required oxygen therapy, nor were any of them admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). None of the patients developed any serious complications such as ARDS or shock.Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that was originally approved by the Food and Drug Administration in April 1955 and has become part of current treatment guidelines for many rheumatic diseases, including lupus, due to its anti-inflammatory properties [15] . The main mechanisms of action of hydroxychloroquine on the immune system include interference with lysosomal acidification and inhibition of chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation. It also inhibits several inflammatory cytokines such as Il-1, IFNa, and TNF and interferes with Toll-like receptor signaling pathways [16] . The mechanism of action of hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 is not clearly understood, but it has been found that it changes the pH of endosomes and is believed to prevent viral entry, transport, and post-entry events [17] .There have been many inquiries in the medical community regarding the use of Hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic drug, with the Indian council of medical research empirically recommending the use of it as prophylaxis for asymptomatic healthcare workers and household contacts of confirmed cases in a dose of 400 mg twice per day on day 1 followed by 400 mg once per week for 7 weeks [18, 19] . On the other hand, it is also important to point out that some studies have not found hydroxychloroquine to be useful as post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 821 participants found that the incidence of COVID-19 did not differ significantly between those taking hydroxychloroquine within 4 days after exposure and those who received a placebo [20] . Another fundamental fact that must be considered is that the FDA issued a statement against hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19 use outside the hospital setting due to safety concerns, especially related to heart problems. This did not include FDA-approved uses for malaria and autoimmune diseases [21] .Our patients had already been taking hydroxychloroquine for treatment of SLE. We did not find that this drug prevented them from contracting COVID-19. This finding is consistent with that of a study conducted in France, in which data were collected from 17 patients with lupus who had been taking hydroxychloroquine for a median duration of 7.5 years; 76% of these patients developed COVID-19 [22] . Another study, conducted by the Global Rheumatology Alliance, looked at 110 patients with rheumatic disease and showed that 17% of the patients who developed COVID-19 also had lupus [23] .One caveat worth noting is that none of our patients developed severe COVID-19 complications; this may be due to the early administration of hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin. Million et al. reported similar findings in a study of 1061 patients with COVID-19 who received early administration of hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin: only 4.4% of their population had a poor clinical outcome [24] .Based on our observations, we can conclude that our 5 patients with SLE who were taking hydroxychloroquine presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms of COVID-19. This case series supports other evidence that hydroxychloroquine is not able to prevent COVID-19. However, it should be noted that 4 of our patients managed this disease at a time when the viral load affecting the population was very high, but presented with only mild-moderate symptoms.Did hydroxychloroquine influence this outcome? It is still unclear. Further studies will be needed to get a better understanding of the clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with SLE treated with hydroxychloroquine.",Ecuador,abstract,2020-09-26,9
bb50b9da4d261ee9ffd57a391fa17454b8956e54,On the Analysis of Mortality Risk Factors for Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: a Data-driven Study Using the Major Brazilian Database,"A new highly infectious-contagious coronavirus for humans emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan (Hubei province, China) [1] , [2] . The initial outbreak in the Chinese region spread rapidly, but only on March 11, 2020 it was recognized as a pandemic by WHO [3] . The disease, called COVID-19, can cause severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection. However, compared to other respiratory coronavirus syndromes (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), the mortality rate is low despite the high potential for spread [4] .The worldwide traffic of people facilitated the rapid spread of COVID-19, reaching countries on all continents in a short time. According to WHO data from September 15, 2020, more than 29 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed, including over 920,000 deaths worldwide. Brazil has officially recorded the first case of COVID-19 on February 26, 2020, and has become the epicenter of the pandemic with over 4.3 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 131,000 deaths on September 15, 2020 [5] .COVID-19 has a broad spectrum of the disease, ranging from asymptomatic to extremely severe cases. According to WHO, the majority (about 80%) of COVID-19 patients is asymptomatic or mild, 15% are severe, requiring oxygen, and 5% are critical cases demanding mechanical ventilation [5] . However, recent studies suggest that asymptomatic individuals are 40 to 45% of the infected population [6] or even only 20% [7] .The symptomatic infection is characterized by fever, generalized weakness, dry cough, headache, dyspnoea, and myalgia, as well as leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia, high levels of C-reactive protein, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase and inflammatory cytokines [8] , [2] , [9] and loss of smell and taste in the initial stage of infection [10] . Although biomarkers such as lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer and inflammatory cytokines, as well as chest computed tomography are good disease indicators, these tests are not routinely performed in most health centers. Therefore, in clinical practice, this parameter set does not help in the diagnosis and prognosis of the affected population, mainly in developing countries.Symptomatic cases of COVID-19 may progress to recovery or a very severe condition, characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm, blood coagulation dysfunction, acute cardiac and kidney injury, and multi-organ dysfunction, resulting in patient death [1] , [11] , [12] , [13] . Age and comorbidities may influence the disease outcome. In fact, several studies have shown that the elderly and the presence of comorbidities such as heart disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease and obesity contribute to a more severe infection outcome [9] , [14] .There is still no vaccine or therapeutic drugs for the specific treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, quarantine and social distancing are being the recommended measures in an attempt to reduce the infection rate in order to avoid overloading healthcare systems [15] .In Brazil, it is believed that the health system will collapse for patients with COVID-19 due to the lack of beds, ventilators in ICUs and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) by health professionals given the growing number of cases beyond seasonal influenza cases. Bed occupancy in several Brazilian states is over 80%, at a time when the country reached the peak of the pandemic and continues on a high plateau. This is also true in many other countries. Thus, the screening of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at risk of poor prognosis, requiring admission to the ICU and mechanical ventilation, could improve the flow of care in hospitals, avoid overload and contribute to reducing the mortality rate.Data from unidentified COVID-19 positive patients who have been hospitalized are available on the integrated health surveillance platform of the Brazil Ministry of Health. However, the database, named Brazilian Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Database of the SIVEP Gripe 1 (Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe) including data from COVID-19 in addition to Influenza, displays incomplete reports for demographic data, symptoms, comorbidities, ICU admission, etc.A comprehensive study on the characteristics and risk factors of Brazilian COVID-19 patients is missing. Thus, herein, we propose:• Building a dataset containing demographic data, clinical symptoms and comorbidities, ICU admission and use of mechanical ventilation of Brazilian hospitalized COVID-19 patients: those who were discharged and those who deceased, in order to investigate possible risk factors.• Analyzing the mortality risk factors for different subgroups of hospitalized COVID-19 patients using the created dataset. 1 . https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/bd-srag-2020 This retrospective study is based on a publicly available database and did not directly involve patients; it did not require approval by an ethics committee.In order to build the dataset to outline the profiles of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we downloaded data from the Brazilian Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Database (SIVEP-Gripe, 2020) covering the time from February 26 to August 10, 2020. As shown in Figure 1 , 225,987 patients were positive SARS-COV-2 confirmed by RT-PCR method, with 208,969 patients being admitted to hospital according to information contained in SIVEP Database. We used in our study data from 162,045 patients who had closed outcome (cure or death) in order to provide a profile overview of the patients and after, a 44,128 patients cohort with full symptom/comorbidity information aiming to analyze risk factors for mortality.Categorical variables are given in absolute numbers and percentages. Continuous variables are reported through medians with IQRs (interquartile range). Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using a generalization of the log-rank test, which can deal with n > 2 populations. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) in simple and multiple regression models analysis. Variables in the adjusted models were selected following the strategy proposed by Collett [16] , consisting of a step-wise, iterative, optimizing algorithm 2 started with all variables with p < 0.10 on the simple regression analysis.All analyses were performed using Python (version 3.6.9) and the statistical package lifelines (version 0.24.16) [17] .Our study dataset included information of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, confirmed by RT-PCR. Demographic data of the study population were disaggregated into the cure and death subgroups ( Table 1 ). The overall mortality rate was 41.28%, with a predominance of cases in the Southeast region (58.96%) in the covered period. The number of cases was higher among the elderly over 60 years (53.20%), male gender (56.56%) and, white (50.25%) and brown color patients (41.03%).The distribution by sex and age group is shown in Figure  2 . The mortality rate in hospitalized COVID-19 patients 2. The algorithm minimizes −2logL, whereL stands for the maximum likelihood of a variable. a. blood oxygen saturation aged <20 years was very low, in accordance with observations made in other populations. The mortality rate was higher in the elderly of both sexes. Besides a higher hospitalization rate in male gender (56.56%), the mortality rate was significantly higher in males (57.97%) compared to females (42.03%) (p < 0.001) ( Table 1) . Moreover, age-disaggregated data ( Figure 2 ) shows that the influence of gender on the risk of death is dependent on the age range.Lethality rate analysis showed a high rate in the North/Northeast region, in the highest age groups, in nonwhite populations and in the lowest educational levels (see Table 1 and Figure 3 ). The higher mortality in the North/Northeast region may be due to socioeconomic conditions and availability of beds in the ICU. On the other hand, it may also be due to the lack of appropriate knowledge about the characteristics of the new disease whose spread was highest in this region at the beginning of the pandemic.The most frequent symptoms and comorbidities in hospitalized COVID-19 patients are shown in Figure 4 and Table 2 . Importantly, cough, dyspnoea, fever, low oxygen saturation and respiratory distress (Figure 4a ), and heart disease, diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, neuropathy, and pneumopathy ( Figure 4b ) were more prevalent.Additional information from hospitalized COVID-19 patients is shown in Table 3 . The ICU admission rate was 39.37% (of n=145,053), with 62.40% death. In addition, 24.41% (of n=138,962) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and of these 82.98% died. In contrast, only 31.83% died among those who required non-invasive ventilation. At least 72% (of n=138,962) required some kind of ventilation, indicating that hospitalized patients can lead to the collapse of healthcare systems. The mortality rate in the Influenza vaccinated group (33.64% of n=62.695) and in the Influenza antiviral group (37.92% of n=124,844) were 37.82% and 39.80%, respectively.Cox regression model was adapted for simple and multiple regression analyses, considering the time between hospitalization and outcome (median=8 days, . Such analyzes were based only on patients with complete (Tables S1, S2 and S3 ). Vaccine and antiviral information were considered negative in the absence of data. The general characteristics of this subgroup are representative of the study population presented in Tables 1, 2 and 3.Although the lethality rate is ≈3.5% for notified COVID-19 cases in Brazil, among hospitalized patients the condition is very critical, with a ≈41% lethality according to Table 1 . Mortality HRs for hospitalized COVID-19 patients are shown in Figure 5 .The simple Cox regression analysis presented 26 variables 3 (out of 28) as potential increase/decrease risk factors for mortality (Table S4 ). However, after applying the variable selection strategy [16] for a multiple regression model, 20 variables remained statistically significant in the multiple regression analysis (Table 4 ), with a model concordance index of 0.69.It is interesting to note that ICU admission was not a risk factor for mortality, emphasizing that the most important feature is the invasive or non-invasive ventilation requirement. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the most significant prognostic factors (older age and ventilation requirement) are shown in Figure 6 . Ventilation requirement was a strong predictor of mortality risk factor, as shown in Figure 6a , as well as older age (Figure 6b ).Hospitalized COVID-19 patients data was disaggregated according to ventilation requirement and age range, whose hazard ratios are shown in Figures 7 and 8 , respectively (all data referring to such figures are presented in supplementary Tables S5-S11). In this case, a multiple Cox regression model was fitted for each subgroup, following the same variable selection strategy described before. Therefore, a different set of variables showed significant in each subgroup.The analysis of risk factors for different age subgroups unveiled interesting results ( Figure 8 ). Respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation were a risk factor for all ages and dyspnoea for patients over 40 years old. Ventilation requirement (IMV or NIV) are mortality risk factors for all ages, but it should be noted that IMV is a relevant risk factor especially for patients <40 years.Importantly, diabetes (HR=1.43; 95% CI, 1.23-1.67) and immunodepression (HR=1.35; 95% CI, 1.12-1.63) are also mortality risk factors especially for younger patients (<40 years). The disaggregation by age range showed an interesting result for the Influenza vaccine. There was a reduction in the mortality risk for vaccinated patients aged <40 years (HR=0.74; CI95%, 0.58-0.95). On the other hand, Influenza antiviral showed a reduced risk of mortality for patients ¿40 years.In synthesis, hospitalized COVID-19 patients <40 years who are diabetic, immunosuppressed and requiring ventilatory support (IMV or NIV) are more vulnerable to the disease. On the other hand, older patients, male gender, presenting problems related to respiratory function and comorbidities such as liver disease, diabetes, neuropathy, immunodepression, kidney disease and requiring mechanical ventilation are at high mortality risk.Using the major Brazilian database for COVID-19 cases registration, we built a comprehensive dataset containing demographic data, clinical characteristics and comorbidities of hospitalized patients in order to investigate the epidemiological and clinical profile of the study population and the main mortality risk factors. The analysis of mortality risk factors is relevant to define criteria for classifying the severity of the disease and to provide better care to those who may need ICU admission and ventilatory support.The profile of Brazilian hospitalized patients who deceased is similar to hospitalized U.S. patients who died, whose characteristics were older age, male gender, immunosuppression, kidney disease, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, neurologic disorders, and diabetes [18] .A meta-analysis including COVID-19 patients from different countries showed that age is a determining factor on mortality, especially above 60 years of age [19] . Although susceptibility to infection may be similar in different age ranges, studies suggest that susceptibility to symptomatic infection increases with age, possibly related to immunosenescence and unregulated immune response [20] . A recent study showed that although the fatality rate is higher in the elderly population, the lethality associated with hypertension and diabetes comorbidities is more pronounced in younger people [21] . Here, we also observed that younger brazilian patients with diabetes and immunosuppression comorbidities are also more vulnerable to COVID-19.In addition to older age, we found that male gender is an independent risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients. Our data are in line with a large study that covered data from 23 European countries, which showed that the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients is significantly higher in male than in female, regardless of socioeconomic characteristics and health systems in these countries [22] . A study conducted with hospitalized COVID-19 patients using the same Brazilian database showed that the mortality rate in the North region is higher, and in Pardo and Black patients, at least partly due to non-ICU admission [23] . Our data demonstrated that the mortality rate is higher in the North/Northeast region and among brown color patients being in agreement with this study.A study using the same database (SIVEP-gripe) covering the period from January 1st, 2020 to June 8th, 2020 found that COVID-19 patients who received a recent influenza vaccine (n=36,650) had 8% less chance to need intensive care, 18% less chance of requiring invasive ventilation and 17% less chance of death [24] . However, in our multiple Cox regression analysis (n=62,695 with vaccine status), we found no significant association between influenza vaccination and reduced risk of death, except for specific subgroups: patients under 40 years old and patients with IMV requirement. These differences may be due to our data extension (February 26 to August 10, 2020), a period when the majority of the population had been vaccinated in the 2020 campaign.The characterization of the profile of Brazilian patients admitted to ICU and requiring ventilation is relevant, as it can contribute to better care and reduced mortality. A recent review and meta-analysis involving COVID-19 patient data from several countries showed an ICU admission rate of 32%. The prevalence of mortality in the ICU was 39%, whereas in China this rate was higher, 42% [29] . Our analysis indicated that the events are more critical in Brazil, with 39.37% ICU admission and 62.40% mortality rate (Table  3) , which may be related to infrastructure and availability of health professionals in public and private hospitals.In accordance with some studies [25] , [30] , our data show that the invasive mechanical ventilation requirement among hospitalized COVID-19 patients is significant (24.41%), and with a extremely high mortality rate (82.98%) ( Table 3) . These data may be due to the high percentage of severely ill-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.A meta-analysis study compiling data from several countries showed broad variability in ICU admission, IMV requirement and IMV mortality rates [31] . Brazilian COVID-19 patients ICU admission rate (39.37%) was similar a USA patients (35%). However, ICU mortality rate was extremely high (62.40%) compared to UK (33%), USA (29%), Italy (26%), China (24%), Spain (23%), France (15%), and Mexico (2%). Likewise, IMV patients mortality rate (82.98%) was higher than China (59%), UK (53%), USA (24%) and Mexico (4%). These high mortality rates may be due to late admission to the ICU and delay in the mechanical ventilation introduction, or even the need to change the care protocol.A recent study showed that asthmatic patients are not at risk and do not develop severe SARS-COV-2 pneumonia compared to non-asthmatic patients [32] . In fact, we observed a low prevalence of asthmatic individuals (7.15%) among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, in agreement with the existing reports. Of note, the rate of cured asthmatics was twice that of those who died (Table 2) and asthma did not appear as a mortality risk factor (HR=0.82; 95% CI, 0.76-0.88, p<0.001). It is speculated that type 2 immune response and therapeutic drugs used for asthma may have a potential protective effect [33] .Highly prevalent comorbidities among hospitalized COVID-19 patients were cardiac disease and diabetes, which is in line with observations made in other populations [8] , [12] . In our previous cohort study on outpatients from a Brazilian state (ES) [34] , we found a prevalence of 18.55% for cardiac disease and 7.89% for diabetes. Mortality rates in this cohort were 50.05% and 31.82% for cardiac and diabetic patients, respectively. Here, the in-patient study showed a prevalence of 65.7% and 53.55% for cardiac disease and diabetes comorbidities, respectively (Table 2) . Mortality rates for patients with such comorbidities are extremely high, around 50%. Therefore, these observations indicate that patients with cardiac disease and diabetes are subgroups that deserve special attention.Among the limitations of the study, we highlight the absence of data from biochemical tests of patients in SIVEP-GRIPE Database, which are relevant in prognostic studies. Another aspect is the notification data of only hospitalized COVID-19 patients, so that we were unable to trace the profile of outpatients. However, our previous study using a dataset from Espírito Santo state [34] can be used for comparative purposes, as it involved COVID-19 outpatients.Taken together, our study provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiological and clinical profile of Brazilian hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the analysis of the risk factors for mortality. We verified that older age and IMV requirement were the most significant risk factors for mortality, besides male gender and the presence of comorbidities. In the absence of vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs, prevention is the best strategy to protect people, specially this most vulnerable segment of the population.",Brazil,abstract,2020-09-25,9
